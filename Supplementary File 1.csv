31554915,"Receptors are essential mediators of cellular physiology, which facilitate molecular and cellular cross-talk with the environment. Nearly 20% of the all known celiac disease (CD) genes are receptors by function. We hypothesized that novel biologically relevant susceptibility receptor genes act in synergy in CD pathogenesis. We attempted to identify novel receptor genes in CD by re-analyzing published Illumina Immunochip dense genotype data for a north Indian and  a European (Dutch) cohort. North Indian dataset was screened for 269 known receptor genes. Association statistics for SNPs were considered with minor allele frequency >15% and association P ≤ 0.005 to attend desired study power. Identified markers were tested for cross-ethnic replication in a European CD dataset. Markers were analyzed in-silico to explain their functional significance in CD. Six novel SNPs from MOG (rs29231, p = 1.21e-11), GABBR1 (rs3025643, p = 1.60e-7), OR2H2 (rs1233388, p = 0.0002), ABCF1 (rs9262119, p = 0.0005), ADRA1A (rs10102024, p = 0.003), and ACVR2A (rs7560426, p = 0.004) were identified in north Indians, of which three genes namely, GABBR1 (rs3025643, p = 5.38e-8), OR2H2 (rs1233388, p = 3.29e-5) and ABCF1 (rs9262119, p = 0.0002) were replicated in Dutch. Tissue specific functional annotation, potential epigenetic regulation, co-expression, protein-protein interaction and pathway enrichment analyses indicated differential expression and synergistic function of key genes that could alter cellular homeostasis, ubiquitination mediated phagosome pathway and cellular protein processing to contribute for CD. At present multiple therapeutic compounds/drugs are available targeting GABBR1 and ADRA1A, which could be tested for their effectiveness against CD in controlled drug trials.",1
31548400,"Mutations in the <i>iPLA2-VIA/PLA2G6</i> gene are responsible for <i>PARK14</i>-linked Parkinson's disease (PD) with α-synucleinopathy. However, it is unclear how <i>iPLA2-VIA</i> mutations lead to α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregation and dopaminergic (DA) neurodegeneration. Here, we report that <i>iPLA2-VIA</i>-deficient <i>Drosophila</i> exhibits defects in neurotransmission during early developmental stages and progressive cell loss throughout the brain, including degeneration of the DA neurons. Lipid analysis of brain tissues reveals that the acyl-chain length of phospholipids is shortened by <i>iPLA2-VIA</i> loss, which causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through membrane lipid disequilibrium. The introduction of wild-type human iPLA2-VIA or the mitochondria-ER contact site-resident protein C19orf12 in <i>iPLA2-VIA</i>-deficient flies rescues the phenotypes associated with altered lipid composition, ER stress, and DA neurodegeneration, whereas the introduction of a disease-associated missense mutant, <i>iPLA2-VIA</i> A80T, fails to suppress these phenotypes. The acceleration of α-Syn aggregation by <i>iPLA2-VIA</i> loss is suppressed by the administration of linoleic acid, correcting the brain lipid composition. Our findings suggest that membrane remodeling by iPLA2-VIA is required for the survival of DA neurons and α-Syn stability.",1
31519377,"Apolipoprotein (Apo)A-I is a major protein component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) that causes cholesterol efflux from peripheral cells through ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and the generation of HDL. Furthermore, it has a possible protective function against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). We previously developed a novel ApoA-I mimetic peptide without phospholipids (Fukuoka University ApoA-I Mimetic Peptide, FAMP). According to our previous studies, FAMP had an anti-arteriosclerotic effect. Since the required dose and reaction time of conventional FAMP were relatively large and short, respectively, we newly developed an improved FAMP (i-FAMP).",1
31515251,"Leukemia stem cells are a rare population with a primitive progenitor phenotype that can initiate, sustain, and recapitulate leukemia through a poorly understood mechanism of self-renewal. Here, we report that KLF4 promotes disease progression in a murine model of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-like myeloproliferative neoplasia by repressing an inhibitory mechanism of preservation in leukemia stem/progenitor cells with leukemia-initiating capacity. Deletion of the <i>Klf4</i> gene severely abrogated the maintenance of BCR-ABL1(p210)-induced CML by impairing survival and self-renewal in BCR-ABL1<sup>+</sup> CD150<sup>+</sup> LSK leukemic cells. Mechanistically, KLF4 repressed the <i>Dyrk2</i> gene in leukemic stem/progenitor cells; thus, loss of KLF4 resulted in elevated levels of DYRK2 kinase, which were associated with inhibition of survival and self-renewal via depletion of c-Myc protein and p53 activation. In addition to transcriptional regulation, stabilization of DYRK2 protein by inhibiting ubiquitin E3 ligase SIAH2 with vitamin K3 promoted apoptosis and abrogated self-renewal in murine and human CML stem/progenitor cells. Altogether, our results suggest that DYRK2 is a molecular checkpoint controlling both p53 and c-Myc-mediated regulation of survival and self-renewal in CML cells with leukemic-initiating capacity that can be targeted with small molecules.",1
31492748,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have essential roles in diverse cellular processes, both in normal and diseased cell types, and thus have emerged as potential therapeutic targets. A specific member of this family, the SWI/SNF complex antagonist associated with prostate cancer 1 (<i>SChLAP1</i>), has been shown to promote aggressive prostate cancer growth by antagonizing the SWI/SNF complex and therefore serves as a biomarker for poor prognosis. Here, we investigated whether <i>SChLAP1</i> plays a potential role in the development of human glioblastoma (GBM).",1
31491787,": Reports of resistance to integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are now not uncommon. We analyzed the HIV int gene from plasma of antiretroviral-naïve individuals during acute and chronic HIV-1 infection. No individual with major INSTI mutations was identified. Two individuals harbored INSTI accessory mutations E157Q/T97A were detected for the first time. Our results emphasize the need to consider testing for INSTI resistance at baseline as this class of drugs is increasingly used in clinical routine.",1
31423174,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the primary subtype of lung cancer. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to serve prominent roles in cancer progression. However, the expression patterns and potential roles of lncRNAs in NSCLC remain to be elucidated. In the present study, four public datasets were analyzed to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncs) in NSCLC. A further dataset, GSE19188, was analyzed to validate the findings. A total of 38 upregulated and 31 downregulated lncRNAs were identified in NSCLC, compared with samples from healthy controls. Among these, 12 lncRNAs were associated with the progression of NSCLC, and dysregulated between high grade (stage III and IV) and low grade (stage II) NSCLC samples. Moreover, dysregulation of lncRNA-SIGLEC17P, GGTA1P, A2M-AS1, LINC00938, GVINP1, LINC00667 and TMPO-AS1 was associated with overall survival time in patients with NSCLC. Co-expression analyses, combined with the construction of protein-protein interaction networks, were performed to reveal the potential roles of key lncRNAs in NSCLC. The present study revealed a series of lncRNAs involved in the progression of NSCLS, which may serve as novel biomarkers for the disease.",1
31396649,"Spexin (SPX) is a novel peptide with pleiotropic functions in adipose tissue including energy balance adjustment, fatty acid uptake, and glucose homeostasis. SPX level is closely associated with cardiovascular risk factors such as age, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes; however, its physiological significance in the cardiovascular system remains mostly undefined. We therefore here investigated the roles of SPX in regulating hypoxia-induced alterations in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. We firstly confirmed that SPX is expressed in human and mouse cardiac tissue and documented that exposure to hypoxia in vitro reduces SPX level in rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes and primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). We then treated primary NRVMs with SPX before exposure to hypoxia, which (1) promoted fatty acid metabolism by enhancing expression of FAT/CD36, CPT1, ACADM, and PPAR-a and PGC1-a; (2) did not improve impaired glucose uptake; and (3) significantly prevented the downregulation of TFAM and mitochondrial electron transport chain complex and restrained UCP2 level and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thus enhancing ATP level in cardiomyocytes. In summary, SPX protects energy and mitochondrial homeostasis of cardiomyocytes during hypoxia, thereby highlighting the potential importance of SPX in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",1
31381608,"Enteroviruses, members of the family of picornaviruses, are the most common viral infectious agents in humans causing a broad spectrum of diseases ranging from mild respiratory illnesses to life-threatening infections. To efficiently replicate within the host cell, enteroviruses hijack several host factors, such as ACBD3. ACBD3 facilitates replication of various enterovirus species, however, structural determinants of ACBD3 recruitment to the viral replication sites are poorly understood. Here, we present a structural characterization of the interaction between ACBD3 and the non-structural 3A proteins of four representative enteroviruses (poliovirus, enterovirus A71, enterovirus D68, and rhinovirus B14). In addition, we describe the details of the 3A-3A interaction causing the assembly of the ACBD3-3A heterotetramers and the interaction between the ACBD3-3A complex and the lipid bilayer. Using structure-guided identification of the point mutations disrupting these interactions, we demonstrate their roles in the intracellular localization of these proteins, recruitment of downstream effectors of ACBD3, and facilitation of enterovirus replication. These structures uncovered a striking convergence in the mechanisms of how enteroviruses and kobuviruses, members of a distinct group of picornaviruses that also rely on ACBD3, recruit ACBD3 and its downstream effectors to the sites of viral replication.",1
31361503,"Drug metabolism is one of the most important processes involving a drug after administration. Undesirable pharmacokinetic properties may lead to drug discontinuation. In the past several decades, a number of drugs have been withdrawn from the market due to safety issues caused by metabolites, especially reactive metabolites (RMs). Area covered: The focus of this review is on the role that drug metabolites play in drug discovery and developmental stages, with particular emphasis on metabolism-guided lead optimization, safety assessment of drug metabolites, drug-drug interaction potential of metabolites, and RMs safety assessment. In addition, species-related metabolic differences are briefly covered. Expert opinion: For the safety assessment of drug metabolites, a number of factors should be given full consideration, such as dose, in vitro and in vivo correlations, in vivo animal toxicological findings, and the accumulation of metabolites in plasma and/or tissues. Several factors, especially dose and multiple metabolic pathways, can significantly affect the occurrence of idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions (IADRs). Multiple assays should be used to assess RMs and thus avoid false-negative results. There is no clear interplay between the formation of RMs and the occurrence of IADRs. Avoidance of structural alerts and decreasing dose are the most effective strategies in reducing the risk of IADRs.",0
31358055,"Familial hypercholesterolemia type IIA (FH) is due to mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) resulting in elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) in plasma and in premature cardiovascular diseases. As hepatocytes are the only cells capable of metabolizing cholesterol, they are therefore the target cells for cell/gene therapy approaches in the treatment of lipid metabolism disorders. Furthermore, the LDLR has been reported to be involved in hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry into hepatocytes; however, its role in the virus infection cycle is still disputed.",1
31335167,"This study aims to investigate whether a relationship exists between the <i>C3435T</i> polymorphism of <i>ABCB1</i> gene and poststroke depression (PSD). A total of 82 PSD patients and 115 nondepression patient (NPSD) controls were included in this study. All patients were evaluated using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression to determine the severity of depression and complete the packet. PSD patients were diagnosed in accordance with the DSM-V criteria. The <i>C3435T</i> polymorphism of <i>ABCB1</i> was genotyped through fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization and chromosome karyotype analysis system. The PSD (<i>n</i> = 82) and NPSD groups (<i>n</i> = 115) had a total prevalence rate of 41.6%. The prevalence of PSD in men was 58.5%, whereas that in women was 41.5%, and no statistically significant difference existed between the two groups (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> = 1.009; <i>p</i> = 0.315). The CC, CT, and TT frequencies of the PSD group were 26.8%, 47.6%, and 25.6%, respectively, whereas those of the NPSD group were 42.6%, 45.2%, and 12.2%, respectively. Based on the CC genotype, the relative risk of homozygous mutant TT was 3.341 (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> = 7.869; <i>p</i> = 0.005; OR = 3.341), and the T allele frequency in the PSD group was 49.4% higher than that in the NPSD group. The locus gene frequency was 34.8%, and the relative risk of allele T relative to allele C was 1.830 (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> = 8.381; <i>p</i> = 0.004; OR = 1.830). A certain correlation exists between the C3435T gene polymorphism and PSD in the Han population in South Anhui Province, China, and further studies are needed to confirm our findings.",1
31325607,"Low bone mineral density (BMD) is a high-risk factor of osteoporosis (OP) and osteoporotic fracture (OF). Peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) can give birth to osteoclasts to resorb bone. Herein, we attempted to identify OP susceptible proteins in human PBM and characterize their functions in bone. Employing the label-free quantitative proteomics methodology (Easy-nLC1000 and Q-exactive) and traditional Western Blotting (WB), we discovered and validated that a key protein, i.e. Abl Interactor 1(ABI1), was significantly down-regulated in PBM in Chinese elderly men with extremely low vs. high BMD (n = 18, p < .05), as well as in OF patients vs. non-fractured (NF) subjects (n = 36, p < .05). The above down-regulation tendency was also observed in Chinese elderly women (n = 51, P < .05). For translational purpose, plasma ABI1 protein was assessed by ELISA in Chinese elderly men, which was found significantly down-regulated in OF (n = 20) vs. NF (n = 64) subjects (Mean: 0.41 vs. 1.03 ng/ml, FC = 0.39, p = .039), as well as in low (n = 32) vs. high (n = 32) BMD subjects (Mean: 0.5 vs. 1.57 ng/ml, FC = 0.32,p = .0012). ROC analyses in another independent study sample (n = 75) showed that the plasma ABI1 protein has superior performance in discriminating osteopenia and healthy subjects (AUC = 0.755, 95% CI: 0.632-0.877, p = .001). Follow-up cellular functional studies revealed that ABI1 protein significantly promoted osteoblast growth (optimal concentration 2.0 ng/ml), osteoblastic gene expression (OPN, ALP, COL1A1, p < .05) and osteoblast differentiation.ABI1 protein also significantly attenuated monocyte trans-endothelial migration and osteoclast differentiation and activity. In conclusion, ABI1 is a novel protein biomarker for OP in Chinese elderly. ABI1 protein, via promoting osteoblast growth, differentiation and activity, and attenuating monocyte trans-endothelial migration and osteoclast differentiation, influences BMD variation and fracture risk in humans. SIGNIFICANCE: Previous plentiful studies indicated that protein ABI1 played an essential role in the progression of several malignancies, including hepatoma, colon cancer and epithelial ovarian cancer. However, there was relatively limited understandings regarding its molecular and cellular functions relevant to bone phenotypes. Employing the label-free quantitative proteomics methodology (Easy-nLC1000 and Q-exactive) and traditional Western Blotting (WB), we discovered and validated that ABI1 was significantly down-regulated in PBM in Chinese elderly men with extremely low BMD as well as in OF patients. The down-regulation trend was consistent in plasma samples in Chinese elderly men. Follow-up cellular functional studies revealed that, on the one hand, ABI1 protein significantly promoted osteoblast growth, osteoblastic gene expression and osteoblast differentiation; on the other hand, it also significantly attenuated monocyte trans-endothelial migration and osteoclast differentiation and activity. It suggested that ABI1 is a promising biomarker with translational value.",1
31316987,"Kallikrein-K1 is the main kinin-forming enzyme in organs in resting condition and in several pathological situations whereas angiotensin I-converting enzyme/kininase II (ACE) is the main kinin-inactivating enzyme in the circulation. Both ACE and K1 activity levels are genetic traits in man. Recent research based mainly on human genetic studies and study of genetically modified mice has documented the physiological role of K1 in the circulation, and also refined understanding of the role of ACE. Kallikrein-K1 is synthesized in arteries and involved in flow-induced vasodilatation. Endothelial ACE synthesis displays strong vessel and organ specificity modulating bioavailability of angiotensins and kinins locally. In pathological situations resulting from hemodynamic, ischemic, or metabolic insult to the cardiovascular system and the kidney K1 and kinins exert critical end-organ protective action and K1 deficiency results in severe worsening of the conditions, at least in the mouse. On the opposite, genetically high ACE level is associated with increased risk of developing ischemic and diabetic cardiac or renal diseases and worsened prognosis of these diseases. The association has been well-documented clinically while causality was established by ACE gene titration in mice. Studies suggest that reduced bioavailability of kinins is prominently involved in the detrimental effect of K1 deficiency or high ACE activity in diseases. Kinins are involved in the therapeutic effect of both ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II AT1 receptor blockers. Based on these findings, a new therapeutic hypothesis focused on selective pharmacological activation of kinin receptors has been launched. Proof of concept was obtained by using prototypic agonists in experimental ischemic and diabetic diseases in mice.",1

31313401,"Gastrin signaling mediated through cholecystokinin-2 receptor (CCK2R) and its downstream molecules is altered in pancreatic cancer. CCK2R antagonists, YF476 (netazepide) and JNJ-26070109, were tested systematically for their effect on pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) progression to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in Kras<sup>G12D</sup> mice. After dose selection using wild-type mice, six-week-old p48<sup>Cre/+</sup> -LSL-Kras<sup>G12D</sup> (22-24 per group) genetically engineered mice (GEM) were fed AIN-76A diets containing 0, 250, or 500 ppm JNJ-26070109 or YF-476 for 38 weeks. At termination, pancreata were collected, weighed, and evaluated for PanINs and PDAC. Results demonstrated that control-diet-fed mice showed 69% (males) and 33% (females) incidence of PDAC. Administration of low and high dose JNJ-26070109 inhibited the incidence of PDAC by 88% and 71% (P < .004) in male mice and by 100% and 24% (P > .05) in female mice, respectively. Low and high dose YF476 inhibited the incidence of PDAC by 74% (P < .02) and 69% (P < .02) in male mice and by 45% and 33% (P > .05) in female mice, respectively. Further, transcriptome analysis showed downregulation of Cldn1, Sstr1, Apod, Gkn1, Siglech, Cyp2c44, Bnc1, Fmo2, 623169, Kcne4, Slc27a6, Cma1, Rho GTPase activating protein 18, and Gpr85 genes in JNJ-26070109-treated mice compared with untreated mice. YF476-treated mouse pancreas showed downregulation of Riks, Zpbp, Ntf3, Lrrn4, Aass, Skint3, Kcnb1, Dgkb, Ddx60, and Aspn gene expressions compared with untreated mouse pancreas. Overall, JNJ-26070109 showed better chemopreventive efficacy than YF476. However, caution is recommended when selecting doses, as the agents appeared to exhibit gender-specific effects.",1
31306022,"Obesity and its related diseases such as cancer and diabetes are leading life-threatening issues in the modern world. Thus, new drugs toward obesity and obesity-caused diseases are highly desired. Human acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (hACC1) in charge of the rate-limiting step of the human fatty acid synthesis was recognized as an attractive target for rational drug design. The fundamental reaction mechanism and nature of the transition state of hACC1 remain unclear. In this study, combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM), molecular dynamics (MD), and free-energy simulations were performed to investigate the catalytic mechanism of the hACC1-catalyzed carboxyl-transfer reaction. Our computational results show a three-step mechanism for carboxyl transferase (CT)-catalyzed reaction, including isomerization of carboxybiotin, proton-transfer from acetyl-CoA to carboxybiotin, and carboxylation of acetyl-CoA enolate. Interestingly, isomerization of carboxybiotin is the rate-limiting step of the entire reaction pathway, indicating hACC1 has the catalytic effect of isomerization and thus might be an isomerase also. The activation free-energy barrier of carboxyl-transfer catalyzed by hACC1 was calculated to be 16.4 kcal/mol, in excellent agreement with the experimental result (16.7 kcal/mol). The obtained reaction mechanism together with the nature of the transition state provides helpful knowledge not only for future investigation of other ACCs but also for rational design of hACC1 inhibitors, such as TS analogue. The catalytic effect of hACC1 isomerization is discussed.",1
31305438,"Given the high risk and lengthy procedure of traditional drug development, drug repurposing is gaining more and more attention. Although many types of drug information have been used to repurpose drugs, drug-drug interaction data, which imply possible physiological effects or targets of drugs, remain unexploited. In this work, similarity of drug interaction was employed to infer similarity of the physiological effects or targets for the drugs. We collected 10,835 drug-drug interactions concerning 1074 drugs, and for 700 of them, drug similarity scores based on drug interaction profiles were computed and rendered using a drug association network with 589 nodes (drugs) and 2375 edges (drug similarity scores). The 589 drugs were clustered into 98 groups with Markov Clustering Algorithm, most of which were significantly correlated with certain drug functions. This indicates that the network can be used to infer the physiological effects of drugs. Furthermore, we evaluated the ability of this drug association network to predict drug targets. The results show that the method is effective for 317 of 561 drugs that have known targets. Comparison of this method with the structure-based approach shows that they are complementary. In summary, this study demonstrates the feasibility of drug repurposing based on drug-drug interaction data.",0
31238693,"A coupled microbial fuel cell (MFC) system, consisting of a nitrifying sulfide removal MFC and a denitrifying sulfide removal MFC, was assembled to simultaneously treat ammonium and sulfide in wastewater. It provided a promising approach to recover electricity from wastewater containing sulfide and ammonium. Considering both substrate removal and electricity generation performance, the desirable feeding S/N molar ratio was deemed as 3 and the optimal temperature was found to be 30 °C. Under this condition, the coupled MFC achieved a sum coulomb production of 554.8 C/d, a total nitrogen removal efficiency of 58.7 ± 1.3% and a sulfur production percent of 27.4 ± 0.4-33.3 ± 0.9%. The introduction of nitrifiers and electroactive oxic microbes from the oxic-cathode chamber into the anoxic-cathode chamber favored nitrogen removal.",0
31236626,"'A disintegrin and metalloproteases' (ADAMs) are a family of transmembrane proteins with diverse functions in multicellular organisms. About half of the ADAMs are active metalloproteases and cleave numerous cell surface proteins, including growth factors, receptors, cytokines and cell adhesion proteins. The other ADAMs have no catalytic activity and function as adhesion proteins or receptors. Some ADAMs are ubiquitously expressed, others are expressed tissue specifically. This review highlights functions of ADAMs in the mammalian nervous system, including their links to diseases. The non-proteolytic ADAM11, ADAM22 and ADAM23 have key functions in neural development, myelination and synaptic transmission and are linked to epilepsy. Among the proteolytic ADAMs, ADAM10 is the best characterized one due to its substrates Notch and amyloid precursor protein, where cleavage is required for nervous system development or linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), respectively. Recent work demonstrates that ADAM10 has additional substrates and functions in the nervous system and its substrate selectivity may be regulated by tetraspanins. New roles for other proteolytic ADAMs in the nervous system are also emerging. For example, ADAM8 and ADAM17 are involved in neuroinflammation. ADAM17 additionally regulates neurite outgrowth and myelination and its activity is controlled by iRhoms. ADAM19 and ADAM21 function in regenerative processes upon neuronal injury. Several ADAMs, including ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM15 and ADAM30, are potential drug targets for AD. Taken together, this review summarizes recent progress concerning substrates and functions of ADAMs in the nervous system and their use as drug targets for neurological and psychiatric diseases.",1
31196017,"Polymer-based electronics with low bending stiffnesses and high flexibility, including recently reported macroporous syringe-injectable mesh electronics, have shown substantial promise for chronic studies of neural circuitry in the brains of live animals. A central challenge for exploiting these highly flexible materials for in vivo studies has centered on the development of efficient input/output (I/O) connections to an external interface with high yield, low bonding resistance, and long-term stability. Here we report a new paradigm applied to the challenging case of injectable mesh electronics that exploits the high flexibility of nanoscale thickness two-sided metal I/O pads that can deform and contact standard interface cables in high yield with long-term electrical stability. First, we describe the design and facile fabrication of two-sided metal I/O pads that allow for contact without regard to probe orientation. Second, systematic studies of the contact resistance as a function of I/O pad design and mechanical properties demonstrate the key role of the I/O pad bending stiffness in achieving low-resistance stable contacts. Additionally, computational studies provide design rules for achieving high-yield multiplexed contact interfacing in the case of angular misalignment such that adjacent channels are not shorted. Third, the in vitro measurement of 32-channel mesh electronics probes bonded to interface cables using the direct contact method shows a reproducibly high yield of electrical connectivity. Finally, in vivo experiments with 32-channel mesh electronics probes implanted in live mice demonstrate the chronic stability of the direct contact interface, enabling consistent tracking of single-unit neural activity over at least 2 months without a loss of channel recording. The direct contact interfacing methodology paves the way for scalable long-term connections of multiplexed mesh electronics neural probes for neural recording and modulation and moreover could be used to facilitate a scalable interconnection of other flexible electronics in biological studies and therapeutic applications.",0
31189030,"RUNX2 is a transcription factor critical for chondrocyte maturation and normal endochondral bone formation. It promotes the expression of factors catabolic to the cartilage extracellular matrix and is upregulated in human osteoarthritic cartilage and in murine articular cartilage following joint injury. To date, in vivo studies of RUNX2 overexpression in cartilage have been limited to forced expression in osteochondroprogenitor cells preventing investigation into the effects of chondrocyte-specific RUNX2 overexpression in postnatal articular cartilage. Here, we used the Rosa26<sup>Runx2</sup> allele in combination with the inducible Col2a1<sup>CreERT2</sup> transgene or the inducible Acan<sup>CreERT2</sup> knock-in allele to achieve chondrocyte-specific RUNX2 overexpression (OE) during embryonic development or in the articular cartilage of adult mice, respectively. RUNX2 OE was induced at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) for all developmental studies. Histology and in situ hybridization analyses suggest an early onset of chondrocyte hypertrophy and accelerated terminal maturation in the limbs of the RUNX2 OE embryos compared to control embryos. For all postnatal studies, RUNX2 OE was induced at 2 months of age. Surprisingly, no histopathological signs of cartilage degeneration were observed even 6 months following induction of RUNX2 OE. Using the meniscal/ligamentous injury (MLI), a surgical model of knee joint destabilization and meniscal injury, however, we found that RUNX2 OE accelerates the progression of cartilage degeneration following joint trauma. One month following MLI, the numbers of MMP13-positive and TUNEL-positive chondrocytes were significantly greater in the articular cartilage of the RUNX2 OE joints compared to control joints and 2 months following MLI, histomorphometry and Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scoring revealed decreased cartilage area in the RUNX2 OE joints. Collectively, these results suggest that although RUNX2 overexpression alone may not be sufficient to initiate the OA degenerative process, it may predetermine the rate of OA onset and/or progression following traumatic joint injury. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",1
31181191,"Low phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis (LPAC) is characterized by the association of ABCB4 mutations and low biliary phospholipid concentration with symptomatic and recurring cholelithiasis. In the present study, we reported a case of a 63-year-old woman, who presented a biliary pain beginning at the age of 30, recurrent after cholecystectomy, along with ""comet-tail shadows"" revealed by ultrasonography thus, fulfilling the diagnosis of LPAC. This disease evolved into a cholangiocarcinoma. To understand the molecular basis of this phenotype, we performed the ABCB4 gene sequencing, followed by in silico analysis and Q-RT-PCR assay. The results displayed a homozygous missense sequence variation (c.140G > A, p.Arg47Gln), predicted as pathogenic according to MutPred. Accordingly, this gave rise to a decreased hepatic ABCB4 mRNA level and structural alterations of the mutated protein. Eventually, we reported, here, the first description of an ABCB4 missense mutation (p.Arg47Gln) at homozygous state in a Tunisian LPAC syndrome. An elucidation of its functional consequences was performed. Besides, this case suggests that the delayed diagnosis of LPAC syndrome and the lack of UDCA treatment may contribute in the development of complications, such as cholangiocarcinoma.",1
31166044,"Phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase III β (PI4KB) is a host factor that is required for enterovirus (EV) replication. In this study, the importance of host proteins that interact with PI4KB in EV replication was analyzed by trans complementation with PI4KB mutants in a PI4KB-knockout cell line. Ectopically expressed PI4KB mutants, which lack binding regions for ACBD3, RAB11, and 14-3-3 proteins, rescued replication of poliovirus and enterovirus 71. These findings suggest that interaction of PI4KB with these host proteins is not essential for EV replication once PI4KB has been expressed and that PI4KB is functionally independent from these host proteins regarding EV replication.",0

Based on evidence from the literature, the atheroprotective association with carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1 could be mediated by the strong genetic effect of this locus on increased circulating glycine levels. Methods and Results We sought to identify additional genetic determinants of circulating glycine levels by carrying out a meta-analysis of genome-wide association study data in up to 30 118 subjects of European ancestry. Mendelian randomization and other analytical approaches were used to determine whether glycine-associated variants were associated with CAD and traditional risk factors. Twelve loci were significantly associated with circulating glycine levels, 7 of which were not previously known to be involved in glycine metabolism ( ACADM , PHGDH , COX 18- ADAMTS 3, PSPH , TRIB 1, PTPRD , and ABO ). Glycine-raising alleles at several loci individually exhibited directionally consistent associations with decreased risk of CAD . However, these effects could not be attributed directly to glycine because of associations with other CAD -related traits. By comparison, genetic models that only included the 2 variants directly involved in glycine degradation and for which there were no other pleiotropic associations were not associated with risk of CAD or blood pressure, lipid levels, and obesity-related traits. Conclusions These results provide additional insight into the genetic architecture of glycine metabolism, but do not yield conclusive evidence for a causal relationship between circulating levels of this amino acid and risk of CAD in humans.",1
31069014,"Since the advent of cetuximab, clinical cancer treatment has evolved from the standard, relatively nonspecific chemo- and radiotherapy with significant cytotoxic side effects towards immunotherapeutic approaches with selective, target-mechanism-based effects. Antibody therapies as the most successful form of cancer immunotherapy led to approved treatments for specific cancer types with increased patient survival. Thus, the identification of tumor antigens with high immunogenicity is in central focus now. In this study, we applied computational methods to comprehensively discover overexpressed molecular targets with high therapeutic relevance for clinical, immunotherapeutic cancer treatment in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). By actively modeling potential negative side effects utilizing expression data of 29 different, normal human tissues, we were able to develop a highly-specific coverage of TNBC patients with RNA targets. We identified here more than 400 potential tumor-specific antigens suitable for targeted therapy, including several already identified as potential targets for TNBC and other solid tumors. A specific cocktail of MAGEB4, CT83, TLX3, ACTL8, PRDM13 achieved almost 94% patient coverage in TNBC. Overall, these results show that our approach can identify and prioritize TNBC targets suitable for targeted therapy. Therefore, our method has the potential to lead to new and more effective immunotherapeutic cancer treatment.",1
31031012,"We identified individuals with variations in ACTL6B, a component of the chromatin remodeling machinery including the BAF complex. Ten individuals harbored bi-allelic mutations and presented with global developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, and spasticity, and ten individuals with de novo heterozygous mutations displayed intellectual disability, ambulation deficits, severe language impairment, hypotonia, Rett-like stereotypies, and minor facial dysmorphisms (wide mouth, diastema, bulbous nose). Nine of these ten unrelated individuals had the identical de novo c.1027G>A (p.Gly343Arg) mutation. Human-derived neurons were generated that recaptured ACTL6B expression patterns in development from progenitor cell to post-mitotic neuron, validating the use of this model. Engineered knock-out of ACTL6B in wild-type human neurons resulted in profound deficits in dendrite development, a result recapitulated in two individuals with different bi-allelic mutations, and reversed on clonal genetic repair or exogenous expression of ACTL6B. Whole-transcriptome analyses and whole-genomic profiling of the BAF complex in wild-type and bi-allelic mutant ACTL6B neural progenitor cells and neurons revealed increased genomic binding of the BAF complex in ACTL6B mutants, with corresponding transcriptional changes in several genes including TPPP and FSCN1, suggesting that altered regulation of some cytoskeletal genes contribute to altered dendrite development. Assessment of bi-alleic and heterozygous ACTL6B mutations on an ACTL6B knock-out human background demonstrated that bi-allelic mutations mimic engineered deletion deficits while heterozygous mutations do not, suggesting that the former are loss of function and the latter are gain of function. These results reveal a role for ACTL6B in neurodevelopment and implicate another component of chromatin remodeling machinery in brain disease.",1
31028847,"Exomes of 27 Russian subjects were analyzed for the presence of medically relevant alleles, such as protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in known recessive disease-associated genes and pathogenic missense mutations included in the ClinVar database. 36 variants (24 PTVs and 12 amino acid substitutions) were identified and then subjected to the analysis in 897 population controls. 9/36 mutations were novel, however only two of them (POLH c.490delG associated with xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV) and CATSPER1 c.859_860delCA responsible for spermatogenic failure) were shown to be recurrent. 27 out of 36 pathogenic alleles were already described in prior genetic studies; seven of them occurred only in the index cases, while 20 demonstrated evidence for persistence in Russian population. In particular, non-random occurrence was revealed for SERPINA1 c.1096G > A (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency), C8B c.1282C > T and c.1653G > A (complement component 8B deficiency), ATP7B c.3207C > A (Wilson disease), PROP1 c.301_302delAG (combined pituitary hormone deficiency), CYP21A2 c.844G > T (non-classical form of adrenogenital syndrome), EYS c.1155T > A (retinitis pigmentosa), HADHA c.1528G > C (LCHAD deficiency), SCO2 c.418G > A (cytochrome c oxidase deficiency), OTOA c.2359G > T (sensorineural deafness), C2 c.839_866del (complement component 2 deficiency), ACADVL c.848T > C (VLCAD deficiency), TGM5 c.337G > T (acral peeling skin syndrome) and VWF c.2561 G > A (von Willebrand disease, type 2N).

31016187,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of phosphorylatable nucleus localization signal linked nucleic kinase substrate short peptide (<sup>p</sup>NNS)-conjugated chitosan (<sup>p</sup>NNS-CS) mediated miR-140 and IGF-1 in both rabbit chondrocytes and cartilage defects model. <sup>p</sup>NNS-CS was combined with pBudCE4.1-IGF-1, pBudCE4.1-miR-140, and negative control pBudCE4.1 to form pDNA/<sup>p</sup>NNS-CS complexes. Then these complexes were transfected into chondrocytes or injected intra-articularly into the knee joints. High levels of IGF-1 and miR-140 expression were detected both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Compared with pBudCE4.1 group, <i>in vitro</i>, the transgenic groups significantly promoted chondrocyte proliferation, increased glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis, and ACAN, COL2A1, and TIMP-1 levels, and reduced the levels of nitric oxide (NO), MMP-13, and ADAMTS-5. <i>In vivo</i>, the exogenous genes enhanced COL2A1, ACAN, and TIMP-1 expression in cartilage and reduced cartilage Mankin score and the contents of NO, IL-1<i>β</i>, TNF-<i>α</i>, and GAG contents in synovial fluid of rabbits, MMP-13, ADAMTS-5, COL1A2, and COL10A1 levels in cartilage.

31004931,"Mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) is a major bioactive metabolite in the widely used industrial plasticizer diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) that has been found to be toxic to the liver. The aim of this study is to determine whether MEHP exposure can change the expression of fatty acid metabolism-related genes in HepG2 cells, which might be related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The results revealed that exposure to MEHP promoted lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. The levels of intracellular triglycerides in the hepatocytes increased after exposure to 0.8-100 μM MEHP for 24 h and 48 h. The genetic expressions of SREBP-1c, ChREBP, ACC1, FASN, and SCD significantly increased at 6 h after exposure to MEHP. At 24 h, the expression of the SREBP-1c and ChREBP genes remained increased, while the expression of the FASN and SCD genes decreased. At 48 h, the expression of SREBP-1c, ChREBP, ACC1, FASN, and SCD decreased. Furthermore, the levels of proteins including ACC1, FASN, SCD, and ChREBP (except SREBP-1c) increased at 24 h. These findings suggest that MEHP exposure can promote fatty acid synthesis in hepatocytes by regulating the expression of relevant genes and proteins, contributing to NAFLD.",1
31001955,"Endogenous peptides, in the form of cytokines, growth hormones and hormone peptides, play an important role in human hormones, nerves, cell growth and reproduction. Neuropeptide is a kind of endogenous peptide, which is related to the physiological activities of pain, sleep, emotion, learning and memory. Neuropeptides exist not only in the nerve cells of the brain, but also in other body fluids and organs. At present, there is still a lack of research on endogenous peptides, especially on neuropeptides. In this study, high-throughput liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify the distribution of endogenous peptides in the pancreas, heart, liver and kidney as well as the types of neuropeptides. The results showed that the number of endogenous peptides and neuropeptides in the liver was the highest while that of the pancreas was the lowest. The identified endogenous peptides were organ-specific and presented different dynamic distribution in four kinds of organs. The number of LPV (Longest peptide variant) of neuropeptide in the four organs varies greatly, and the distribution of gene family is also different. For example, neuropeptide in pancreas belongs to Glucagon family, while neuropeptide in heart belongs to ACBD7, Granins, PEBP and other families. The identification results will provide reference value for the mechanism study of diseases and the research and development of therapeutic drugs.",1
30977450,"Neurodegeneration is a distinguishing feature of many age related disorders and other vector borne neuroinflammatory diseases. There are a number of factors that can modulate the pathology of these disorders. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are primarily involved in the maintenance of normal brain homeostasis by eliminating toxic peptides and compounds from the brain. Also, ABC transporters protect the brain from the unwanted effects of endogenous and exogenous toxins that can enter the brain parenchyma. Therefore, these transporters have the ability to determine the pathological outcomes of several neurological disorders. For instance, ABC transporters like P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), and BCRP (ABCG2) have been reported to facilitate the clearance of peptides such as amyloid-β (Aβ) that accumulate in the brain during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Other members such as ABCA1, ABCA2, ABCC8, ABCC9, ABCG1 and ABCG4 also have been reported to be involved in the progression of various brain disorders such as HIV-associated dementia, Multiple sclerosis (MS), Ischemic stroke, Japanese encephalitis (JE) and Epilepsy. However, these defective transporters can be targeted by numerous botanical compounds such as Verapamil, Berberine and Fascalpsyn as a therapeutic target to treat these neurological outcomes. These compounds are already reported to modulate ABC transporter activity in the CNS. Nonetheless, the exact mechanisms involving the ABC transporters role in normal brain functioning, their role in neuronal dysfunction and how these botanical compounds ensure and facilitate their therapeutic action in association with defective transporters still remain elusive. This review therefore, summarizes the role of ABC transporters in neurological disorders, with a special emphasis on its role in AD brains. The prospect of using botanical/natural compounds as modulators of ABC transporters in neurological disorders is discussed in the latter half of the article.",1
30974196,"Usher syndrome (USH) is a clinically common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and sensorineural hearing loss with or without vestibular dysfunction. In this study, we identified a Hunan family of Chinese descent with two affected members clinically diagnosed with Usher syndrome type 3 (USH3) displaying hearing, visual acuity, and olfactory decline. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a nonsense variant in ABHD12 gene that was confirmed to be segregated in this family by Sanger sequencing and exhibited a recessive inheritance pattern. In this family, two patients carried homozygous variant in the ABHD12 (NM_015600: c.249C>G). Mutation of ABHD12, an enzyme that hydrolyzes an endocannabinoid lipid transmitter, caused incomplete PHARC syndrome, as demonstrated in previous reports. Therefore, we also conducted a summary based on variants in ABHD12 in PHARC patients, and in PHARC patients showing that there was no obvious correlation between the genotype and phenotype. We believe that this should be considered during the differential diagnosis of USH. Our findings predicted the potential function of this gene in the development of hearing and vision loss, particularly with regard to impaired signal transmission, and identified a novel nonsense variant to expand the variant spectrum in ABHD12.",1

Identification of a gene expression profile in tumours that selects a subpopulation of patients that is more likely to develop visceral organ metastases will help elucidate mechanisms for the development of distant metastases and could be of clinical value. With this study we aimed to determine genomic predictors that would help to distinguish breast cancer patients with more likelihood to develop visceral metastasis.",1
30928426,"DARC is thought to act as a key invasion receptor in P. vivax malaria. It is known that the expression of DARC and susceptibility to P. vivax malaria is influenced by the presence of specific DARC genotypes. Studies have reported the low probability of P. vivax malaria in individuals carrying FyA allele due to the significantly reduced binding of the P. vivax duffy binding protein. No association of the allele frequency and severe vivax malaria epidemiology has been yet established in our country. In the present study, a high level of heterozygotes was observed with a statistically significant deviation from the H-W equilibrium in the group with complicated malaria; which is indicative of demographic disequilibrium. Significantly upregulated expression of the DARC receptor in FyA/FyB heterozygote patients is suggestive of a greater receptor repertoire responsible for the possible variation in the parasite ligand binding with the host receptor and thus might have a role to play in severe malaria.",1
30922315,"Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) typically have normal or even elevated plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations; however, HDL protein composition can be altered without a change in cholesterol content. Alteration of the HDL proteome can result in dysfunctional HDL particles with reduced ability to protect against cardiovascular disease (CVD).

30919179,"Plants can communicate with other plants using wireless pathways in the plant-wide web. Some examples of these communication pathways are: (1) volatile organic compounds' emission and sensing; (2) mycorrhizal networks in the soil; (3) the plants' rhizosphere; (4) naturally grafting of roots of the same species; (5) electrostatic or electromagnetic interactions; and (6) acoustic communication. There is an additional pathway for electrical signal transmission between plants - electrical signal transmission between roots through the soil. To avoid the possibility of communication between plants using mechanisms (1)-(6), soils in pots with plants were connected by Ag/AgCl or platinum wires. Electrostimulation of Aloe vera, tomato, or cabbage plants induces electrotonic potentials transmission in the electro-stimulated plants as well as the plants located in different pots regardless if plants are the same or different types. The amplitude and sign of electrotonic potentials in electrostimulated and neighboring plants depend on the amplitude, rise, and fall of the applied voltage. Experimental results displayed cell-to-cell electrical coupling and the existence of electrical differentiators in plants. Electrostimulation by a sinusoidal wave induces an electrical response with a phase shift. Electrostimulation serves as an important tool for the evaluation of mechanisms of communication in the plant-wide web.",0
30905672,"Rab35, a master regulator of membrane trafficking, regulates diverse cellular processes and is associated with various human diseases. Although a number of effectors have been identified, the molecular basis of Rab35-effector interactions remains unclear. Here, we provide the high-resolution crystal structures of Rab35 in complex with its two specific effectors ACAP2 and RUSC2, respectively. In the Rab35/ACAP2 complex structure, Rab35 binds to the terminal ankyrin repeat and a C-terminal extended α helix of ACAP2, revealing a previously uncharacterized binding mode both for Rabs and ankyrin repeats. In the Rab35/RUSC2 complex structure, Arg1015 of RUSC2 functions as a ""pseudo-arginine finger"" that stabilizes the GTP-bound Rab35, thus facilitating the assembly of Rab35/RUSC2 complex. The structural analysis allows us to design specific Rab35 mutants capable of eliminating Rab35/ACAP2 and Rab35/RUSC2 interactions, but not interfering with other effector bindings. The atomic structures also offer possible explanations to disease-associated mutants identified at the Rab35-effector interfaces.",1
30903345,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) originally identified ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 7 (ABCA7), as a novel risk gene of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since then, accumulating evidence from in vitro, in vivo, and human-based studies has corroborated and extended this association, promoting ABCA7 as one of the most important risk genes of both early-onset and late-onset AD, harboring both common and rare risk variants with relatively large effect on AD risk. Within this review, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the literature on ABCA7, with a focus on AD-related human -omics studies (e.g. genomics, transcriptomics, and methylomics). In European and African American populations, indirect ABCA7 GWAS associations are explained by expansion of an ABCA7 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR), and a common premature termination codon (PTC) variant, respectively. Rare ABCA7 PTC variants are strongly enriched in AD patients, and some of these have displayed inheritance patterns resembling autosomal dominant AD. In addition, rare missense variants are more frequent in AD patients than healthy controls, whereas a common ABCA7 missense variant may protect from disease. Methylation at several CpG sites in the ABCA7 locus is significantly associated with AD. Furthermore, ABCA7 contains many different isoforms and ABCA7 splicing has been shown to associate with AD. Besides associations with disease status, these genetic and epigenetic ABCA7 markers also showed significant correlations with AD endophenotypes; in particular amyloid deposition and brain morphology. In conclusion, human-based -omics studies provide converging evidence of (partial) ABCA7 loss as an AD pathomechanism, and future studies should make clear if interventions on ABCA7 expression can serve as a valuable therapeutic target for AD.",1
30894546,"The corneal endothelium is vital for transparency and proper hydration of the cornea. Here, we conduct a genome-wide association study of corneal endothelial cell density (cells/mm<sup>2</sup>), coefficient of cell size variation (CV), percentage of hexagonal cells (HEX) and central corneal thickness (CCT) in 6,125 Icelanders and find associations at 10 loci, including 7 novel. We assess the effects of these variants on various ocular biomechanics such as corneal hysteresis (CH), as well as eye diseases such as glaucoma and corneal dystrophies. Most notably, an intergenic variant close to ANAPC1 (rs78658973[A], frequency = 28.3%) strongly associates with decreased cell density and accounts for 24% of the population variance in cell density (β = -0.77 SD, P = 1.8 × 10<sup>-314</sup>) and associates with increased CH (β = 0.19 SD, P = 2.6 × 10<sup>-19</sup>) without affecting risk of corneal diseases and glaucoma. Our findings indicate that despite correlations between cell density and eye diseases, low cell density does not increase the risk of disease.",1
30890428,"Melatonin, a neuroendocrine hormone synthesized by the pineal gland and cholangiocytes, decreases biliary hyperplasia and liver fibrosis during cholestasis-induced biliary injury via melatonin-dependent autocrine signaling through increased biliary arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) expression and melatonin secretion, downregulation of miR-200b and specific circadian clock genes. Melatonin synthesis is decreased by pinealectomy (PINX) or chronic exposure to light. We evaluated the effect of PINX or prolonged light exposure on melatonin-dependent modulation of biliary damage/ductular reaction/liver fibrosis. Studies were performed in male rats with/without BDL for 1 week with 12:12 h dark/light cycles, continuous light or after 1 week of PINX. The expression of AANAT and melatonin levels in serum and cholangiocyte supernatant were increased in BDL rats, while decreased in BDL rats following PINX or continuous light exposure. BDL-induced increase in serum chemistry, ductular reaction, liver fibrosis, inflammation, angiogenesis and ROS generation were significantly enhanced by PINX or light exposure. Concomitant with enhanced liver fibrosis, we observed increased biliary senescence and enhanced clock genes and miR-200b expression in total liver and cholangiocytes. In vitro, the expression of AANAT, clock genes and miR-200b was increased in PSC human cholangiocyte cell lines (hPSCL). The proliferation and activation of HHStecs (human hepatic stellate cell lines) were increased after stimulating with BDL cholangiocyte supernatant and further enhanced when stimulated with BDL rats following PINX or continuous light exposure cholangiocyte supernatant via intracellular ROS generation. Conclusion: Melatonin plays an important role in the protection of liver against cholestasis-induced damage and ductular reaction.",1
30877531,"A biocathode microbial fuel cell was constructed to investigate Congo red decolorization and power generation under different cathode operational parameters. The results showed that the suspended sludge in the cathode could improve the performance of the microbial fuel cell for electricity generation but had a negligible effect on the Congo red decolorization. The maximum voltage increased as the aeration rate was increased up to 100 mL/min. At aeration rates of 150 and 200 mL/min, the maximum voltage was lower than that at 100 mL/min. In the meantime, the Congo red decolorization efficiency decreased with increasing cathode aeration rate. These results showed that excessive aeration is not favorable in a bio-cathode microbial fuel cell used for simultaneous Congo red decolorization and electricity generation. The addition of Mn<sup>2+</sup> to the biocathode resulted in a 74.5% increase in maximum power density but had no effect on Congo red decolorization. SEM and 16S rRNA sequencing analysis confirmed that Mn<sup>2+</sup> was involved in the electrochemical reaction of the biocathode as an electron mediator, and it could induce a difference in the biocathode-attached populations.",0
30877375,"Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) refers to a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of inherited disorders affecting the structure, composition, and quantity of tooth enamel. Both non-syndromic and syndromic forms of AI have been described and several genes affecting various aspects of the enamel physiology have been reported. Genetically modified murine models of various genes have provided insights into the complex regulation of proper amelogenesis. Non-syndromic AI occurs spontaneously also in dogs with known recessive variants in ENAM and SLC24A4 genes. Unlike rodents with a reduced dentition and continuously erupting incisors, canine models are valuable for human AI due to similarity in the dental anatomy including deciduous and permanent teeth. We have performed a series of clinical and genetic analyses to investigate AI in several breeds of dogs and describe here two novel recessive variants in the ENAM and ACP4 genes. A fully segregating missense variant (c.716C>T) in exon 8 of ENAM substitutes a well-conserved proline to leucine, p.(Pro239Leu), resulting in a clinical hypomineralization of teeth. A 1-bp insertion in ACP4 (c.1189dupG) is predicted to lead to a frameshift, p.(Ala397Glyfs), resulting in an abnormal C-terminal part of the protein, and hypoplastic AI. The ENAM variant was specific for Parson Russell Terriers with a carrier frequency of 9%. The ACP4 variant was found in two breeds, Akita and American Akita with a carrier frequency of 22%. These genetic findings establish novel canine models of human AI with a particular interest in the case of the ACP4-deficient model, since ACP4 physiology is poorly characterized in human AI. The affected dogs could also serve as preclinical models for novel treatments while the breeds would benefit from genetic tests devised here for veterinary diagnostics and breeding programs.",1
30871035,"The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing worldwide, concurrent with increased obesity. Thus, there is urgent need for research that can lead to effective NAFLD prevention/treatment strategies. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), improve inflammation- and dyslipidemia-related metabolic disorders; however, mechanisms mediating the benefits of n-3 PUFAs in NAFLD treatment are less understood. We previously reported that EPA reversed obesity-induced hepatic steatosis in high-fat (HF)-fed B6 mice. Utilizing a combination of biochemical analyses of liver tissues from HF and HF-EPA-fed mice and a series of in vitro studies in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-stimulated HepG2 cells, we dissect the mechanistic effects of EPA in reducing hepatic steatosis, including the role of EPA-targeted microRNAs (miRNA). With EPA, hepatic lipid metabolism was improved in HF-EPA mice, as indicated by decreased protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (<i>Acaca</i>) gene, and increased mRNA levels for the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (<i>Pparα</i>), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (<i>Cpt</i>) 1a and 2 genes in the HF-EPA mice. Additionally, inflammation was reduced, as shown by decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha (<i>Tnfα</i>) gene expression. Accordingly, EPA also significantly reduced <i>FASN</i> and <i>ACACA</i> mRNAs in human HepG2 cells. Glycolysis, estimated by extracellular acidification rate, was significantly reduced in HepG2 cells treated with EPA vs. vehicle. Furthermore, we identified several miRNAs that are regulated by EPA in mouse liver, including miR-19b-3p, miR-21a-5p, and others, which target lipid metabolism and inflammatory pathways. In conclusion, our findings provide novel mechanistic evidence for beneficial effects of EPA in NAFLD, through the identification of specific genes and miRNAs, which may be further exploited as future NAFLD therapies.",1
30868878,"Osmotic microbial fuel cell (OsMFC) is an emerging biotechnology that integrates forward osmosis (FO) membrane into microbial fuel cells. Selection of an appropriate draw solute (DS) could affect both water extraction and electricity generation. Herein, we have investigated a promising DS - EDTA-Na<sub>2</sub>, a widely used chelating agent. The OsMFC with the EDTA DS achieved 779.6 ± 18.5C (electricity production) and 1.22 ± 0.02 LMH (water flux), both of which were comparable to that with the NaCl DS at the same conductivity. However, the EDTA DS resulted in a significantly lower reverse solute flux (RSF) of 0.36 ± 0.08 gMH and a lower catholyte pH that could ensure healthy operation of the tested FO membrane. The OsMFC with the EDTA DS exhibited a positive forward flux for Na<sup>+</sup> ions, likely related to the effect of EDTA-Na complexion. Due to the lumping effects of EDTA dissociation equilibrium and membrane surface chemistry, a higher catholyte pH led to a higher water flux and reduced RSF, but lower electricity production. The cyclic voltammetry tests revealed that the reverse-fluxed EDTA species might have chelated Fe<sup>II/III</sup> redox coupled to facilitate electron transfer on the anode surface, but the EDTA DS in the cathode could interfere with the cathodic reaction through assisting in metal wires oxidation. In the reuse test, >90% of EDTA DS could be recovered and then successfully reused in the subsequent OsMFC operation. The results of this study would encourage further exploration of using EDTA-based compounds as a draw solute for OsMFC applications.",0
30830667,"The scope of this study is to analyze the carbon emissions intensity of electricity generation in ""Belt and Road Initiative"" (BRI) countries. The total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from electricity generation in BRI nations increases from 4232.34 Mt in 2013 to 4402.38 Mt in 2015, accounting for 34.45% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from electricity generation. Logarithmic mean Divisia index methodology is applied to analyze the drivers of carbon emissions intensity in BRI nations. The decomposition results revealed that the regional carbon emissions intensity in BRI nations increases during 2013-2015 and the power generation efficiency is the essential factor to improve carbon emissions performance in BRI developing countries. For BRI developing countries, promoting clean and efficient thermal power is a pragmatic priority for green power development.",0
30817674,"This study attempts to investigate the relationship among electricity consumption, economic growth, and employment in China. Distinct from most of the previous studies, our empirical research identifies a long-run equilibrium cointegration relationship among the three covariates during the period of 1971-2009 with the recently developed autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach. The parameters are estimated through a long-run static solution of the estimated ARDL model and short-run dynamic solutions of the error correction model. The estimated models successfully pass diagnostic tests and both the long-run and short-run elasticities are found to be statistically significant. The study also indicates the existence of short-run and long-run causalities from electricity consumption and employment to economic growth. Results of this study show that electricity serves as an important driver of economic growth. Based on these results, several policy prescriptions on energy use and economic development are suggested for China.",0
30810905,"Using publically available datasets on gene expression in medulloblastoma (MB) subtypes, we selected genes for ubiquitin ligases and identified statistically those that best predicted each of the four major MB subgroups as separate disease entities. We identify a gene coding for an ubiquitin ligase, ZNRF3, whose overexpression alone can predict the WNT subgroup for 100% in the Pfister dataset. For the SHH subgroup, we identify a gene for a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), PPP2R2C, as the major predictor among the E3 ligases genes. The ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like conjugation database (UUCD) lists PPP2R2C as coding for a Cullin Ring ubiquitin ligase adaptor. For group 3 MBs, the best ubiquitin ligase predictor was PPP2R2B, a gene which codes for another regulatory subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme. For group 4, the best E3 gene predictors were MID2, ZBTB18, and PPP2R2A, which codes for a third PP2A regulatory subunit. Heatmap analysis of the E3 gene data shows that expression of ten genes for ubiquitin ligases can be used to classify MBs into the four major consensus subgroups. This was illustrated by analysis of gene expression of ubiquitin ligases of the Pfister dataset and confirmed in the dataset of Cavalli. We conclude that genes for ubiquitin ligases can be used as genetic markers for MB subtypes and that the proteins coded for by these genes should be investigated as subtype specific therapeutic targets for MB.",1
30786683,"In the present study, we analysed the association of mutations of a BRCA1-associated gene, ABRAXAS1, with the risk of development of breast cancer (BC) in BRCA1-negative women from North-Central Poland. A hundred women with consecutively diagnosed BC and 100 women belonging to the control group were screened for new mutations predisposing to breast cancer. The first step was a test carried out in order to find one of the three Polish founder mutations in the BRCA1 gene. In 96 BRCA1-negative patients two missense variants: c.422C>T and c.1042G>A as well as two intronic variants: IVS3-34G>A, IVS3-44T>C were detected in the ABRAXAS1 gene. The c.422C>T mutation was detected in one of 96 women diagnosed with breast cancer (1.04%); it was not associated with increased risk of disease in this group, compared to the controls (p = 0.49), but the odds ratio was 3.314; 95% CI: 0.122-75.352. IVS3-44T>C was found more frequently in the control group (15/93) than in the tested group (1/85), OR 0.062; 95% CI: 0.008-0.480, p = 0.007, which may suggest protective properties of this variant against tumorigenicity. The data obtained from the present study suggest the necessity for further research to be conducted on the ABRAXAS1 gene in relation to hereditary predisposition to breast cancer.",1
30753418,"We previously showed that the first intron of genes exhibits several interesting characteristics not seen in other introns: 1) it is the longest intron on average in almost all eukaryotes, 2) it presents the highest number of conserved sites, and 3) it exhibits the highest density of regulatory chromatin marks. Here, we expand on our previous study by integrating various multiomics data, leading to further evidence supporting the functionality of sites in the first intron. We first show that trait-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (TASs) are significantly enriched in the first intron. We also show that within the first intron, the density of epigenetic chromatin signals is higher near TASs than in distant regions. Furthermore, the distribution of several chromatin regulatory marks is investigated in relation to gene expression specificity (i.e., housekeeping vs. tissue-specific expression), essentiality (essential genes vs. nonessential genes), and levels of gene expression; housekeeping genes or essential genes contain greater proportions of active chromatin marks than tissue-specific genes or nonessential genes, and highly expressed genes exhibit a greater density of chromatin regulatory marks than genes with low expression. Moreover, we observe that genes carrying multiple first-intron TASs interact with each other within a large protein-protein interaction network, ultimately connecting to the UBC protein, a well-established protein involved in ubiquitination. We believe that our results shed light on the functionality of first introns as a genomic entity involved in gene expression regulation.",0
30740901,"The human skin has inspired multimodal detection using smart devices or systems in fields including biomedical engineering, robotics, and artificial intelligence. Hairs of a high aspect ratio (AR) connected to follicles, in particular, detect subtle structural displacements by airflow or ultralight touch above the skin. Here, hairy skin electronics assembled with an array of graphene sensors (16 pixels) and artificial microhairs for multimodal detection of tactile stimuli and details of airflows (e.g., intensity, direction, and incident angle) are presented. Composed of percolation networks of graphene nanoplatelet sheets, the sensor array can simultaneously detect pressure, temperature, and vibration, all of which correspond to the sensing range of human tactile perceptions with ultrahigh response time (<0.5 ms, 2 kHz) for restoration. The device covered with microhairs (50 μm diameter and 300 μm height, AR = 6, hexagonal layout, and ∼4400/cm<sup>2</sup>) exhibits mapping of electrical signals induced by noncontact airflow and identifying the direction, incident angle, and intensity of wind to the sensor. For potential applications, we implement the hairy electronics to a sailing robot and demonstrate changes in locomotion and speed by detecting the direction and intensity of airflow.",0
30737887,"We report here a novel de novo missense variant affecting the last amino acid of exon 30 of CREBBP [NM_004380, c.5170G>A; p.(Glu1724Lys)] in a 17-year-old boy presenting mild intellectual disability and dysmorphisms but not resembling the phenotype of classical Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. The patient showed a marked overweight from early infancy on and had cortical heterotopias. Recently, 22 individuals have been reported with missense mutations in the last part of exon 30 and the beginning of exon 31 of CREBBP, showing this new phenotype. This additional case further delineates the genotype-phenotype correlations within the molecular and phenotypic spectrum of variants in CREBBP and EP300.",1
30730842,"Background Short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD) deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism with uncertain clinical significance. As it leads to C5-carnitine (i.e. isovalerylcarnitine, 2methylbutyrilcarnitine, or pivaloylcarnitine) elevation, SBCAD deficiency is detectable at newborn screening, requiring differential diagnosis from isovaleric acidemia and pivalic acid administration. Increased urinary excretion of 2-methylbutyrylglycine (2MBG) is the hallmark of SBCAD deficiency. Methods We report two cases of SBCAD deficiency and provide a review of the available literature on this condition. Results Two siblings newly diagnosed with SBCAD deficiency are reported. Newborn screening allowed the early diagnosis in the second-born (C5=0.5 μmol/L, normal 0.05-0.3 μmol/L) and addressed selective screening in the 5-year asymptomatic brother (C5=1.9 μmol/L). Both patients showed increased urinary excretion of 2MBG and two mutations in the ACADSB gene (c.443C>T/c.1145C>T). Currently, both the patients are asymptomatic. Longitudinal biochemical monitoring of the two patients while on treatment with carnitine (100 mg/kg/day) was provided. Based on our experience and the literature review (162 patients), SBCAD deficiency is symptomatic in about 10% of reported patients. Clinical onset occurs in newborns or later in life with seizures, developmental delay, hypotonia, and failure to thrive. On longitudinal follow-up, epilepsy, developmental delay, microcephaly, and autism can develop. Acute metabolic decompensation due to catabolic stressors can occur, as observed in one newly reported patient. Fifteen mutations in the ACADSB gene are known, including the newly identified variant c.1145C>T (p.Thr382Met), variably associated to the phenotype. In the Hmong population, SBCAD deficiency is highly prevalent, mostly due to the founder mutation c.1165A>G, and is largely asymptomatic. Conclusions Although mostly asymptomatic, considering SBCAD deficiency as a non-disease in non-Hmong subjects appears unsafe. Catabolic situations can precipitate acute metabolic decompensation. Carnitine supplementation and valproate avoidance appear to be indicated. Providing an emergency protocol for the management of acute catabolic episodes seems reasonable in asymptomatic patients with SBCAD deficiency. Longitudinal follow-up is recommended.",1
30718454,"Stress is associated with poorer physical and mental health. To improve our understanding of this link, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of depressive symptoms and genome-wide by environment interaction studies (GWEIS) of depressive symptoms and stressful life events (SLE) in two UK population-based cohorts (Generation Scotland and UK Biobank). No SNP was individually significant in either GWAS, but gene-based tests identified six genes associated with depressive symptoms in UK Biobank (DCC, ACSS3, DRD2, STAG1, FOXP2 and KYNU; p < 2.77 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). Two SNPs with genome-wide significant GxE effects were identified by GWEIS in Generation Scotland: rs12789145 (53-kb downstream PIWIL4; p = 4.95 × 10<sup>-9</sup>; total SLE) and rs17070072 (intronic to ZCCHC2; p = 1.46 × 10<sup>-8</sup>; dependent SLE). A third locus upstream CYLC2 (rs12000047 and rs12005200, p < 2.00 × 10<sup>-8</sup>; dependent SLE) when the joint effect of the SNP main and GxE effects was considered. GWEIS gene-based tests identified: MTNR1B with GxE effect with dependent SLE in Generation Scotland; and PHF2 with the joint effect in UK Biobank (p < 2.77 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) analyses incorporating GxE effects improved the prediction of depressive symptom scores, when using weights derived from either the UK Biobank GWAS of depressive symptoms (p = 0.01) or the PGC GWAS of major depressive disorder (p = 5.91 × 10<sup>-3</sup>). Using an independent sample, PRS derived using GWEIS GxE effects provided evidence of shared aetiologies between depressive symptoms and schizotypal personality, heart disease and COPD. Further such studies are required and may result in improved treatments for depression and other stress-related conditions.",1
30716778,"Inflammation has been well recognized as one of the main drivers of atherosclerosis development and therefore cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). It has been shown that several chemokines, small 8 to 12 kDa cytokines with chemotactic properties, play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Chemokines classically mediate their effects by binding to G-protein-coupled receptors called chemokine receptors. In addition, chemokines can also bind to atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs). ACKRs fail to induce G-protein-dependent signalling pathways and thus subsequent cellular response, but instead are able to internalize, scavenge or transport chemokines. In this review, we will give an overview of the current knowledge about the involvement of ACKR1-4 in CVDs and especially in atherosclerosis development. In the recent years, several studies have highlighted the importance of ACKRs in CVDs, although there are still several controversies and unexplored aspects that have to be further elucidated. A better understanding of the precise role of these atypical receptors may pave the way towards novel and improved therapeutic strategies.",1
30706273,"This paper revisits the interaction between electricity consumption, real gross domestic product, and carbon dioxide emissions in Pakistan. To this end, our study relies on annual data from 1971 to 2014 for the econometric analysis while accounting for structural break(s). According to the Maki cointegration test, a cointegration equilibrium relationship exists among electricity consumption, economic growth, and carbon dioxide emissions. The empirical findings from Toda-Yamamoto causality test provided the following insights: (i) unidirectional causality was found running from economic growth to electricity consumption. Thus, this study validates the conservative hypothesis, meaning that in Pakistan, conservative energy strategies cannot harm economic progress. (ii) Causality was also found running from electricity consumption to carbon dioxide emissions. This implies that industrial activities trigger an increase in carbon emissions flaring which in return translates into environmental degradation. This outcome has inherent policy implications which are further discussed in the conclusion section.",0
30705288,"Rare coding variants in TREM2, PLCG2, and ABI3 were recently associated with the susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Caucasians. Frequencies and AD-associated effects of variants differ across ethnicities. To start filling the gap on AD genetics in South America and assess the impact of these variants across ethnicity, we studied these variants in Argentinian population in association with ancestry. TREM2 (rs143332484 and rs75932628), PLCG2 (rs72824905), and ABI3 (rs616338) were genotyped in 419 AD cases and 486 controls. Meta-analysis with European population was performed. Ancestry was estimated from genome-wide genotyping results. All variants show similar frequencies and odds ratios to those previously reported. Their association with AD reach statistical significance by meta-analysis. Although the Argentinian population is an admixture, variant carriers presented mainly Caucasian ancestry. Rare coding variants in TREM2, PLCG2, and ABI3 also modulate susceptibility to AD in populations from Argentina, and they may have a European heritage.",1
30698716,"A person's lipid profile is influenced by genetic variants and alcohol consumption, but the contribution of interactions between these exposures has not been studied. We therefore incorporated gene-alcohol interactions into a multiancestry genome-wide association study of levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. We included 45 studies in stage 1 (genome-wide discovery) and 66 studies in stage 2 (focused follow-up), for a total of 394,584 individuals from 5 ancestry groups. Analyses covered the period July 2014-November 2017. Genetic main effects and interaction effects were jointly assessed by means of a 2-degrees-of-freedom (df) test, and a 1-df test was used to assess the interaction effects alone. Variants at 495 loci were at least suggestively associated (P < 1 × 10-6) with lipid levels in stage 1 and were evaluated in stage 2, followed by combined analyses of stage 1 and stage 2. In the combined analysis of stages 1 and 2, a total of 147 independent loci were associated with lipid levels at P < 5 × 10-8 using 2-df tests, of which 18 were novel. No genome-wide-significant associations were found testing the interaction effect alone. The novel loci included several genes (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5 (PCSK5), vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB), and apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide 1 (APOBEC1) complementation factor (A1CF)) that have a putative role in lipid metabolism on the basis of existing evidence from cellular and experimental models.",1
30697742,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death. This study was conducted to investigate the functions and mechanisms of Zyxin (ZYX) in CRC. Multiomics analysis associated ZYX with CRC metastasis. ZYX expression levels were increased in human CRC tissues and related to shorter recurrence-free survival. Knockdown of ZYX expression resulted in inhibition of cell growth, invasion, and migration in vitro and in vivo. Comprehensive analysis of gene microarray analysis showed that ZYX may activate the pathway of NUPR1 and JNK, inhibit CST5, regulate focal adhesion (FA), and affect epithelial-mesenchymal transition in CRC cells. Results of gene microarray and membrane protein isobaric tags with relative and absolute quantitation labeling mass spectrometry found ten differentially expressed genes, which were associated with ZYX activity. Furthermore, real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the expression patterns of selected genes in the integrative analysis. Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence that decreased expression level of ZYX impairs CRC cell proliferation and metastasis probably via the FA pathway.",1
30693016,"The identification of gene-environment interactions (G × E) may eventually guide health-related choices and medical interventions for complex diseases. More powerful methods must be developed to identify G × E. The ""adaptive combination of Bayes factors method"" (ADABF) has been proposed as a powerful genome-wide polygenic approach to detect G × E. In this work, we evaluate its performance when serving as a gene-based G × E test. We compare ADABF with six tests including the ""Set-Based gene-EnviRonment InterAction test"" (SBERIA), ""gene-environment set association test"" (GESAT), etc. With extensive simulations, SBERIA and ADABF are found to be more powerful than other G × E tests. However, SBERIA suffers from a power loss when 50% SNP main effects are in the same direction with the SNP × E interaction effects while 50% are in the opposite direction. We further applied these seven G × E methods to the Taiwan Biobank data to explore gene× alcohol interactions on blood pressure levels. The <i>ADAMTS7P1</i> gene at chromosome 15q25.2 was detected to interact with alcohol consumption on diastolic blood pressure (<i>p</i> = 9.5 × 10<sup>-7</sup>, according to the GESAT test). At this gene, the <i>P</i>-values provided by other six tests all reached the suggestive significance level (<i>p</i> < 5 × 10<sup>-5</sup>). Regarding the computation time required for a genome-wide G × E analysis, SBERIA is the fastest method, followed by ADABF. Considering the validity, power performance, robustness, and computation time, ADABF is recommended for genome-wide G × E analyses.",1

30675230,"Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the association between alcohol and HCC remains unknown. The present study aimed to identify key genes related to alcohol-associated HCC to improve the current understanding of the pathology of this disease. Alcohol-associated and non-alcohol-associated HCC samples in the GSE50579 dataset of the Gene Omnibus Database were analyzed to investigate altered gene expression. Integrated bioinformatics methods were employed to clarify the biological functions of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The present study reported that candidate biomarker micro (mi)RNAs via TargetScan Human 7.1. DEGs and their associated miRNAs (according to bioinformatics analysis) were validated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Additionally, 284 EGs from the GSE50579 dataset were revealed. In GO term analysis, DEGs were closely associated with the 'regulation of nucleic acid metabolism'. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the DEGs were tightly engaged in the 'VEGF and VEGF receptor signaling network', 'proteoglycan syndecan-mediated signaling events', 'erbB receptor signaling' and 'β1 integrin cell surface interactions'. According to the results of PPI and heat map analysis, the main hub genes were centrin 3 (CETN3), Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), receptor tyrosine-protein kinase (ERBB4), heat shock protein family member 8, actin γ1 (ACTG1) and α-smooth muscle actin. it was demonstrated that the ACTG1, TLR3, miR-6819-3p and miRΝΑ (miR)-6877-3P had undefined associations. Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis revealed that miR-6819-3p and miR-6877-3P may enhance the expression levels of ACTG1 and inhibit the expression levels of TLR3 in alcohol-associated HCC tissues. TLR3 and ACTG1 were proposed as potential biomarkers of alcohol-associated HCC. Investigation into the regulatory functions of miR-6819-3p and miR-6877-3P may provide novel insights into the treatment of alcohol-associated HCC.",1
30670438,"Rifapentine is a rifamycin used to treat tuberculosis. As is the case for rifampin, plasma exposures of rifapentine are associated with the treatment response. While concomitant food intake and HIV infection explain part of the pharmacokinetic variability associated with rifapentine, few studies have evaluated the contribution of genetic polymorphisms. We evaluated the effects of functionally significant polymorphisms of the genes encoding OATP1B1, the pregnane X receptor (PXR), constitutive androstane (CAR), and arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC) on rifapentine exposure. Two studies evaluating novel regimens among southern African patients with drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis were included in this analysis. In the RIFAQUIN study, rifapentine was administered in the continuation phase of antituberculosis treatment in 1,200-mg-once-weekly or 900-mg-twice-weekly doses. In the Daily RPE study, 450 or 600 mg was given daily during the intensive phase of treatment. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was used to describe the pharmacokinetics of rifapentine and to identify significant covariates. A total of 1,144 drug concentration measurements from 326 patients were included in the analysis. Pharmacogenetic information was available for 162 patients. A one-compartment model with first-order elimination and transit compartment absorption described the data well. In a typical patient (body weight, 56 kg; fat-free mass, 45 kg), the values of clearance and volume of distribution were 1.33 liters/h and 25 liters, respectively. Patients carrying the AA variant (65.4%) of <i>AADAC</i> rs1803155 were found to have a 10.4% lower clearance. HIV-infected patients had a 21.9% lower bioavailability. Once-weekly doses of 1,200 mg were associated with a reduced clearance (13.2%) compared to that achieved with more frequently administered doses. Bioavailability was 23.3% lower among patients participating in the Daily RPE study than in those participating in the RIFAQUIN study. This is the first study to report the effect of <i>AADAC</i> rs1803155AA on rifapentine clearance. The observed increase in exposure is modest and unlikely to be of clinical relevance. The difference in bioavailability between the two studies is probably related to the differences in food intake concomitant with the dose. HIV-coinfected patients had lower rifapentine exposures.",1
30666974,"The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) has reached a remarkable milestone of completing 100 years of exemplary service to the nation.

30659475,"We aimed to detect Attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD) risk-conferring genes in adults. In children, ADHD is characterized by age-inappropriate levels of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity and may persists into adulthood. Childhood and adulthood ADHD are heritable, and are thought to represent the clinical extreme of a continuous distribution of ADHD symptoms in the general population. We aimed to leverage the power of studies of quantitative ADHD symptoms in adults who were genotyped. Within the SAGA (Study of ADHD trait genetics in adults) consortium, we estimated the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability of quantitative self-reported ADHD symptoms and carried out a genome-wide association meta-analysis in nine adult population-based and case-only cohorts of adults. A total of n = 14,689 individuals were included. In two of the SAGA cohorts we found a significant SNP-based heritability for self-rated ADHD symptom scores of respectively 15% (n = 3656) and 30% (n = 1841). The top hit of the genome-wide meta-analysis (SNP rs12661753; p-value = 3.02 × 10<sup>-7</sup>) was present in the long non-coding RNA gene STXBP5-AS1. This association was also observed in a meta-analysis of childhood ADHD symptom scores in eight population-based pediatric cohorts from the Early Genetics and Lifecourse Epidemiology (EAGLE) ADHD consortium (n = 14,776). Genome-wide meta-analysis of the SAGA and EAGLE data (n = 29,465) increased the strength of the association with the SNP rs12661753. In human HEK293 cells, expression of STXBP5-AS1 enhanced the expression of a reporter construct of STXBP5, a gene known to be involved in ""SNAP"" (Soluble NSF attachment protein) Receptor"" (SNARE) complex formation. In mouse strains featuring different levels of impulsivity, transcript levels in the prefrontal cortex of the mouse ortholog Gm28905 strongly correlated negatively with motor impulsivity as measured in the five choice serial reaction time task (r<sup>2</sup> = - 0.61; p = 0.004). Our results are consistent with an effect of the STXBP5-AS1 gene on ADHD symptom scores distribution and point to a possible biological mechanism, other than antisense RNA inhibition, involved in ADHD-related impulsivity levels.",1
30659055,"A limitation to antitumor immunity is the dysfunction of T cells in the tumor microenvironment, in part due to upregulation of coinhibitory receptors such as PD-1. Here, we describe that poliovirus receptor-related immunoglobulin domain protein (PVRIG) acts as a coinhibitory receptor in mice. Murine PVRIG interacted weakly with poliovirus receptor (PVR) but bound poliovirus receptor-like 2 (PVRL2) strongly, making the latter its principal ligand. As in humans, murine NK and NKT cells constitutively expressed PVRIG. However, when compared with humans, less PVRIG transcript and surface protein was detected in murine CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <i>ex vivo</i> However, activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells upregulated PVRIG expression. In the mouse tumor microenvironment, infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed PVRIG whereas its ligand, PVRL2, was detected predominantly on myeloid cells and tumor cells, mirroring the expression pattern in human tumors. PVRIG-deficient mouse CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells mounted a stronger antigen-specific effector response compared with wild-type CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during acute <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> infection. Furthermore, enhanced CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell effector function inhibited tumor growth in PVRIG<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared with wild-type mice and PD-L1 blockade conferred a synergistic antitumor response in PVRIG<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Therapeutic intervention with antagonistic anti-PVRIG in combination with anti-PD-L1 reduced tumor growth. Taken together, our results suggest PVRIG is an inducible checkpoint receptor and that targeting PVRIG-PVRL2 interactions results in increased CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell function and reduced tumor growth.<i>See related article on p. 257</i>.",1

30656450,"Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are genetically heterogenous conditions, often characterized by early onset, EEG interictal epileptiform abnormalities, polymorphous and drug-resistant seizures, and neurodevelopmental impairments. In this study, we investigated the genetic defects in two siblings who presented with severe DEE, microcephaly, spastic tetraplegia, diffuse brain hypomyelination, cerebellar atrophy, short stature, and kyphoscoliosis. Whole exome next-generation sequencing (WES) identified in both siblings a homozygous non-sense variant in the ACTL6B gene (NM_016188:c.820C>T;p.Gln274*) coding for a subunit of the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex nBAF. To further support these findings, a targeted ACTL6B sequencing assay was performed on a cohort of 85 unrelated DEE individuals, leading to the identification of a homozygous missense variant (NM_016188:c.1045G>A;p.Gly349Ser) in a patient. This variant did not segregate in the unaffected siblings in this family and was classified as deleterious by several prediction softwares. Interestingly, in both families, homozygous patients shared a rather homogeneous phenotype. Very few patients with ACTL6B gene variants have been sporadically reported in WES cohort studies of patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and/or congenital brain malformations. However, the limited number of patients with incomplete clinical information yet reported in the literature did not allow to establish a strong gene-disease association. Here, we provide additional genetic and clinical data on three new cases that support the pathogenic role of ACTL6B gene mutation in a syndromic form of DEE.",1
30655622,"ABC transporters are conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with humans expressing 48 transporters divided into 7 classes (ABCA, ABCB, ABCC, ABCD, ABDE, ABCF, and ABCG). Throughout the human body, ABC transporters regulate cAMP levels, chloride secretion, lipid transport, and anti-oxidant responses. We used a bioinformatic approach complemented with in vitro experimental methods for validation of the 48 known human ABC transporters in airway epithelial cells using bronchial epithelial cell gene expression datasets available in NCBI GEO from well-characterized patient populations of healthy subjects and individuals that smoke cigarettes, or have been diagnosed with COPD or asthma, with validation performed in Calu-3 airway epithelial cells. Gene expression data demonstrate that ABC transporters are variably expressed in epithelial cells from different airway generations, regulated by cigarette smoke exposure (ABCA13, ABCB6, ABCC1, and ABCC3), and differentially expressed in individuals with COPD and asthma (ABCA13, ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC9). An in vitro cell culture model of cigarette smoke exposure was able to recapitulate select observed in situ changes. Our work highlights select ABC transporter candidates of interest and a relevant in vitro model that will enable a deeper understanding of the contribution of ABC transporters in the respiratory mucosa in lung health and disease.",1
30651842,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common malignant disease that is prevalent in Asian countries. Atypical chemokine receptor 4 (ACKR4) binds to various chemokines, including C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)19, CCL21, CCL25 and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13, without inducing downstream signaling transduction. However, the role of ACKR4 in modulating NPC development remains unclear. In the present study, the effects of ACKR4 on NPC growth, invasion and metastasis were investigated, as well as the endogenous mechanisms through which ACKR4 mediates NPC development. The results demonstrated that ACKR4 was downregulated in human NPC tumor tissues, as compared with that in adjacent normal tissue. In a subcutaneous tumor animal model, the knockdown of ACKR4 enhanced NPC invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, CCL21 was accumulated in ACKR4 knockdown tumors. <i>In vitro</i>, the loss of ACKR4 increased CCL21-mediated SUNE-1 cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion. In conclusion, the loss of ACKR4 promoted CCL21-mediated NPC development; thus, neutralizing CCL21 in NPC with low ACKR4 expression may be a novel treatment strategy.",1
30643196,"Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic and cholestatic autoimmune liver disease caused by the destruction of intrahepatic small bile ducts. Our previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified six susceptibility loci for PBC. Here, in order to further elucidate the genetic architecture of PBC, a GWAS was performed on an additional independent sample set, then a genome-wide meta-analysis with our previous GWAS was performed based on a whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) imputation analysis of a total of 4,045 Japanese individuals (2,060 cases and 1,985 healthy controls). A susceptibility locus on chromosome 3q13.33 (including ARHGAP31, TMEM39A, POGLUT1, TIMMDC1, and CD80) was previously identified both in the European and Chinese populations and was replicated in the Japanese population (OR = 0.7241, P = 3.5 × 10<sup>-9</sup>). Subsequent in silico and in vitro functional analyses identified rs2293370, previously reported as the top-hit SNP in this locus in the European population, as the primary functional SNP. Moreover, e-QTL analysis indicated that the effector gene of rs2293370 was Protein O-Glucosyltransferase 1 (POGLUT1) (P = 3.4 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). This is the first study to demonstrate that POGLUT1 and not CD80 is the effector gene regulated by the primary functional SNP rs2293370, and that increased expression of POGLUT1 might be involved in the pathogenesis of PBC.",1
30621171,"Although, for decades, increased serum bilirubin concentrations were considered a threatening sign of underlying liver disease and had been associated with neonatal jaundice, data from recent years show that bilirubin is a powerful antioxidant and suggest that slightly increased serum bilirubin concentrations are protective against oxidative stress-related diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, a better understanding of the gene-diet interactions in determining serum bilirubin concentrations is needed. None of the previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on bilirubin concentrations has been stratified by sex. Therefore, considering the increasing interest in incorporating the gender perspective into nutritional genomics, our main aim was to carry out a GWAS on total serum bilirubin concentrations in a Mediterranean population with metabolic syndrome, stratified by sex. Our secondary aim was to explore, as a pilot study, the presence of gene-diet interactions at the GWAS level. We included 430 participants (188 men and 242 women, aged 55⁻75 years, and with metabolic syndrome) in the PREDIMED Plus-Valencia study. Global and sex-specific GWAS were undertaken to analyze associations and gene-diet interaction on total serum bilirubin. Adherence (low and high) to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) was analyzed as the dietary modulator. In the GWAS, we detected more than 55 SNPs associated with serum bilirubin at <i>p</i> < 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup> (GWAS level). The top-ranked were four SNPs (rs4148325 (<i>p</i> = 9.25 × 10<sup>-24</sup>), rs4148324 (<i>p</i> = 9.48 × 10<sup>-24</sup>), rs6742078 (<i>p</i> = 1.29 × 10<sup>-23</sup>), rs887829 (<i>p</i> = 1.39 × 10<sup>-23</sup>), and the rs4148324 (<i>p</i> = 9.48 × 10<sup>-24</sup>)) in the UGT1A1 (UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1) gene, which replicated previous findings revealing the UGT1A1 as the major locus. In the sex-specific GWAS, the top-ranked SNPs at the GWAS level were similar in men and women (the lead SNP was the rs4148324-UGT1A1 in both men (<i>p</i> = 4.77 × 10<sup>-11</sup>) and women (<i>p</i> = 2.15 × 10<sup>-14</sup>), which shows homogeneous genetic results for the major locus. There was more sex-specific heterogeneity for other minor genes associated at the suggestive level of GWAS significance (<i>p</i> < 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup>). We did not detect any gene-MedDiet interaction at <i>p</i> < 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup> for the major genetic locus, but we detected some gene-MedDiet interactions with other genes at <i>p</i> < 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup>, and even at the GWAS level for the IL17B gene (<i>p</i> = 3.14 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). These interaction results, however, should be interpreted with caution due to our small sample size. In conclusion, our study provides new data, with a gender perspective, on genes associated with total serum bilirubin concentrations in men and women, and suggests possible additional modulations by adherence to MedDiet.",1
30614793,"Both QKI and TMEFF2 genes are considered putative tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). In gastric (GC) and colorectal (CRC) cancers, downregulation of their expressions is known to be frequent. However, QKI and TMEFF2 mutations that could potentially inactivate their functions are not reported in cancers.",1
30610205,"Genome sequencing has revealed an increasing number of genetic variations that are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Frequently, studies limit their focus to likely gene-disrupting mutations because they are relatively easy to interpret. Missense variants, instead, have often been undervalued. However, some missense variants can be informative for developing a more profound understanding of disease pathogenesis and ultimately targeted therapies. Here we present an example of this by studying a missense variant in a well-known autism spectrum disorder (ASD) causing gene SHANK3. We analyzed Shank3's in vivo phosphorylation profile and identified S685 as one phosphorylation site where one ASD-linked variant has been reported. Detailed analysis of this variant revealed a novel function of Shank3 in recruiting Abelson interactor 1 (ABI1) and the WAVE complex to the post-synaptic density (PSD), which is critical for synapse and dendritic spine development. This function was found to be independent of Shank3's other functions such as binding to GKAP and Homer. Introduction of this human ASD mutation into mice resulted in a small subset of phenotypes seen previously in constitutive Shank3 knockout mice, including increased allogrooming, increased social dominance, and reduced pup USV. Together, these findings demonstrate the modularity of Shank3 function in vivo. This modularity further indicates that there is more than one independent pathogenic pathway downstream of Shank3 and correcting a single downstream pathway is unlikely to be sufficient for clear clinical improvement. In addition, this study illustrates the value of deep biological analysis of select missense mutations in elucidating the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric phenotypes.",1
30607900,"Vitamin or mineral supplementation is considered to be the most commonly used medical treatment for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in addition to other interventions such as neurological and psychological interventions. There is not much evidence of therapeutic efficacy between vitamin and mineral supplementation and improvements in ASD. However, several researchers have noted that patients with ASD have various metabolic and nutritional abnormalities including issues with sulfation, methylation, glutathione redox imbalances, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. There is some evidence that vitamin and mineral supplementation may support these basic physiologic processes. Recently, the nutritional status of ASD patients has been gaining focus in this particular area. Pointing out the nutritional status as a potential etiological factor for attention/communication disorders, more importance has been given to this particular point. Moreover, autistic specific considerations like the feature and behavior of ASD might be increased or at least fall in the higher risk due to the sub-optimal nutritional status.",1
30596397,"Wearable electronics have attracted a tremendous amount of attention due to their many potential applications, such as personalized health monitoring, motion detection, and smart clothing, where electronic devices must conformably form contacts with curvilinear surfaces and undergo large deformations. Structural design and material selection have been the key factors for the development of wearable electronics in the recent decades. As one of the most widely used geometries, buckling structures endow high stretchability, high mechanical durability, and comfortable contact for human-machine interaction via wearable devices. In addition, buckling structures that are derived from natural biosurfaces have high potential for use in cost-effective and high-grade wearable electronics. This review provides fundamental insights into buckling fabrication and discusses recent advancements for practical applications of buckled electronics, such as interconnects, sensors, transistors, energy storage, and conversion devices. In addition to the incorporation of desired functions, the simple and consecutive manipulation and advanced structural design of the buckled structures are discussed, which are important for advancing the field of wearable electronics. The remaining challenges and future perspectives for buckled electronics are briefly discussed in the final section.",0

30589721,"This paper examines the pattern of convergence in electricity intensity in a sample of 79 countries. We apply the residual augmented least squares regression to the convergence of energy intensity. This method has been used in the convergence of per capita energy consumption but not convergence of energy intensity. Furthermore, in contrast to the previous studies which mainly used the conventional beta convergence approach to examine conditional convergence, we use a beta convergence method that is capable of identifying the actual number of countries that contribute to conditional convergence. The sigma and gamma convergences of electricity intensity are also examined. In addition to the full sample of countries, we also examine convergence in African countries, Asian and Oceanic countries, American countries and European countries, separately. Convergences in OECD and non-OECD countries are also examined, separately. In the full sample, the results show convergence exists in 54% of the countries in the total sample. There is convergence in 65% of the African countries, 61% of the American countries, 43% of the Asian and Oceanic countries and 33% of the European countries. In terms of the regional classification, it is also observed that convergence exists for 58% of the non-OECD countries and 31% of the OECD countries. There is evidence for sigma convergence in all the blocs with the exception of European and non-OECD countries. With the exception of African countries, there is evidence for gamma convergence in all the countries and the various blocs. The policy implications of the results are discussed.",0
30575723,"Alkaline ceramidases (ACERs) are a class of poorly understood transmembrane enzymes controlling the homeostasis of ceramides. They are implicated in human pathophysiology, including progressive leukodystrophy, colon cancer as well as acute myeloid leukemia. We report here the crystal structure of the human ACER type 3 (ACER3). Together with computational studies, the structure reveals that ACER3 is an intramembrane enzyme with a seven transmembrane domain architecture and a catalytic Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site in its core, similar to adiponectin receptors. Interestingly, we uncover a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site physically and functionally connected to the Zn<sup>2+</sup> providing a structural explanation for the known regulatory role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on ACER3 enzymatic activity and for the loss of function in E33G-ACER3 mutant found in leukodystrophic patients.",1
30569173,"Adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) and adenoid basal carcinomas (ABCs) in the lower female genital tract are very rare. Data on the clinicopathologic features and survival outcomes of ACCs and ABCs in the lower female genital tract are limited to case reports and small case series studies. The present study systemically analyzed 233 cases, including 84 cervical ACCs, 78 cervical ABCs and 71 vulvar ACCs, to identify clinicopathologic features and survival factors in a population‑based Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) study. Whereas cervical ACCs and ABCs tend to occur in the elderly (median, 72 and 69 years, respectively), vulvar ACCs commonly occurred in patients a decade younger (median, 59 years). The majority of patients with cervical ABC had localized disease and almost all received surgery. In contrast, cervical and vulvar ACC patients tended to have higher stage disease, and a significant proportion of these patients received radiotherapy, with or without surgery. The 5‑year cause‑specific survival (CSS) rates for patients with cervical ACC were 69.3%, vulvar ACC 87.7% and cervical ABC 96.6%. The 5‑year overall survival (OS) rate for patients with cervical ACC was 59.2%, significantly worse than that of cervical ABC (88.3%; P=0.002) and vulvar ACC (81.2%; P=0.01). Increased age and high stage were significantly associated with a worse prognosis in patients with cervical and vulvar ACCs by univariate and multivariate analysis (P<0.05). Tumor stage was the only significant factor associated with 5‑year overall survival in patients with cervical ABC (P<0.05). The present data demonstrated that the distinctive clinicopathologic features and survival outcomes differed significantly among ACCs and ABCs in the lower female genital tract, thus providing a rationale for location/pathologic type‑based treatment modalities.",1
30563984,"It is well-established that there is a strong genetic contribution to the aetiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Here, we employed a hypothesis-free genome-wide association study (GWAS) design in a sample of 480 clinical childhood ADHD cases and 1208 controls to search for novel genetic risk loci for ADHD. DNA was genotyped using Illumina's Human Infinium PsychArray-24v1.2., and the data were subsequently imputed to the 1000 Genomes reference panel. Rigorous quality control and pruning of genotypes at both individual subject and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) levels was performed. Polygenic risk score (PGRS) analysis revealed that ADHD case-control status was explained by genetic risk for ADHD, but no other major psychiatric disorders. Logistic regression analysis was performed genome-wide to test the association between SNPs and ADHD case-control status. We observed a genome-wide significant association (p = 3.15E-08) between ADHD and rs6686722, mapped to the Tenascin R (TNR) gene. Members of this gene family are extracellular matrix glycoproteins that play a role in neural cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth. Suggestive evidence of associations with ADHD was observed for an additional 111 SNPs (⩽9.91E-05). Although intriguing, the association between DNA variation in the TNR gene and ADHD should be viewed as preliminary given the small sample size of this discovery dataset.",1
30559148,"DNA methylation is instrumental for gene regulation. Global changes in the epigenetic landscape have been recognized as a hallmark of cancer. However, the role of DNA methylation in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains unclear. In this study, high-density genetic and DNA methylation data in white blood cells from the Framingham Heart Study (<i>N</i> = 1,595) were used to build genetic models to predict DNA methylation levels. These prediction models were then applied to the summary statistics of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ovarian cancer including 22,406 EOC cases and 40,941 controls to investigate genetically predicted DNA methylation levels in association with EOC risk. Among 62,938 CpG sites investigated, genetically predicted methylation levels at 89 CpG were significantly associated with EOC risk at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of <i>P</i> < 7.94 × 10<sup>-7</sup>. Of them, 87 were located at GWAS-identified EOC susceptibility regions and two resided in a genomic region not previously reported to be associated with EOC risk. Integrative analyses of genetic, methylation, and gene expression data identified consistent directions of associations across 12 CpG, five genes, and EOC risk, suggesting that methylation at these 12 CpG may influence EOC risk by regulating expression of these five genes, namely <i>MAPT, HOXB3, ABHD8, ARHGAP27</i>, and <i>SKAP1</i>. We identified novel DNA methylation markers associated with EOC risk and propose that methylation at multiple CpG may affect EOC risk via regulation of gene expression. SIGNIFICANCE: Identification of novel DNA methylation markers associated with EOC risk suggests that methylation at multiple CpG may affect EOC risk through regulation of gene expression.",1
30541014,"BACKGROUND Acyl-coenzymeA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) 1, a key enzyme converting excess free cholesterol to cholesterol esters, has been demonstrated to be associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the mechanism underlying the protective role of ACAT1 blockage in AD progression remains elusive. MATERIAL AND METHODS Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of aggregated Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ (5, 15, 25, and 45 μmol) with or without the ACAT1 siRNA pretreatment. Cell viability analysis was measured by CCK-8 assay. The genome-wide correlation between ACAT1 and all other probe sets was measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). Western blotting was used to detect the ACAT1 protein expression in the hippocampus of APP/PSN transgenic AD mice. The mRNA level for each target was analyzed by qPCR. Western blotting was used to detect the ACAT1, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (Cox2), Calcium voltage-gated channel subunits (CACNAs), and ERK/PKC proteins in SH-SY5Y cells with or without the ACAT1 siRNA pretreatment in the presence of Aβ₂₅₋₃₅. RESULTS The expression of ACAT1 was significantly increased in the hippocampus of APP/PSN mice, and also showed an increasing trend when SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to Aβ₂₅₋₃₅. Silencing ACAT1 significantly attenuated Aβ-induced cytotoxicity and cell apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. The genome-wide correlation analysis showed that Ptgs2 had the most significant correlation with Acat1 in the hippocampus of BXD RI mice. We further determined the regulatory effect of ACAT1 on COX2 expression by silencing or over-expressing ACAT1 in SH-SY5Y cells and found that silencing ACAT1 played a protective role in AD progression by regulating CACNAs and PKC/ERK signaling cascades. CONCLUSIONS Silencing ACAT1 attenuates Aβ₂₅₋₃₅-induced cytotoxicity and cell apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells, which may due to the synergistic effect of ACAT1 and COX2 through PKC/ERK pathways.",1
30535476,"Actin‑like protein 8 (ACTL8) is a member of the cancer‑testis antigens (CTA) family, which is mainly localized in the cytoplasm and generally expressed in the testis. The association between ACTL8 and various types of cancer, including glioblastoma and breast cancer, has previously been demonstrated. However, whether ACTL8 is involved in the development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains unknown. In the present study, the expression of ACTL8 in patients with HNSCC was analyzed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, clinical tissues and cell lines. Correlations between the expression levels of ACTL8 and HNSCC clinical outcomes were analyzed with the Kaplan‑Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model. Cell Counting Kit‑8, plate colony formation and Transwell assays were used to assess the effects of ACTL8 interference on the proliferation, migration and invasion of HNSCC PCI‑13 cells. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to evaluate the expression levels of ACTL8 in PCI‑13 cells. Furthermore, alterations in the expression levels of key proteins in the phosphatidylinositol‑4,5‑bisphosphate 3‑kinase (PI3K)/RAC‑α protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway were determined by western blotting. Increased expression of ACTL8 in HNSCC was observed in TCGA dataset, cancerous tissue samples and HNSCC cell line. Cox regression analysis indicated that ACTL8 expression could be regarded as an independent prognostic factor for HNSCC, since increased expression of ACTL8 was associated with a poor prognosis. Knocking down ACTL8 markedly inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of PCI‑13 cells. Additionally, activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was suppressed by reduced expression levels of certain key proteins in this pathway. The present data indicate that ACTL8 serves a role in the progression and clinical prognosis of HNSCC. Therefore, ACTL8 may be a potential prognostic marker and novel therapeutic target for HNSCC.",1
30535457,"In our previous study, the 4‑aminobutyrate aminotransferase (ABAT) gene was screened and selected as a target gene that may affect the prognosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The present study aimed to determine the prognostic value of ABAT in 152 patients with MDS, 29 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 40 controls, by detecting the expression and methylation levels of the ABAT gene. In patients with MDS, the expression levels of ABAT were significantly reduced compared with in the controls (P<0.0001), and the degree of DNA methylation was increased in MDS subjects (P<0.0001). Age, hemoglobin level, marrow blasts, International Prognostic Scoring System karyotype, and the expression and methylation levels of ABAT were associated with overall survival (OS), as determined by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed that older age, higher marrow blasts and higher methylation percentage were independent risk factors for OS. In addition, a functional study demonstrated that ABAT gene silencing increased cell apoptosis and blocked the G1/S phase in SKM‑1 and THP‑1 human leukemia cells. A γ‑aminobutyrate aminotransferase inhibitor also blocked the G1/S phase; however, it had no effect on cell apoptosis. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that ABAT methylation served an essential role in the progression of MDS and therefore may be considered an indicator of poor prognosis for hematological malignancies.",1

30485348,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with a strong genetic component and etiology characterized by chronic inflammation and autoantibody production. The purpose of this study was to ascertain copy number variation (CNV) in SLE using a case-control design in an admixed Brazilian population. The whole-genome detection of CNV was performed using Cytoscan HD array in SLE patients and healthy controls. The best CNV candidates were then evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR in a larger cohort or validated using droplet digital PCR. Logistic regression models adjusted for sex and ancestry covariates was applied to evaluate the association between CNV with SLE susceptibility. The data showed a synergistic effect between the FCGR3B and ADAM3A loci with the presence of deletions in both loci significantly increasing the risk to SLE (5.9-fold) compared to the deletion in the single FCGR3B locus (3.6-fold). In addition, duplications in these genes were indeed more frequent in healthy subjects, suggesting that high FCGR3B/ADAM3A gene copy numbers are protective factors against to disease development. Overall, 21 rare CNVs were identified in SLE patients using a four-step pipeline created for identification of rare variants. Furthermore, heterozygous deletions overlapping the CFHR4, CFHR5 and HLA-DPB2 genes were described for the first time in SLE patients. Here we present the first genome-wide CNV study of SLE patients in a tri-hybrid population. The results show that novel susceptibility loci to SLE can be found once the distribution of structural variants is analyzed throughout the whole genome.",1
30442322,"This paper reports the development of a novel process combining thermal and electrical treatments, which are optimised to provide efficient recovery of copper foil from Random Access Memory cards (RAMs). A primary thermal transformation at 900 °C facilitates a highly efficient recovery of copper foils from RAMs during the secondary processing in the electrical fragmenter, using only 10 pulses at 150 kV. The process yield was 98% and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis showed that the copper foils had 98% purity. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the presence of copper in a crystalline face-centred cubic (FCC) form. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) - energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the foils assisted in understanding the underlying mechanism of electrical separation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) gave a new perspective on the regeneration of copper foils wherein new copper grains depicted a ribbon like growth pattern. The copper foils had an electrical conductivity similar to that of commercially available pure copper sheets. Thus, the mechanism of thermo-electrical transformation was studied in detail and regenerated copper foils of high electrical conductivity were afforded from end-of-life RAMs.",0

30419281,"Identification of alternative open reading frame-encoded peptides (AEPs) for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer at the proteome level is largely unexplored because of a lack of comprehensive proteomics data. Here, we performed a comprehensive integrative analysis of mass spectral data published by Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium and characterized 93 high-confident AEPs encoded within 75 genes. There are four cancer-related genes appeared to have AEPs identified frequently in >20 out of 95 colorectal cancer samples, including ABCF2, AR, RBM10 and NRG1. Further network analysis of the identified AEPs found the enrichment of novel AEPs within hormone androgen receptor and a highly-modularised network with 42 genes associated with patient survival. Our results not only suggested a mechanistic view of how AEPs work in cancer progression, but also shed light on somatic amino acid mutations in AEPs, which might be overlooked previously because of their low frequencies. In particular, potential high-frequency mutations in 77 samples associated with EDARADD may contribute to the discovery of new biomarkers and the development of innovative therapeutic approaches.",1
30412241,"The development of cervical cancer is initiated by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and involves both viral and host genetic factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cervical cancer have identified associations in the HLA locus and two loci outside HLA, but the principal genes that control infection and pathogenesis have not been identified. In the present study, we performed GWAS of cervical cancer in East Asian populations, involving 2609 cases and 4712 controls in the discovery stage and 1461 cases and 3295 controls in the follow-up stage. We identified novel-significant associations at 5q14 with the lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs59661306 (P = 2.4 × 10-11) and at 7p11 with the lead SNP rs7457728 (P = 1.2 × 10-8). In 5q14, the chromatin region of the GWAS-significant SNPs was found to be in contact with the promoter of the ARRDC3 (arrestin domain-containing 3) gene. In our functional studies, ARRDC3 knockdown in HeLa cells caused significant reductions in both cell growth and susceptibility to HPV16 pseudovirion infection, suggesting that ARRDC3 is involved in the infectious entry of HPV into the cell. Our study advances the understanding of host genes that are responsible for cervical cancer susceptibility and guides future research on HPV infection and cancer development.",1

30391265,"Exposure to herbicides can induce long-term chronic adverse effects such as respiratory diseases, malignancies and neurodegenerative diseases. Oxadiazon, a pre-emergence or early post-emergence herbicide, despite its low acute toxicity, may induce liver cancer and may exert adverse effects on reproductive and on endocrine functions. Unlike other herbicides, there are no indications on neurotoxicity associated with long-term exposure to oxadiazon. Therefore, we have analyzed in primary neuronal precursor cells isolated from human striatal primordium the effects of non-cytotoxic doses of oxadiazon on neuronal cell differentiation and migration, and on the expression and activity of the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) and of the acylphosphatase (ACYP). ALDH2 activity protects neurons against neurotoxicity induced by toxic aldehydes during oxidative stress and plays a role in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. ACYP is involved in ion transport, cell differentiation, programmed cell death and cancer, and increased levels of ACYP have been revealed in fibroblasts from patients affected by Alzheimer's disease. In this study we demonstrated that non-cytotoxic doses of oxadiazon were able to inhibit neuronal striatal cell migration and FGF2- and BDNF-dependent differentiation towards neuronal phenotype, and to inhibit the expression and activity of ALDH2 and to increase the expression and activity of ACYP2. In addition, we have provided evidence that in human primary neuronal precursor striatal cells the inhibitory effects of oxadiazon on cell migration and differentiation towards neuronal phenotype were achieved through modulation of ACYP2. Taken together, our findings reveal for the first time that oxadiazon could exert neurotoxic effects by impairing differentiative capabilities of primary neuronal cells and indicate that ALDH2 and ACYP2 are relevant molecular targets for the neurotoxic effects of oxadiazon, suggesting a potential role of this herbicide in the onset of neurodegenerative diseases.",1
30389748,"A genetic predisposition to higher waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), a measure of body fat distribution, associates with increased risk for type 2 diabetes. We conducted an exome-wide association study of coding variation in UK Biobank (405,569 individuals) to identify variants that lower WHRadjBMI and protect against type 2 diabetes. We identified four variants in the gene <i>ACVR1C</i> (encoding the activin receptor-like kinase 7 receptor expressed on adipocytes and pancreatic β-cells), which independently associated with reduced WHRadjBMI: Asn150His (-0.09 SD, <i>P</i> = 3.4 × 10<sup>-17</sup>), Ile195Thr (-0.15 SD, <i>P</i> = 1.0 × 10<sup>-9</sup>), Ile482Val (-0.019 SD, <i>P</i> = 1.6 × 10<sup>-5</sup>), and rs72927479 (-0.035 SD, <i>P</i> = 2.6 × 10<sup>-12</sup>). Carriers of these variants exhibited reduced percent abdominal fat in DEXA imaging. Pooling across all four variants, a 0.2 SD decrease in WHRadjBMI through <i>ACVR1C</i> was associated with a 30% lower risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 0.70, 95% CI 0.63, 0.77; <i>P</i> = 5.6 × 10<sup>-13</sup>). In an analysis of exome sequences from 55,516 individuals, carriers of predicted damaging variants in <i>ACVR1C</i> were at 54% lower risk of type 2 diabetes (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27, 0.81; <i>P</i> = 0.006). These findings indicate that variants predicted to lead to loss of <i>ACVR1C</i> gene function influence body fat distribution and protect from type 2 diabetes.",1

30345310,"Atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs) are a subclass of G protein-coupled receptors characterized by promiscuity of ligand binding and an obvious inability to signal after ligand binding. Although some discoveries regarding this family in <i>Homo sapiens</i> and other species have been reported in some studies, the evolution and function of multiple ACKR in mammals have not yet been clearly understood. We performed an evolutionary analysis of <i>ACKR</i> genes (<i>ACKR1</i>, <i>ACKR2</i>, <i>ACKR3</i>, and <i>ACKR4</i>) in mammals. Ninety-two full-length <i>ACKR</i> genes from 27 mammal species were retrieved from the Genbank and Ensemble databases. Phylogenetic analysis showed that there were four well-conserved subfamilies in mammals. Synteny analysis revealed that <i>ACKR</i> genes formed conserved linkage groups with their adjacent genes across mammalian species, facilitating the identification of <i>ACKRs</i> in as yet unannotated genome datasets. Analysis of the site-specific profiles established by posterior probability revealed the positive-selection sites to be distributed mainly in the ligand binding region of ACKR1. This study highlights the molecular evolution of the <i>ACKR</i> gene family in mammals and identifies the critical amino acid residues likely to be relevant to ligand binding. Further experimental verification of these findings may provide valuable information regarding the ACKR's biochemical and physiological functions.",1

30281865,"A common null polymorphism in the ACTN3 gene (rs1815739:C>T) results in replacement of an arginine (R) with a premature stop codon (X) at amino acid 577 in the fast muscle protein α-actinin-3. The ACTN3 p.Arg577Ter allele (aka p.R577* or R577X) has undergone positive selection, with an increase in the X allele frequency as modern humans migrated out of Africa into the colder, less species-rich Eurasian climates suggesting that the absence of α-actinin-3 may be beneficial in these conditions. Approximately 1.5 billion people worldwide are completely deficient in α-actinin-3. While the absence of α-actinin-3 influences skeletal muscle function and metabolism this does not result in overt muscle disease. α-Actinin-3 deficiency (ACTN3 XX genotype) is constantly underrepresented in sprint/power performance athletes. However, recent findings from our group and others suggest that the ACTN3 R577X genotype plays a role beyond athletic performance with effects observed in ageing, bone health, and inherited muscle disorders such as McArdle disease and Duchenne muscle dystrophy. In this review, we provide an update on the current knowledge regarding the influence of ACTN3 R577X on skeletal muscle function and its potential biological and clinical implications. We also outline future research directions to explore the role of α-actinin-3 in healthy and diseased populations.",1
30267110,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a self-limiting systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. KD is often complicated by coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs), which develop in about 20-25% of untreated children and 3-5% of children treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. To identify the risk loci for CAA susceptibility in patients with KD, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using our previous Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip data (296 KD patients) and a new replication study in an independent sample set (713 KD patients) by grouping KD patients without CAA (control) versus KD patients with extremely large aneurysms (diameter ≥ 5 mm) (case). Among 44 candidate single -nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from the initial GWAS data (33 cases vs. 215 controls), a SNP (rs899162) located 7 kb upstream of the TIFAB gene on chromosome five was replicated in an independent sample (12 cases vs. 532 controls). In the combined analysis (45 cases vs. 747 controls), the SNP (rs899162) showed a highly significant association with CAA formation (diameter ≥ 5 mm) in patients with KD (odds ratio = 3.20, 95% confidence interval = 2.02-5.05, P<sub>combined</sub> = 1.95 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). These results indicate that the TIFAB gene may act as a CAA susceptibility locus in patients with KD.",1

There are some studies of valid endogenous control genes in the field of human glioma research, which, however, only focus on the comparison between normal brain with tumor tissue and malignant transformation toward secondary glioblastomas. Aim of this study was to validate a more general reference gene also suitable for pre- and posttreatment analysis and other evaluations (eg, primary vs secondary glioblastoma).",0
30259693,"When recombinant DNA technology was developed more than 40 years ago, no one could have imagined the impact it would have on both society and the scientific community. In the field of genetic engineering, the most important tool developed was the plasmid vector. This technology has been continuously expanding and undergoing adaptations. Here, we provide a detailed view following the evolution of vectors built throughout the years destined to study microorganisms and their peculiarities, including those whose genomes can only be revealed through metagenomics. We remark how synthetic biology became a turning point in designing these genetic tools to create meaningful innovations. We have placed special focus on the tools for engineering bacteria and fungi (both yeast and filamentous fungi) and those available to construct metagenomic libraries. Based on this overview, future goals would include the development of modular vectors bearing standardized parts and orthogonally designed circuits, a task not fully addressed thus far. Finally, we present some challenges that should be overcome to enable the next generation of vector design and ways to address it.",0
30253142,"Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IBDHD) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder related to valine catabolism and results from variants in ACAD8. Here, we present the clinical, biochemical, and genotypes of seven patients with IBDHD in China for the first time. Five patients remained asymptomatic during follow-up, whereas one juvenile had speech delay and one newborn exhibited clinical symptoms. All patients showed remarkably increased concentrations of C4-aclycarnitine with elevated C4/C2 and C4/C3 ratios. In urine organic acid tests, only one patient presented with an increased concentration of isobutyrylglycine excretion. Genetic testing was performed to detect the causative variants. Five previously unreported variants, c.235C > G, c.286G > A, c.444G > T c.1092 + 1G > A, and c.1176G > T, and one known variant, c.1000C > T, in ACAD8 were identified. These previously unreported variants in ACAD8 were predicted to be disease-causing and the c.1092 + 1G > A variant was confirmed to cause skipping of exon 9 by reverse transcription PCR. The most common variant was c.286G > A, which showed an allelic frequency of 50% (7/14), and thus may be a prevalent variant among Chinese patients. Our results broaden the mutational spectrum of ACAD8 and improve the understanding of the clinical phenotype of IBDHD.",1

30248107,"Hair plays an important role in primates and is clearly subject to adaptive selection. While humans have lost most facial hair, eyebrows are a notable exception. Eyebrow thickness is heritable and widely believed to be subject to sexual selection. Nevertheless, few genomic studies have explored its genetic basis. Here, we performed a genome-wide scan for eyebrow thickness in 2961 Han Chinese. We identified two new loci of genome-wide significance, at 3q26.33 near SOX2 (rs1345417: P = 6.51×10(-10)) and at 5q13.2 near FOXD1 (rs12651896: P = 1.73×10(-8)). We further replicated our findings in the Uyghurs, a population from China characterized by East Asian-European admixture (N = 721), the CANDELA cohort from five Latin American countries (N = 2301), and the Rotterdam Study cohort of Dutch Europeans (N = 4411). A meta-analysis combining the full GWAS results from the three cohorts of full or partial Asian descent (Han Chinese, Uyghur and Latin Americans, N = 5983) highlighted a third signal of genome-wide significance at 2q12.3 (rs1866188: P = 5.81×10(-11)) near EDAR. We performed fine-mapping and prioritized four variants for further experimental verification. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing provided evidence that rs1345417 and rs12651896 affect the transcriptional activity of the nearby SOX2 and FOXD1 genes, which are both involved in hair development. Finally, suitable statistical analyses revealed that none of the associated variants showed clear signals of selection in any of the populations tested. Contrary to popular speculation, we found no evidence that eyebrow thickness is subject to strong selective pressure.",1
30242241,"Excessive sodium intake is a global risk factor for hypertension. Sodium effects on blood pressure vary from person to person; hence, high-risk group targeting based on personal genetic information can play a complementary role to ongoing population preventive approaches to reduce sodium consumption. To identify genetic factors that modulate sodium effects on blood pressure, we conducted a population-based genome-wide interaction analysis in 8,768 Japanese subjects, which was >3 times larger than a similar previous study. We tested 7,135,436 polymorphisms in the discovery cohort, and loci that met suggestive significance were further examined in an independent replication cohort. We found that an interaction between a novel 3'-BCL11B gene desert locus and daily sodium consumption was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure in both discovery and replication cohorts under the recessive model. Further statistical analysis of rs8022678, the sentinel variant of the 3'-BCL11B gene desert locus, showed that differences in mean systolic blood pressure between high and low sodium consumption subgroups were 5.9 mm Hg (P = 8.8 × 10<sup>-12</sup>) in rs8022678 A carriers and -0.3 mm Hg (P = 0.27) in rs8022678 A non-carriers, suggesting that the rs8022678 genotype can classify persons into sodium-sensitive (A carriers) and sodium-insensitive (A non-carriers) subgroups. Our results implied that rs8022678 A carriers may receive a greater benefit from sodium-lowering interventions than non-carriers.",1
30219835,"The exploration of 'gene-environment interactions' (G × E) is important for disease prediction and prevention. The scientific community usually uses external information to construct a genetic risk score (GRS), and then tests the interaction between this GRS and an environmental factor (E). However, external genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are not always available, especially for non-Caucasian ethnicity. Although GRS is an analysis tool to detect G × E in GWAS, its performance remains unclear when there is no external information. Our 'adaptive combination of Bayes factors method' (ADABF) can aggregate G × E signals and test the significance of G × E by a polygenic test. We here explore a powerful polygenic approach for G × E when external information is unavailable, by comparing our ADABF with the GRS based on marginal effects of SNPs (GRS-M) and GRS based on SNP × E interactions (GRS-I). ADABF is the most powerful method in the absence of SNP main effects, whereas GRS-M is generally the best test when single-nucleotide polymorphisms main effects exist. GRS-I is the least powerful test due to its data-splitting strategy. Furthermore, we apply these methods to Taiwan Biobank data. ADABF and GRS-M identified gene × alcohol and gene × smoking interactions on blood pressure (BP). BP-increasing alleles elevate more BP in drinkers (smokers) than in nondrinkers (nonsmokers). This work provides guidance to choose a polygenic approach to detect G × E when external information is unavailable.",1
30210331,"Human neurons function over an entire lifetime, yet the molecular mechanisms which perform their functions and protecting against neurodegenerative disease during aging are still elusive. Here, we conducted a systematic study on the human brain aging by using the weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) method to identify meaningful modules or representative biomarkers for human brain aging. Significantly, 19 distinct gene modules were detected based on the dataset GSE53890; among them, six modules related to the feature of brain aging were highly preserved in diverse independent datasets. Interestingly, network feature analysis confirmed that the blue modules demonstrated a remarkably correlation with human brain aging progress. Besides, the top hub genes including PPP3CB, CAMSAP1, ACTR3B, and GNG3 were identified and characterized by high connectivity, module membership, or gene significance in the blue module. Furthermore, these genes were validated in mice of different ages. Mechanically, the potential regulators of blue module were investigated. These findings highlight an important role of the blue module and its affiliated genes in the control of normal brain aging, which may lead to potential therapeutic interventions for brain aging by targeting the hub genes.",1
30206977,"Metformin exhibits antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in a variety of diseases, characterized by malignant and nonmalignant hyperplastic cells; however, the underlying molecular mechanism of metformin in psoriasis has not been elucidated. In the current study, we found that after metformin treatment the proliferation of human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) was significantly inhibited, while cell apoptosis was increased in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied with enhanced protein expression of acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase 10 (ACAD10). Furthermore, mechanism analysis revealed that ACAD10 expression is induced by downregulated activities of mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC1) signaling rather than AMP-activated protein kinase signaling. The inactivation of mTORC1 by rapamycin pretreatment or rotenone-induced mitochondrial complex inhibition showed a similar effect because of the metformin treatment on the proliferation and apoptosis of HaCaT keratinocytes. Overexpression of mTORC1 almost reversed the antiproliferation and proapoptosis effects induced by metformin. This study showed that the metformin treatment inhibited HaCaT cells proliferation and promoted apoptosis by affecting the mitochondrial-mTORC1 signaling and elevated the ACAD10 expression. Hence, metformin can be used as a potential therapeutic agent for psoriasis.",1
30191429,"Bacteriophage contamination and cell lysis have been recurring issues with some actinomycetes used in the pharmaceutical fermentation industry since the commercialization of streptomycin in the 1940s. In the early years, spontaneous phage-resistant mutants or lysogens were isolated to address the problem. In some cases, multiple phages were isolated from different contaminated fermentors, so strains resistant to multiple phages were isolated to stabilize the fermentation processes. With the advent of recombinant DNA technology, the early scaleup of the Escherichia coli fermentation process for the production of human insulin A and B chains encountered contamination with multiple coliphages. A genetic engineering solution was to clone and express a potent restriction/modification system in the production strains. Very recently, an E. coli fermentation of 1,3-propanediol was contaminated by a coliphage related to T1. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was applied to block future contamination by targeting seven different phage genes for double-strand cleavage. These approaches employing spontaneous mutation, genetic engineering, and synthetic biology can be applied to many current and future microorganisms used in the biotechnology industry.",0
30190423,"ADAM28 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 28) is overexpressed by carcinoma cells in non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) and plays an important role in cancer cell proliferation and metastasis by reactivation of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and escaping from von Willebrand factor (VWF)-induced apoptosis through digestion of IGF-binding protein-3 and VWF, respectively. To aim for new target therapy of NSCLC patients, we developed human neutralizing antibodies 211-12 and 211-14 against ADAM28, which showed IC<sub>50</sub> values of 62.4 and 37.5 nmol/L, respectively. Antibody 211-14 recognized the junctional region between cysteine-rich domain and secreted-specific domain and showed a K<sub>D</sub> value of 94.7 pmol/L for the epitope-containing peptide. This antibody detected monkey and human secreted-form ADAM28s, although it was not reactive with mouse membrane-anchored ADAM28m. Antibody 211-14 effectively inhibited IGF-1-stimulated cell proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with ADAM28 expression, including PC-9 cells, and promoted VWF-induced cell death in these cell lines. In lung metastasis models, antibody 211-14 significantly reduced tumor growth and metastases of PC-9 cells and prolonged survivals in the antibody-treated mice compared with the control IgG-treated ones. Combination therapy of the antibody and docetaxel was more effective than that of bevacizumab and docetaxel and showed further elongation of survival time compared with monotherapy. No adverse effects were observed even after administration of 10-fold more than effective dose of anti-ADAM28 antibody to normal mice. Our data demonstrate that antibody 211-14 is a neutralizing antibody specific to ADAM28s and suggest that this antibody may be a useful treatment remedy for NSCLC patients. <i>Mol Cancer Ther; 17(11); 2427-38. ©2018 AACR</i>.",1

30181555,"Risk-taking behaviour is an important component of several psychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Previously, two genetic loci have been associated with self-reported risk taking and significant genetic overlap with psychiatric disorders was identified within a subsample of UK Biobank. Using the white British participants of the full UK Biobank cohort (n = 83,677 risk takers versus 244,662 controls) for our primary analysis, we conducted a genome-wide association study of self-reported risk-taking behaviour. In secondary analyses, we assessed sex-specific effects, trans-ethnic heterogeneity and genetic overlap with psychiatric traits. We also investigated the impact of risk-taking-associated SNPs on both gene expression and structural brain imaging. We identified 10 independent loci for risk-taking behaviour, of which eight were novel and two replicated previous findings. In addition, we found two further sex-specific risk-taking loci. There were strong positive genetic correlations between risk-taking and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Index genetic variants demonstrated effects generally consistent with the discovery analysis in individuals of non-British White, South Asian, African-Caribbean or mixed ethnicity. Polygenic risk scores comprising alleles associated with increased risk taking were associated with lower white matter integrity. Genotype-specific expression pattern analyses highlighted DPYSL5, CGREF1 and C15orf59 as plausible candidate genes. Overall, our findings substantially advance our understanding of the biology of risk-taking behaviour, including the possibility of sex-specific contributions, and reveal consistency across ethnicities. We further highlight several putative novel candidate genes, which may mediate these genetic effects.",1

In this study, three different types of photocatalysts: TiO<sub>2</sub>, ZnO and α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> were immobilized respectively on carbon cloth (CC), and applied as photoanodes in the photocatalytic fuel cell of this hybrid system. Photocatalytic fuel cell was employed to drive a peroxi-coagulation process by generating the external voltage accompanying with degrading organic pollutants under UV light irradiation. The degradation efficiency of Amaranth dye and power output in the hybrid system of PFC-PC were evaluated by applying different photoanode materials fabricated in this study. In addition, the effect of light on the photocurrent of three different photoanode materials was investigated. In the absence of light, the reduction of photocurrent percentage was found to be 69.7%, 17.3% and 93.2% in TiO<sub>2</sub>/CC, ZnO/CC and α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/CC photoanodes, respectively. A maximum power density (1.17 mWcm<sup>-2</sup>) and degradation of dye (93.8%) at PFC reactor were achieved by using ZnO/CC as photoanode. However, the different photoanode materials at PFC showed insignificant difference in dye degradation trend in the PC reactor. Meanwhile, the degradation trend of Amaranth at PFC reactor was influenced by the recombination rate, electron mobility and band gap energy of photocatalyst among different photoanode materials.",0

30122372,"Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is characteristic of almost all fundamental lineages of land plants. Unfortunately, the timings of WGD events are loosely constrained and hypotheses of evolutionary consequence are poorly formulated, making them difficult to test. Using examples from across the plant kingdom, we show that estimates of timing can be improved through the application of molecular clock methodology to multigene datasets. Further, we show that phenotypic change can be quantified in morphospaces and that relative phenotypic disparity can be compared in the light of WGD. Together, these approaches facilitate tests of hypotheses on the role of WGD in plant evolution, underscoring the potential of plants as a model system for investigating the role WGD in macroevolution.",0

30103756,"Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 Knockout Screening was applied to investigate novel targets in imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). 20 genes and 2 miRNAs have been selected by total reads of sgRNA and sgRNA diversity, which has been further validated in imatinib-resistant GIST cells by CCK8 and qPCR analysis. Our study has finally revealed 9 genes (DBP, NR3C1, TCF12, TP53, ZNF12, SOCS6, ZFP36, ACYP1, and DRD1) involved in imatinib-resistant GIST-T1 cells. TP53 and SOCS6 may be the most promising candidate genes for imatinib-resistance due to the possible signaling pathway, such as apoptosis pathway and Wnt signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway.

30102696,"Biliary atresia (BA) is a rare pediatric cholangiopathy characterized by fibrosclerosing obliteration of the extrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventual liver failure. The etiology of BA remains unknown, although environmental, inflammatory, infectious, and genetic risk factors have been proposed. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a European-American cohort of 343 isolated BA patients and 1716 controls to identify genetic loci associated with BA. A second GWAS was performed in an independent European-American cohort of 156 patients with BA and other extrahepatic anomalies and 212 controls to confirm the identified candidate BA-associated SNPs. Meta-analysis revealed three genome-wide significant BA-associated SNPs on 2p16.1 (rs10865291, rs6761893, and rs727878; P < 5 ×10-8), located within the fifth intron of the EFEMP1 gene, which encodes a secreted extracellular protein implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling, cell proliferation, and organogenesis. RNA expression analysis showed an increase in EFEMP1 transcripts from human liver specimens isolated from patients with either BA or other cholestatic diseases when compared to normal control liver samples. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that EFEMP1 is expressed in cholangiocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells in liver specimens from patients with BA and other cholestatic diseases, but it is absent from cholangiocytes in normal control liver samples. Efemp1 transcripts had higher expression in cholangiocytes and portal fibroblasts as compared with other cell types in normal rat liver.

30078471,"Differently from other digestive malignancies, gastric cancer (GC) carcinogenesis seems more heterogeneous and unclear. This entails failing in identification of reliable serum tumor markers for screening early GC (EGC) as well as persisting ominous prognosis of this disease. Recently, investigation of human noncoding genome, especially long noncoding molecules (lncRNAs), has provided promising data. As for GC, however, since the current information on GC-specific lncRNAs is still scarce and comes largely from analyses performed on tissue or serum of affected patients, we decided to review the current literature dealing with expression of such molecules in the gastric juice (GJ) of GC patients. In the case of GC, in fact, several cytological and molecular works have already demonstrated GJ to be an interesting biological material for improving clinicopathologic and prognostic knowledge of this cancer. For this review, we burrowed into the literature on lncRNAs expressed in GJ of GC patients. PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and ResearchGate were the search engines entertained. As of 2018, only seven studies have been reported. LINC00152, AA174084, UCA1, RMRP, ABHD11-AS1, LINC00982 and H19 were the GJ lncRNAs examined. Following our review, we can conclude that, due to their high specificity and reliability, GJ lncRNAs should deserve a prominent role in the field of GC research: importantly, they could be used for screening EGC, ameliorating the existing methods of staging (which are still far from being completely accurate), improving the prognostic capacity of the current diagnostic armamentarium and, finally, providing new and valuable therapeutic targets.",1

30020108,"According to literature, electrostimulation of plants can induce plant movement, activation of ion channels, ion transport, gene expression, enzymatic system activation, electrical signaling, plant-cell damage, enhanced wound healing, and can also influence plant growth. Many plants can communicate above ground and underground between adjacent plants. Electrostimulation by square pulses induces passive electrotonic potentials propagating within and between tomato plants. The amplitude and sign of electrotonic potentials, in both the electrostimulated and neighboring tomato plants depends on the amplitude, rise and fall of the applied voltage. Electrostimulation by the pulse train, sinusoidal and triangular saw-shape voltage profile shows the existence of electrical differentiators and refractory periods in cell-to-cell electrical coupling in tomato plants. Electrical networks within one tomato plant can communicate underground with electrical circuits in another tomato plant. Here, we present the mathematical model of electrotonic potentials transmission between tomato plants which is supported by the experimental data. The information gained from this mathematical model and analytical study can be used not only to elucidate the effects of electrostimulation on higher plants, but also to observe and predict the intercellular and intracellular communication in the form of electrical signals within the electrical networks within and between tomato plants.",0

30003865,"Genetic coding in bacteria largely operates via the ""one gene-one protein"" paradigm. However, the peculiarities of the mRNA structure, the versatility of the genetic code, and the dynamic nature of translation sometimes allow organisms to deviate from the standard rules of protein encoding. Bacteria can use several unorthodox modes of translation to express more than one protein from a single mRNA cistron. One such alternative path is the use of additional translation initiation sites within the gene. Proteins whose translation is initiated at different start sites within the same reading frame will differ in their N termini but will have identical C-terminal segments. On the other hand, alternative initiation of translation in a register different from the frame dictated by the primary start codon will yield a protein whose sequence is entirely different from the one encoded in the main frame. The use of internal mRNA codons as translation start sites is controlled by the nucleotide sequence and the mRNA folding. The proteins of the alternative proteome generated via the ""genes-within-genes"" strategy may carry important functions. In this review, we summarize the currently known examples of bacterial genes encoding more than one protein due to the utilization of additional translation start sites and discuss the known or proposed functions of the alternative polypeptides in relation to the main protein product of the gene. We also discuss recent proteome- and genome-wide approaches that will allow the discovery of novel translation initiation sites in a systematic fashion.",0
29998114,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted in participants of the CO-MED (Combining Medications to Enhance Depression Outcomes) trial, a randomized, 3-treatment arm clinical trial of major depressive disorder (MDD) designed to identify markers of differential treatment outcome (response and remission). The QIDS-SR (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Self-Reported version) was used to measure response at week 6 (QIDS-SR ≤5) and remission at week 12 (QIDS-SR ≤6 and ≤8 at the last two study visits). Three treatment groups (escitalopram monotherapy, escitalopram + bupropion, and venlafaxine + mirtazapine) were evaluated. GWAS identified a potentially regulatory SNP rs10769025 in the ALX4 gene on chromosome 11 with a strong association (<i>p</i> value = 9.85925E-08) with response to escitalopram monotherapy in Caucasians. Further, haplotype analysis on 7 ALX4 variants showed that a regulatory haplotype CAAACTG was significantly associated (odds ratio = 3.4, <i>p</i> = 2.00E-04) with response to escitalopram monotherapy at week 6. Ingenuity pathway analyses in the present study suggest that ALX4 has an indirect connection with antidepressant gene pathways in MDD, which may account for the genetic association with treatment outcome. Functional genomics studies to investigate the role of ALX4 in antidepressant treatment outcome will be an interesting future direction.",1
29956756,"In this study, we aimed to identify the tumor suppressive roles of zinc finger of the cerebellum 1 (ZIC1) in patients with malignant breast neoplasms and to examine the association between ZIC1 and survivin expression. For this purpose, 140 invasive breast cancer specimens, 1,075 RNA breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 6 human breast cancer cell lines and MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells were selected in order to compare the expression level of ZIC1 with that of survivin via immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Subsequently, the MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR3 cells with a lower ZIC1 expression were transfected with rLV-Zic1-PGK-Puro lentivirus or rLV-ZsGreen-PGK‑Puro lentivirus in order to observe any alterations in cell proliferation and apoptosis through MTT assay, colony formation assay, mitochondrial membrane potential assay and flow cytometric analysis, and to analyze the modulation of molecular mechanisms by western blot analysis. In addition, xenograft mouse models were constructed to explore the role of ZIC1 in the growth of implanted tumors. The results revealed that ZIC1 negatively correlated with survivin in tumors and cells, and a higher ZIC1 RNA expression indicated a better overall survival in the 1,075 TCGA RNA breast cancer samples. In vitro, the overexpression of ZIC1 inhibited cell proliferation, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and promoted the apoptosis of the MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR3 breast cancer cells by inactivating the Akt/mTOR/P70S6K pathway, suppressing survivin expression, modulating the cell cycle, releasing cytochrome c (Cyto-c) into the cytosol and activating caspase proteins. In vivo, an elevated ZIC1 expression suppressed the growth of implanted tumors and downregulated survivin expression in tumors. On the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that ZIC1 plays a tumor suppressive role in breast cancer, by targeting surviving, significantly downregulating its expression.",1

One hundred twenty lincRNAs had adipose-enriched expression, and 54 of these exhibited peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) or CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) binding at their loci. Most of these adipose-enriched lincRNAs (~85%) were not conserved in mice, yet on average, they showed degrees of expression and binding of PPARγ and C/EBPα similar to those displayed by conserved lincRNAs. Most adipose lincRNAs differentially expressed (<i>n</i> = 53) in patients after bariatric surgery were nonconserved. The most abundant adipose-enriched lincRNA in our subcutaneous adipose data set, <i>linc-ADAL</i>, was nonconserved, up-regulated in adipose depots of obese individuals, and markedly induced during in vitro human adipocyte differentiation. We demonstrated that <i>linc-ADAL</i> interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNPU) and insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) at distinct subcellular locations to regulate adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis.",1
29924424,"Osteoporosis is one of the most common age-related progressive bone diseases in elderly people. Approximately one in three women and one in five men are predisposed to developing osteoporosis. In postmenopausal women, a reduction in BMD leads to an increased risk of fractures. In the current study, we delineated the DNA methylation signatures in whole blood samples of postmenopausal osteoporotic women. We obtained whole blood DNA from 22 normal women and 22 postmenopausal osteoporotic women (51 to 89 years old) from the Canadian Multicenter Osteoporosis Study (CaMos) cohort. These DNA samples were subjected to Illumina Infinium human methylation 450 K analysis. Illumina 450K raw data were analyzed by Genome Studio software. Analysis of the female participants with early and advanced osteoporosis resulted in the generation of a list of 1233 differentially methylated CpG sites when compared with age-matched normal women. T test, ANOVA, and post hoc statistical analyses were performed, and 77 significantly differentially methylated CpG sites were identified. From the 13 most significant genes, ZNF267, ABLIM2, RHOJ, CDKL5, and PDCD1 were selected for their potential role in bone biology. A weighted polygenic DNA methylation score of these genes predicted osteoporosis at an early stage with high sensitivity and specificity and correlated with measures of bone density. Pyrosequencing analysis of these genes was performed to validate the results obtained from Illumina 450 K methylation analysis. The current study provides proof of principal for the role of DNA methylation in osteoporosis. Using whole blood DNA methylation analysis, women at risk of developing osteoporosis can be identified before a diagnosis of osteoporosis is made using BMD as a screening method. Early diagnosis will help to select patients who might benefit from early therapeutic intervention. © 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",1
29912962,"Heavy alcohol consumption is an established risk factor for hypertension; the mechanism by which alcohol consumption impact blood pressure (BP) regulation remains unknown. We hypothesized that a genome-wide association study accounting for gene-alcohol consumption interaction for BP might identify additional BP loci and contribute to the understanding of alcohol-related BP regulation. We conducted a large two-stage investigation incorporating joint testing of main genetic effects and single nucleotide variant (SNV)-alcohol consumption interactions. In Stage 1, genome-wide discovery meta-analyses in ≈131K individuals across several ancestry groups yielded 3,514 SNVs (245 loci) with suggestive evidence of association (P < 1.0 x 10-5). In Stage 2, these SNVs were tested for independent external replication in ≈440K individuals across multiple ancestries. We identified and replicated (at Bonferroni correction threshold) five novel BP loci (380 SNVs in 21 genes) and 49 previously reported BP loci (2,159 SNVs in 109 genes) in European ancestry, and in multi-ancestry meta-analyses (P < 5.0 x 10-8). For African ancestry samples, we detected 18 potentially novel BP loci (P < 5.0 x 10-8) in Stage 1 that warrant further replication. Additionally, correlated meta-analysis identified eight novel BP loci (11 genes). Several genes in these loci (e.g., PINX1, GATA4, BLK, FTO and GABBR2) have been previously reported to be associated with alcohol consumption. These findings provide insights into the role of alcohol consumption in the genetic architecture of hypertension.",1
29907492,"This study assessed genetic contributions to six cognitive domains, identified by the MATRICS Cognitive Consensus Battery as relevant for schizophrenia, cognition-enhancing, clinical trials. Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Schizophrenia polygenic risk scores showed significant negative correlations with each cognitive domain. Genome-wide association analyses identified loci associated with attention/vigilance (rs830786 within HNF4G), verbal memory (rs67017972 near NDUFS4), and reasoning/problem solving (rs76872642 within HDAC9). Gene set analysis identified unique and shared genes across cognitive domains. These findings suggest involvement of common and unique mechanisms across cognitive domains and may contribute to the discovery of new therapeutic targets to treat cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",1
29885931,"African Americans carrying two apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) renal risk variants have a high risk for nephropathy. However, only a minority develops end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hence, modifying factors likely contribute to initiation of kidney disease such as endogenous (HIV infection) or exogenous (interferon treatment) environmental modifiers. In this report, genome-wide association studies and a meta-analysis were performed to identify novel loci for nondiabetic ESRD in African Americans and to detect genetic modifiers in APOL1-associated nephropathy. Two African American cohorts were analyzed, 1749 nondiabetic ESRD cases and 1136 controls from Wake Forest and 901 lupus nephritis (LN)-ESRD cases and 520 controls with systemic lupus erythematosus but lacking nephropathy from the LN-ESRD Consortium. Association analyses adjusting for APOL1 G1/G2 renal-risk variants were completed and stratified by APOL1 risk genotype status. Individual genome-wide association studies and meta-analysis results of all 2650 ESRD cases and 1656 controls did not detect significant genome-wide associations with ESRD beyond APOL1. Similarly, no single nucleotide polymorphism showed significant genome-wide evidence of an interaction with APOL1 risk variants. Thus, although variants with small individual effects cannot be ruled out and are likely to exist, our results suggest that APOL1-environment interactions may be of greater clinical importance in triggering nephropathy in African Americans than APOL1 interactions with other single nucleotide polymorphisms.",1
29885460,"ADAMTS proteins are a superfamily of 26 secreted molecules comprising two related, but distinct families. ADAMTS proteases are zinc metalloendopeptidases, most of whose substrates are extracellular matrix (ECM) components, whereas ADAMTS-like proteins lack a metalloprotease domain, reside in the ECM and have regulatory roles vis-à-vis ECM assembly and/or ADAMTS activity. Evolutionary conservation and expansion of ADAMTS proteins in mammals is suggestive of crucial embryologic or physiological roles in humans. Indeed, Mendelian disorders or birth defects resulting from naturally occurring ADAMTS2, ADAMTS3, ADAMTS10, ADAMTS13, ADAMTS17, ADAMTS20, ADAMTSL2 and ADAMTSL4 mutations as well as numerous phenotypes identified in genetically engineered mice have revealed ADAMTS participation in major biological pathways. Important roles have been identified in a few acquired conditions. ADAMTS5 is unequivocally implicated in pathogenesis of osteoarthritis via degradation of aggrecan, a major structural proteoglycan in cartilage. ADAMTS7 is strongly associated with coronary artery disease and promotes atherosclerosis. Autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 lead to a platelet coagulopathy, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which is similar to that resulting from ADAMTS13 mutations. ADAMTS proteins have numerous potential connections to other human disorders that were identified by genome-wide association studies. Here, we review inherited and acquired human disorders in which ADAMTS proteins participate, and discuss progress and prospects in therapeutics.",1
29882479,"Differentiation of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) involves a series of molecular signals and gene transcription events required for attaining cell lineage commitment. Modulation of the actin cytoskeleton using cytochalasin D (CytoD) drives osteogenesis at early timepoints in bone marrow-derived MSCs and also initiates a robust osteogenic differentiation program in adipose tissue-derived MSCs. To understand the molecular basis for these pronounced effects on osteogenic differentiation, we investigated global changes in gene expression in CytoD-treated murine and human MSCs by high-resolution RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. A three-way bioinformatic comparison between human adipose tissue-derived MSCs (hAMSCs), human bone marrow-derived MSCs (hBMSCs), and mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs (mBMSCs) revealed significant upregulation of genes linked to extracellular matrix organization, cell adhesion and bone metabolism. As anticipated, the activation of these differentiation-related genes is accompanied by a downregulation of nuclear and cell cycle-related genes presumably reflecting cytostatic effects of CytoD. We also identified eight novel CytoD activated genes-VGLL4, ARHGAP24, KLHL24, RCBTB2, BDH2, SCARF2, ACAD10, HEPH-which are commonly upregulated across the two species and tissue sources of our MSC samples. We selected the Hippo pathway-related VGLL4 gene, which encodes the transcriptional co-factor Vestigial-like 4, for further study because this pathway is linked to osteogenesis. VGLL4 small interfering RNA depletion reduces mineralization of hAMSCs during CytoD-induced osteogenic differentiation. Together, our RNA-seq analyses suggest that while the stimulatory effects of CytoD on osteogenesis are pleiotropic and depend on the biological state of the cell type, a small group of genes including VGLL4 may contribute to MSC commitment toward the bone lineage.",1
29882245,"ADAM28 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 28) is abundantly expressed by carcinoma cells in the human breast and non-small cell lung carcinomas, and plays a role in carcinoma cell growth and metastasis. Although Src is an inducer of ADAM28 gene expression through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways, direct transcriptional regulators for ADAM28 gene expression remain unknown. In this study, we performed the luciferase reporter assay and found that SOX4 (SRY-related HMG-box 4), an inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), is a transcriptional activator for the ADAM28 gene. This activation required the SOX4-binding consensus sequence at the 5'-untranslated region of the mouse and human ADAM28 genes. Forced expression of SOX4 promoted the ADAM28 gene expression and migration in human breast and lung carcinoma cell lines. In the human breast and lung carcinoma tissues, ADAM28 and SOX4 were co-expressed at the invasive front of carcinoma cell nests. Our data demonstrate that SOX4 transactivates ADAM28 gene expression through direct binding to the ADAM28 promoter region and suggest the possibility that ADAM28 plays a role in invasion through SOX4-mediated EMT in the human breast and lung carcinomas.",1

29875475,"Cannabis use is increasing in the United States, as are its adverse effects. We investigated the genetics of an adverse consequence of cannabis use: cannabis-related aggression (CRA) using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) design. Our GWAS sample included 3269 African Americans (AAs) and 2546 European Americans (EAs). An additional 89 AA subjects from the Grady Trauma Project (GTP) were also examined using a proxy-phenotype replication approach. We identified genome-wide significant risk loci contributing to CRA in AAs at the serotonin receptor 2B receptor gene (HTR2B), and the lead SNP, HTR2B*rs17440378, showed nominal association to aggression in the GTP cohort of cannabis-exposed subjects. A priori evidence linked HTR2B to impulsivity/aggression but not to cannabis response. Human functional data regarding the HTR2B variant further supported our finding. Treating an Htr2b<sup>-/-</sup> knockout mouse with THC resulted in increased aggressive behavior, whereas wild-type mice following THC administration showed decreased aggression in the resident-intruder paradigm, demonstrating that HTR2B variation moderates the effects of cannabis on aggression. These concordant findings in mice and humans implicate HTR2B as a major locus associated with cannabis-induced aggression.",1
29843236,"The pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) includes signaling defects mediated by the transforming growth factor β-bone morphogenetic protein-growth and differentiation factor (TGFβ-BMP-GDF) family of proteins. In animal models of AD, administration of BMP9/GDF2 improves memory and reduces amyloidosis. The best characterized type I receptor of BMP9 is ALK1. We characterized ALK1 expression in the hippocampus using immunohistochemistry. In the rat, ALK1 immunoreactivity was found in CA pyramidal neurons, most frequently and robustly in the CA2 and CA3 fields. In addition, there were sporadic ALK1-immunoreactive cells in the stratum oriens, mainly in CA1. The ALK1 expression pattern in human hippocampus was similar to that of rat. Pyramidal neurons within the CA2, CA3, and CA4 were strongly ALK1-immunoreactive in hippocampi of cognitively intact subjects with no neurofibrillary tangles. ALK1 signal was found in the axons of alveus and fimbria, and in the neuropil across CA fields. Relatively strongest ALK1 neuropil signal was observed in CA1 where pyramidal neurons were occasionally ALK1-immunoractive. As in the rat, horizontally oriented neurons in the stratum oriens of CA1 were both ALK1- and GAD67-immunoreactive. Analysis of ALK1 immunoreactivity across stages of AD pathology revealed that disease progression was characterized by overall reduction of the ALK1 signal in CA3 in advanced, but not early, stages of AD. These data suggest that the CA3 pyramidal neurons may remain responsive to the ALK1 ligands, e.g., BMP9, during initial stages of AD and that ALK1 may constitute a therapeutic target in early and moderate AD.",1
29794032,"Abhydrolase domain containing 16A (ABHD16A) is a member of the α/β hydrolase domain-containing (ABHD) protein family and is expressed in a variety of animal cells. Studies have shown that ABHD16A has acylglycerol lipase and phosphatidylserine lipase activities. Its gene location in the main histocompatibility complex (MHC) III gene cluster suggests that this protein may participate in the immunomodulation of the body. The results of studies investigating nearly 20 species of ABHDs reveal that the ABHD proteins are key factors in metabolic regulation and disease occurrence and development. In this paper, we summarize the related progress regarding the function of ABHD16A and other ABHD proteins. A prediction of the active sites and structural domains of ABHD16A and an analysis of the amino acid sites are included. Moreover, we analysed the amino acid sequences of the ABHD16A molecules in different species and provide an overview of the related functions and diseases associated with these proteins. The functions and diseases related to ABHD are systematically summarized and highlighted. Future research directions for studies investigating the functions and mechanisms of these proteins are also suggested. Further studies investigating the function of ABHD proteins may further confirm their positions as important determinants of lipid metabolism and related diseases.",1

29765501,"To clarify appropriateness of current claims for health and wellness virtues of argan oil, studies were conducted in inflammatory states. LPS induces inflammation with reduction of PGC1-<i>α</i> signaling and energy metabolism. Argan oil protected the liver against LPS toxicity and interestingly enough preservation of peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase type 1 (ACOX1) activity against depression by LPS. This model of LPS-driven toxicity circumvented by argan oil along with a key anti-inflammatory role attributed to ACOX1 has been here transposed to model aging. This view is consistent with known physiological role of ACOX1 in yielding precursors of specialized proresolving mediators (SPM) and with characteristics of aging and related disorders including reduced PGC1-<i>α</i> function and improvement by strategies rising ACOX1 (via hormonal gut FGF19 and nordihydroguaiaretic acid in metabolic syndrome and diabetes conditions) and SPM (neurodegenerative disorders, atherosclerosis, and stroke). Delay of aging to resolve inflammation results from altered production of SPM, SPM improving most aging disorders. The strategic metabolic place of ACOX1, upstream of SPM biosynthesis, along with ability of ACOX1 preservation/induction and SPM to improve aging-related disorders and known association of aging with drop in ACOX1 and SPM, all converge to conclude that ACOX1 represents a previously unsuspected and currently emerging antiaging protein.",1
29691896,"Although type 2 diabetes (T2D) results from metabolic defects in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, most of the genetic risk loci identified to date relates to insulin secretion. We reported that T2D loci influencing insulin sensitivity may be identified through interactions with insulin secretion loci, thereby leading to T2D. Here, we hypothesize that joint testing of variant main effects and interaction effects with an insulin secretion locus increases power to identify genetic interactions leading to T2D. We tested this hypothesis with an intronic MTNR1B SNP, rs10830963, which is associated with acute insulin response to glucose, a dynamic measure of insulin secretion. rs10830963 was tested for interaction and joint (main + interaction) effects with genome-wide data in African Americans (2,452 cases and 3,772 controls) from five cohorts. Genome-wide genotype data (Affymetrix Human Genome 6.0 array) was imputed to a 1000 Genomes Project reference panel. T2D risk was modeled using logistic regression with rs10830963 dosage, age, sex, and principal component as predictors. Joint effects were captured using the Kraft two degrees of freedom test. Genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup> ) interaction with MTNR1B and joint effects were detected for CMIP intronic SNP rs17197883 (P<sub>interaction </sub> = 1.43 × 10<sup>-8</sup> ; P<sub>joint </sub> = 4.70 × 10<sup>-8</sup> ). CMIP variants have been nominally associated with T2D, fasting glucose, and adiponectin in individuals of East Asian ancestry, with high-density lipoprotein, and with waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index in Europeans. These data support the hypothesis that additional genetic factors contributing to T2D risk, including insulin sensitivity loci, can be identified through interactions with insulin secretion loci.",1

29669287,"Although EZH2 enzymatic inhibitors have shown antitumor effects in EZH2-mutated lymphoma and ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer, many cancers do not respond because EZH2 can promote cancer independently of its histone methyltransferase activity. Here we identify ZRANB1 as the EZH2 deubiquitinase. ZRANB1 binds, deubiquitinates, and stabilizes EZH2. Depletion of ZRANB1 in breast cancer cells results in EZH2 destabilization and growth inhibition. Systemic delivery of ZRANB1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) leads to marked antitumor and antimetastatic effects in preclinical models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Intriguingly, a small-molecule inhibitor of ZRANB1 destabilizes EZH2 and inhibits the viability of TNBC cells. In patients with breast cancer, ZRANB1 levels correlate with EZH2 levels and poor survival. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential for targeting the EZH2 deubiquitinase ZRANB1.",1
29656986,"After the severe nuclear disaster in Fukushima, which was triggered by the Great East Japan earthquake in March 2011, nuclear power plants in Japan were temporarily shut down for mandatory inspections. To prevent large-scale blackouts, the Japanese government requested companies and households to reduce electricity consumption in summer and winter. It is reported that the domestic electricity demand had a structural decrease because of the electricity conservation effect (ECE). However, quantitative analysis of the ECE is not sufficient, and especially time variation of the ECE remains unclear. Understanding the ECE is important because Japan's NDC (nationally determined contribution) assumes the reduction of CO2 emissions through aggressive energy conservation. In this study, we develop a time series model of monthly electricity demand in Japan and estimate time variation of the ECE. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of electricity conservation on CO2 emissions from power plants. The dynamic linear model is used to separate the ECE from the effects of other irrelevant factors (e.g. air temperature, economic production, and electricity price). Our result clearly shows that consumers' electricity conservation behavior after the earthquake was not temporary but became established as a habit. Between March 2011 and March 2016, the ECE on industrial electricity demand ranged from 3.9% to 5.4%, and the ECE on residential electricity demand ranged from 1.6% to 7.6%. The ECE on the total electricity demand was estimated at 3.2%-6.0%. We found a seasonal pattern that the residential ECE in summer is higher than that in winter. The emissions increase from the shutdown of nuclear power plants was mitigated by electricity conservation. The emissions reduction effect was estimated at 0.82 MtCO2-2.26 MtCO2 (-4.5% on average compared to the zero-ECE case). The time-varying ECE is necessary for predicting Japan's electricity demand and CO2 emissions after the earthquake.",0
29649209,"Hybrid incompatibilities play a critical role in the evolution and maintenance of species. We have discovered a simple genetic incompatibility that causes lethality in hybrids between two closely related species of yellow monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus and M. nasutus). This hybrid incompatibility, which causes one sixteenth of F2 hybrid seedlings to lack chlorophyll and die shortly after germination, occurs between sympatric populations that are connected by ongoing interspecific gene flow. Using complimentary genetic mapping and gene expression analyses, we show that lethality occurs in hybrids that lack a functional copy of the critical photosynthetic gene pTAC14. In M. guttatus, this gene was duplicated, but the ancestral copy is no longer expressed. In M. nasutus, the duplication is missing altogether. As a result, hybrids die when they are homozygous for the nonfunctional M. guttatus copy and missing the duplicate from M. nasutus, apparently due to misregulated transcription of key photosynthetic genes. Our study indicates that neutral evolutionary processes may play an important role in the evolution of hybrid incompatibilities and opens the door to direct investigations of their contribution to reproductive isolation among naturally hybridizing species.",0

29632194,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) promotes lung cancer malignant progression. Here, we take advantage of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated somatic gene knockout in a <i>Kras</i><sup><i>G12D/</i>+</sup> mouse model to identify bona fide TSGs. From individual knockout of 55 potential TSGs, we identify five genes, including <i>Utx</i>, <i>Ptip</i>, <i>Acp5</i>, <i>Acacb</i>, and <i>Clu</i>, whose knockout significantly promotes lung tumorigenesis. These candidate genes are frequently down-regulated in human lung cancer specimens and significantly associated with survival in patients with lung cancer. Through crossing the conditional <i>Utx</i> knockout allele to the <i>Kras</i><sup><i>G12D/</i>+</sup> mouse model, we further find that <i>Utx</i> deletion dramatically promotes lung cancer progression. The tumor-promotive effect of <i>Utx</i> knockout in vivo is mainly mediated through an increase of the EZH2 level, which up-regulates the H3K27me3 level. Moreover, the <i>Utx</i>-knockout lung tumors are preferentially sensitive to EZH2 inhibitor treatment. Collectively, our study provides a systematic screening of TSGs in vivo and identifies UTX as an important epigenetic regulator in lung tumorigenesis.",1
29617667,"Hotspot mutations in splicing factor genes have been recently reported at high frequency in hematological malignancies, suggesting the importance of RNA splicing in cancer. We analyzed whole-exome sequencing data across 33 tumor types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and we identified 119 splicing factor genes with significant non-silent mutation patterns, including mutation over-representation, recurrent loss of function (tumor suppressor-like), or hotspot mutation profile (oncogene-like). Furthermore, RNA sequencing analysis revealed altered splicing events associated with selected splicing factor mutations. In addition, we were able to identify common gene pathway profiles associated with the presence of these mutations. Our analysis suggests that somatic alteration of genes involved in the RNA-splicing process is common in cancer and may represent an underappreciated hallmark of tumorigenesis.",1

29593124,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy specific disease with several risk factors such as genetic polymorphisms, environmental and social factors participating in its development. The aim of this study was to investigate whether distribution of three putative regulatory SNPs rs13430086, rs5186, rs4606 in 3'UTR of genes ACVR2A, AGTR1 and RGS2, respectively, that have been associated with hypertension and regulation of trophoblast invasion differ between women with PE and control group. The associations of rs13430086, rs5186 and rs4606 with preeclampsia were tested in two groups - the group of 50 women with PE and the control group of 42 healthy pregnant women at term. DNA was isolated from blood samples and the determination of genotypes was performed using Real-Time PCR. Power analysis for the size of the cohort was performed and the results were analyzed using Fisher exact test.

29584636,"Plant secondary metabolites (SMs) are not only a useful array of natural products but also an important part of plant defense system against pathogenic attacks and environmental stresses. With remarkable biological activities, plant SMs are increasingly used as medicine ingredients and food additives for therapeutic, aromatic and culinary purposes. Various genetic, ontogenic, morphogenetic and environmental factors can influence the biosynthesis and accumulation of SMs. According to the literature reports, for example, SMs accumulation is strongly dependent on a variety of environmental factors such as light, temperature, soil water, soil fertility and salinity, and for most plants, a change in an individual factor may alter the content of SMs even if other factors remain constant. Here, we review with emphasis how each of single factors to affect the accumulation of plant secondary metabolites, and conduct a comparative analysis of relevant natural products in the stressed and unstressed plants. Expectantly, this documentary review will outline a general picture of environmental factors responsible for fluctuation in plant SMs, provide a practical way to obtain consistent quality and high quantity of bioactive compounds in vegetation, and present some suggestions for future research and development.",0
29570232,"STX2 encodes a sulfoglycolipid transporter. Although Stx2 nullizygosity is known to cause spermatogenic failure in mice, STX2 mutations have not been identified in humans. Here, we performed STX2 mutation analysis for 131 Japanese men clinically diagnosed with nonobstructive azoospermia. As a result, we identified a homozygous frameshift mutation [c.8_12delACCGG, p.(Asp3Alafs*8)] in one patient. The mutation-positive patient exhibited loss-of-heterozygosity for 58.4 Mb genomic regions involving STX2, suggesting possible parental consanguinity. The patient showed azoospermia, relatively small testes, and a mildly elevated follicle stimulating hormone level, but no additional clinical features. Testicular histology of the patient showed universal maturation arrest and multinucleated spermatocytes, which have also been observed in mice lacking Stx2. PCR-based cDNA screening revealed wildtype STX2 expression in various tissues including the testis. Our results indicate that STX2 nullizygosity results in nonsyndromic maturation arrest with multinucleated spermatocytes, and accounts for a small fraction of cases with nonobstructive azoospermia.",1
29566793,"To identify novel genes associated with ALS, we undertook two lines of investigation. We carried out a genome-wide association study comparing 20,806 ALS cases and 59,804 controls. Independently, we performed a rare variant burden analysis comparing 1,138 index familial ALS cases and 19,494 controls. Through both approaches, we identified kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) as a novel gene associated with ALS. Interestingly, mutations predominantly in the N-terminal motor domain of KIF5A are causative for two neurodegenerative diseases: hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG10) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 (CMT2). In contrast, ALS-associated mutations are primarily located at the C-terminal cargo-binding tail domain and patients harboring loss-of-function mutations displayed an extended survival relative to typical ALS cases. Taken together, these results broaden the phenotype spectrum resulting from mutations in KIF5A and strengthen the role of cytoskeletal defects in the pathogenesis of ALS.",1
29563502,"Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, occurs in 0.3-2% of pregnancies and is associated with maternal and fetal morbidity.

Here, we conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for binary (HG) and ordinal (severity of nausea and vomiting) phenotypes of pregnancy complications. Two loci, chr19p13.11 and chr4q12, are genome-wide significant (p < 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) in both association scans and are replicated in an independent cohort. The genes implicated at these two loci are GDF15 and IGFBP7 respectively, both known to be involved in placentation, appetite, and cachexia.

Amongst them, CXCR7, also known as atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3), was suggested as a coreceptor candidate capable of facilitating both HIV-1 and HIV-2 entry <i>in vitro</i>. In this study, a cellular infection model was established to further decipher the role of CXCR7 as an HIV coreceptor. Using this model, CXCR7-mediated viral entry was demonstrated for several clinical HIV isolates as well as laboratory strains. Of interest, the X4-tropic HIV-1 HE strain showed rapid adaptation towards CXCR7-mediated infection after continuous passaging on CD4- and CXCR7-expressing cells. Furthermore, we uncovered anti-CXCR7 monoclonal antibodies, small molecule CXCR7 inhibitors and the natural CXCR7 chemokine ligands as potent inhibitors of CXCR7 receptor-mediated HIV entry and replication. Even though the clinical relevance of CXCR7-mediated HIV infection remains poorly understood, our data suggest that divergent HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains can quickly adapt their coreceptor usage depending on the cellular environment, which warrants further investigation.",1
29550974,"A disintegrin and a metalloprotease (ADAM) 9 is a metzincin cell-surface protease involved in several biological processes such as myogenesis, fertilization, cell migration, inflammatory response, proliferation, and cell-cell interactions. ADAM9 has been found over-expressed in several solid tumors entities such as glioma, melanoma, prostate cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, gastric, breast, lung, and liver cancers. Immunohistochemical analyses highlight ADAM9 expression by actual cancer cells and associate its abundant presence with clinicopathological features such as shortened overall survival, poor tumor grade, de-differentiation, therapy resistance, and metastasis formation. In each of these tumors, ADAM9 may contribute to tumor biology via proteolytic or non-proteolytic mechanisms. For example, in liver cancer, ADAM9 has been found to shed MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A, contributing towards the evasion of tumor immunity. ADAM9 may also contribute to tumor biology in non-proteolytic ways probably through interaction with different integrins. For example, in melanoma, the interaction between ADAM9 and β1 integrins facilitates tumor stroma cross talks, which then promotes invasion and metastasis via the activation of MMP1 and MMP2. In breast cancer, the interaction between β1 integrins on endothelial cells and ADAM9 on tumor cells facilitate tumor cell extravasation and invasion to distant sites. This review summarizes the present knowledge on ADAM9 in solid cancers, and the different mechanisms which it employ to drive tumor progression.",1
29535761,"<b>Background:</b> It is widely accepted that cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) results from the complex interplay between multiple genetic and environmental factors. However, a robust investigation of these gene-environment (GxE) interactions at a genome-wide level is still lacking for isolated CL/P. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> We used our R-package Haplin to perform a genome-wide search for GxE effects in isolated CL/P. From a previously published GWAS, genotypes and information on maternal periconceptional cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and vitamin use were available on 1908 isolated CL/P triads of predominantly European or Asian ancestry. A GxE effect is present if the relative risk estimates for gene-effects in the offspring are different across exposure strata. We tested this using the relative risk ratio (RRR). Besides analyzing all ethnicities combined (""pooled analysis""), separate analyses were conducted on Europeans and Asians to investigate ethnicity-specific effects. To control for multiple testing, <i>q</i>-values were calculated from the <i>p</i>-values. <b>Results:</b> We identified significant GxVitamin interactions with three SNPs in ""Estrogen-related receptor gamma"" (<i>ESRRG</i>) in the pooled analysis. The RRRs (95% confidence intervals) were 0.56 (0.45-0.69) with rs1339221 (<i>q</i> = 0.011), 0.57 (0.46-0.70) with rs11117745 (<i>q</i> = 0.011), and 0.62 (0.50-0.76) with rs2099557 (<i>q</i> = 0.037). The associations were stronger when these SNPs were analyzed as haplotypes composed of two-SNP and three-SNP combinations. The strongest effect was with the ""t-t-t"" haplotype of the rs1339221-rs11117745-rs2099557 combination [RRR = 0.50 (0.40-0.64)], suggesting that the effects observed with the other SNP combinations, including those in the single-SNP analyses, were mainly driven by this haplotype. Although there were potential GxVitamin effects with rs17734557 and rs1316471 and GxAlcohol effects with rs9653456 and rs921876 in the European sample, respectively, none of the SNPs was located in or near genes with strong links to orofacial clefts. GxAlcohol and GxSmoke effects were not assessed in the Asian sample because of a lack of observations for these exposures. <b>Discussion/Conclusion:</b> We identified significant interactions between vitamin use and variants in <i>ESRRG</i> in the pooled analysis. These GxE effects are novel and warrant further investigations to elucidate their roles in orofacial clefting. If validated, they could provide prospects for exploring the impact of estrogens and vitamins on clefting, with potential translational applications.",1
29534301,"Approximately 5-10% of individuals who are vaccinated with a hepatitis B (HB) vaccine designed based on the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype C fail to acquire protective levels of antibodies. Here, host genetic factors behind low immune response to this HB vaccine were investigated by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) association tests. The GWAS and HLA association tests were carried out using a total of 1,193 Japanese individuals including 107 low responders, 351 intermediate responders, and 735 high responders. Classical HLA class II alleles were statistically imputed using the genome-wide SNP typing data. The GWAS identified independent associations of HLA-DRB1-DQB1, HLA-DPB1 and BTNL2 genes with immune response to a HB vaccine designed based on the HBV genotype C. Five HLA-DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes and two DPB1 alleles showed significant associations with response to the HB vaccine in a comparison of three groups of 1,193 HB vaccinated individuals. When frequencies of DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes and DPB1 alleles were compared between low immune responders and HBV patients, significant associations were identified for three DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes, and no association was identified for any of the DPB1 alleles. In contrast, no association was identified for DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes and DPB1 alleles in a comparison between high immune responders and healthy individuals.",1
29518376,"Neural basic helix-loop helix (bHLH) transcription factors promote progenitor cell differentiation by activation of downstream target genes that coordinate neuronal differentiation. Here we characterize a neural bHLH target gene in Xenopus laevis, vexin (vxn; previously sbt1), that is homologous to human c8orf46 and is conserved across vertebrate species. C8orf46 has been implicated in cancer progression, but its function is unknown. Vxn is transiently expressed in differentiating progenitors in the developing central nervous system (CNS), and is required for neurogenesis in the neural plate and retina. Its function is conserved, since overexpression of either Xenopus or mouse vxn expands primary neurogenesis and promotes early retinal cell differentiation in cooperation with neural bHLH factors. Vxn protein is localized to the cell membrane and the nucleus, but functions in the nucleus to promote neural differentiation. Vxn inhibits cell proliferation, and works with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Xic1 (cdkn1b) to enhance neurogenesis and increase levels of the proneural protein Neurog2. We propose that vxn provides a key link between neural bHLH activity and execution of the neurogenic program.",1
29518117,"Osteoporosis has a complex etiology and is considered a multifactorial polygenic disease, in which genetic determinants are modulated by hormonal, lifestyle, environmental, and nutritional factors. Therefore, investigating these multiple factors, and the interactions between them, might lead to a better understanding of osteoporosis pathogenesis, and possible therapeutic interventions. The objective of this study was to identify the relationship between three blood metals (Pb, Cd, and Al), in smoking and nonsmoking patients' sera, and prevalence of osteoporosis. In particular, we focused on gene-environment interactions of metal exposure, including a dataset obtained through genome-wide association study (GWAS). Subsequently, we conducted a pathway-based analysis, using a GWAS dataset, to elucidate how metal exposure influences susceptibility to osteoporosis. In this study, we evaluated blood metal exposures for estimating the prevalence of osteoporosis in 443 participants (aged 53.24 ± 8.29), from the Republic of Korea. Those analyses revealed a negative association between lead blood levels and bone mineral density in current smokers (p trend <0.01). By further using GWAS-based pathway analysis, we found nuclear receptor (FDR<0.05) and VEGF pathways (FDR<0.05) to be significantly upregulated by blood lead burden, with regard to the prevalence of osteoporosis, in current smokers. These findings suggest that the intracellular pathways of angiogenesis and nuclear hormonal signaling can modulate interactions between lead exposure and genetic variation, with regard to susceptibility to diminished bone mineral density. Our findings may provide new leads for understanding the mechanisms underlying the development of osteoporosis, including possible interventions.",1
29516011,"Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Recent studies have highlighted the role of miRNA in disease pathology, indicating its potential use as an early diagnostic marker. Dysregulated expression of miRNAs is known to affect cell growth, and these may function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes in various cancers. The main objective of this study was to characterize the extracellular miRNAs involved in <i>oral cancer</i> (OC) that can potentially be used as biomarkers of OC. A total of 318 miRNAs involved in oral carcinoma were shortlisted. <i>Differentially expressed genes</i> (DEGs) of oral carcinoma from reported experiments were identified. Common genes between lists of DEGs of OC of each miRNA were identified. These common genes are the targets of specific miRNA, which may be used as biomarkers of OC. A list of significant biomarkers for cancer was generated like CDH2 and CDK7, and functional enrichment analysis identified the role of miRNAs in major pathways like cell adhesion molecules pathway affected by cancer. We observed that at least 25 genes like <i>ABCF3</i>, <i>ALDH2</i>, <i>CD163L1</i>, and so forth are regulated by a maximum number of miRNAs; thereby, they can be used as biomarkers of OC.",1
29511167,"Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is a common and life-threatening heart disease and the current treatment options cannot stop or delay its progression. A GWAS on 1009 cases and 1017 ethnically matched controls was combined with a large-scale eQTL mapping study of human aortic valve tissues (n = 233) to identify susceptibility genes for CAVS. Replication was performed in the UK Biobank, including 1391 cases and 352,195 controls. A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) reveals PALMD (palmdelphin) as significantly associated with CAVS. The CAVS risk alleles and increasing disease severity are both associated with decreased mRNA expression levels of PALMD in valve tissues. The top variant identified shows a similar effect and strong association with CAVS (P = 1.53 × 10<sup>-10</sup>) in UK Biobank. The identification of PALMD as a susceptibility gene for CAVS provides insights into the genetic nature of this disease, opens avenues to investigate its etiology and to develop much-needed therapeutic options.",1
29493120,"Cholesterol affects cancer progression, and acetyl-CoA is the primary cholesterogenesis substrate. The previous work has defined cholesterol bioflux via lipoprotein/receptor route is the gastric cancer (GCa) prognosis biosignature. The prognosis importance of acetyl-CoA to cholesterogenesis (mevalonate pathway) in GCa is yet to be defined. Using Kaplan-Meier Plotter web-based gene survival analyzer and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-database analyzed with DBdriver.v2 platform, we revealed acetyl-CoA production and the mevalonate pathway are associated with GCa prognosis. We found mitochondrial-derived acetyl-CoA contributing enzymes (acyl-coA synthetase super-family 3; ACSS3) is the GCa progression confounder. Interestingly, it is not HMGCR (the committee enzyme of mevalonate pathway), but lower mevalonate pathway enzymes (e.g., MVK, LSS, DHCR14A1, SC4MOL, HSD17B7, SC5D) promote GCa patients 5-years overall survival in a differential level. Advanced analyses found ACSS3 is prognosis biosignatures for multiple GCa disease conditions. This report uncovered a higher expression of ACSS3 in tumor comparing to normal parental lesions, which implicates a targeting value for GCa therapy. While knockdown ACSS3 could suppress growth and invasion of GCa cells, of which even more impactful under starvation condition. This is the first report, surprisingly, revealed ACSS3 as important cancer prognosis biomarker. Targeting ACSS3 could be a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer, in this case, GCa.",1
29491472,"Clinical research in coronary artery disease (CAD) primarily focused on genetic variants located in protein-coding regions. Recently, mutations fall within non-coding regions have been suggested to be essential to the pathogenesis of human complex disease. Super enhancer is a densely spaced cluster of transcriptional enhancers located in non-coding regions, which is critical for regulating cell-type specific gene expression. However, the underlying mechanism of the super enhancer single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting the risk of CAD remains unclear. By integrating genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of CAD and cell/tissue-specific histone modification data set, we identified 366 potential CAD-associated super enhancer SNPs in 67 loci, including 94 SNPs that are involved in regulating chromatin interactive and/or affecting the transcription factors binding affinity. Interestingly, we found 7 novel functional loci (CBFA2T3, ZMIZ1, DIP2B, SCNN1D/ACAP3, TMEM105, CAMK2G, and MAPK1) that CAD-associated super enhancer SNPs were clustered into the same or neighboring super enhancers. Pathway analysis showed a significant enrichment in several well-known signaling and regulatory processes, e.g., cAMP signaling pathway and ErbB signaling pathway, which play a key role in CAD metabolism. Our results highlight the potential functional importance of CAD-associated super enhancer SNPs and provide the targets for further insights on the pathogenesis of CAD.",1

29466493,"In recent years, many publications in scientific journals have reported, in healthy volunteers, potential food-drug or drug-drug interactions. The lay press has frequently emphasized such interactions and extrapolated on the dangers of food-drug or drug-drug interactions. However, the clinical relevancy of these interactions has not always been substantiated in patients. The aim of the present review was to assess the clinical relevancy of drug-drug interactions occurring at the level of the biotransformation of the drug. For this purpose, the incidence of serious, life-threatening adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of drugs metabolized by different enzymes of cytochrome P450 found in the safety reports issued in megatrials were compared with those from placebo trials. It was concluded that serious ADRs secondary to drug-drug interactions are infrequent; drug-drug interactions including selected drugs with a narrow therapeutic index and eliciting life-threatening undesired effects occur; and serious ADRs secondary to drug-drug interactions are most frequent in elderly patients, in the presence of polypharmacy, in the psychiatric patient population, and in the presence of inappropriate prescriptions and of multiple prescriptors.",0
29460904,"The removal of antibiotics is crucial for improvement of water quality in animal wastewater treatment. In this paper, the performance of microbial fuel cell (MFC) in terms of degradation of typical antibiotics was investigated. Electricity was successfully produced by using sludge supernatant mixtures and synthesized animal wastewater as inoculation in MFC. Results demonstrated that the stable voltage, the maximum power density and internal resistance of anaerobic self-electrolysis (ASE) -112 and ASE-116 without antibiotics addition were 0.574 V, 5.78 W m<sup>-3</sup> and 28.06 Ω, and 0.565 V, 5.82 W m<sup>-3</sup> and 29.38 Ω, respectively. Moreover, when adding aureomycin, sulfadimidine, roxithromycin and norfloxacin into the reactors, the performance of MFC was inhibited (0.51 V-0.41 V), while the output voltage was improved with the decreased concentration of antibiotics. However, the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen (NH<sub>3</sub>-N) and total phosphorus (TP) were both obviously enhanced. Simultaneously, LC-MS analysis showed that the removal efficiency of aureomycin, roxithromycin and norfloxacin were all 100% and the removal efficiency of sulfadimidine also reached 99.9%. These results indicated that antibiotics displayed significantly inhibitions for electricity performance but improved the quality of water simultaneously.",0
29459674,"Prognosis identifies the seriousness and the chances of survival of a cancer patient. However, it remains a challenge to identify the key cancer genes in prognostic studies. In this study, we collected 2064 genes that were related to prognostic studies by using gene expression measurements curated from published literatures. Among them, 1820 genes were associated with copy number variations (CNVs). The further functional enrichment on 889 genes with frequent copy number gains (CNGs) revealed that these genes were significantly associated with cancer pathways including regulation of cell cycle, cell differentiation and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. We further conducted integrative analyses of CNV and their target genes expression using the data from matched tumour samples of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Ultimately, 95 key prognosis-related genes were extracted, with concordant CNG events and increased up-regulation in at least 300 tumour samples. These genes, and the number of samples in which they were found, included: ACTL6A (399), ATP6V1C1 (425), EBAG9 (412), FADD (308), MTDH (377), and SENP5 (304). This study provides the first observation of CNV in prognosis-related genes across pan-cancer. The systematic concordance between CNG and up-regulation of gene expression in these novel prognosis-related genes may indicate their prognostic significance.",1

29436628,"The present study aimed to examine the universal gene expression signature and the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of carotid atherosclerotic plaques. The gene expression dataset, GSE28829, containing 13 early and 16 advanced carotid atherosclerotic plaques was selected for analysis. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and analyzed using bioinformatics analyses, including cluster analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses. Finally, a protein‑protein interaction (PPI) was constructed and analyzed. A total of 515 downregulated and 243 downregulated DEGs were identified. The cluster analysis revealed two separate two groups. In addition, the GO terms enriched by the upregulated DEGs were associated with immune response, and the downregulated DEGs were associated with cell adhesion. The upregulated DEGs were enriched in pathways associated with signaling in the immune system, and the downregulated DEGs were enriched in pathways associated with muscle contraction. In the PPI network analysis, ITGAM and ACTN2 had the highest decrees of connectivity in the upregulated and downregulated DEGs, respectively. These findings suggested that deregulation of the immune system and smooth muscle cell cytoskeleton accelerates the progression of carotid atherosclerotic plaques. The DEGs identified may offer potential in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis in the carotid artery.",1
29435122,"APOBEC enzymes are responsible for a mutation signature (TCW>T/G) implicated in a wide variety of tumors. We explore the APOBEC mutational signature in bladder cancer and the relationship with specific mutations, molecular subtype, gene expression, and survival using sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (<i>n</i> = 395), Beijing Genomics Institute (<i>n</i> = 99), and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Tumors were split into ""APOBEC-high"" and ""APOBEC-low"" based on APOBEC enrichment. Patients with APOBEC-high tumors have better overall survival compared to those with APOBEC-low tumors (38.2 vs. 18.5 months, <i>p</i> = 0.005). APOBEC-high tumors are more likely to have mutations in DNA damage response genes (<i>TP53, ATR, BRCA2</i>) and chromatin regulatory genes (<i>ARID1A, MLL, MLL3</i>), while APOBEC-low tumors are more likely to have mutations in <i>FGFR3</i> and <i>KRAS</i>. <i>APOBEC3A</i> and <i>APOBEC3B</i> expression correlates with mutation burden, regardless of bladder tumor molecular subtype. APOBEC mutagenesis is associated with increased expression of immune signatures, including interferon signaling, and expression of <i>APOBEC3B</i> is increased after stimulation of APOBEC-high bladder cancer cell lines with IFNγ. In summary, APOBEC-high tumors are more likely to have mutations in DNA damage response and chromatin regulatory genes, potentially providing more substrate for APOBEC enzymes, leading to a hypermutational phenotype and the subsequent enhanced immune response.",1

29427275,"Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) have the unique ability to produce magnetic particles surrounded by a biomembrane to form the magnetosome organelle. Therefore, MTB have novel physical and magnetic properties and have consequently been used in several biotechnological applications. The magnetic properties of these micro-organisms and their magnetosomes have, however, never been used for the generation of electricity as described in this letter. Comparisons were made between, firstly, the electricity generated from purified magnetosomes, MTB culture (bacterial cells with magnetosomes) and sterile, liquid growth medium (control). Secondly, the electricity generated by a dilution series of purified magnetosomes were compared. A statistically significant difference was found between the voltage measured from the purified magnetosomes (highest voltage), MTB culture (lower voltage) and liquid growth medium (lowest voltage). In the dilution series, the voltage measured increased as the magnetosome concentration increased, but only up to an optimum concentration (0·0376 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> ). In this study, we have demonstrated that a significantly higher voltage than that of the control could be measured when MTB or purified magnetosomes were pumped through a solenoid by applying Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.",0
29406104,"The Cambrian Explosion is one of the most significant events in the history of life; essentially all easily fossilizable animal body plans first evolved during this event. Although many theories have been proposed to explain this event, its cause remains unresolved. Here, we propose that the elevated level of oxygen, in combination with the increased mobility and food intake of metazoans, led to increased cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which drove evolution by enhancing mutation rates and providing new regulatory mechanisms. Our hypothesis may provide a unified explanation for the Cambrian Explosion as it incorporates both environmental and developmental factors and is also consistent with ecological explanations for animal radiation. Future studies should focus on testing this hypothesis, and may lead to important insights into evolution.",0
29404214,"Plasma lipid levels are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death worldwide. While many studies have been conducted on lipid genetics, they mainly focus on Europeans and thus their transferability to diverse populations is unclear. We performed SNP- and gene-level genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of four lipid traits in cohorts from Nigeria and the Philippines and compared them to the results of larger, predominantly European meta-analyses. Two previously implicated loci met genome-wide significance in our SNP-level GWAS in the Nigerian cohort, rs34065661 in <i>CETP</i> associated with HDL cholesterol (<i>P</i> = 9.0 × 10<sup>-10</sup>) and rs1065853 upstream of <i>APOE</i> associated with LDL cholesterol (<i>P</i> = 6.6 × 10<sup>-9</sup>).

While this SNP is located directly upstream of well known <i>APOA5</i>, we show it may also be involved in the regulation of <i>BACE1</i> and <i>SIDT2</i>. Our gene-based association analysis, PrediXcan, revealed decreased expression of <i>BACE1</i> and decreased expression of <i>SIDT2</i> in several tissues, all driven by rs662799, significantly associate with increased triglyceride levels in Filipinos (FDR <0.1). In addition, our PrediXcan analysis implicated gene regulation as the mechanism underlying the associations of many other previously discovered lipid loci.

29398278,"Chemokines are named and best known for their chemotactic cytokine activity in the hematopoietic system; however, their importance extends far beyond leukocytes, cell movement and immunoregulation. CXCL12, the most protean of chemokines, regulates development in multiple systems, including the hematopoietic, cardiovascular and nervous systems, and regulates diverse cell functions, including differentiation, distribution, activation, immune synapse formation, effector function, proliferation and survival in the immune system alone. The broad importance of CXCL12 is revealed by the complex lethal developmental phenotypes in mice lacking either Cxcl12 or either one of its two known 7-transmembrane domain receptors Cxcr4 and Ackr3, as well as by gain-of-function mutations in human CXCR4, which cause WHIM syndrome, a multisystem and combined immunodeficiency disease and the only Mendelian condition caused by a chemokine system mutation. In addition, wild type CXCR4 is important in the pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS and cancer. Thus, CXCL12 and its receptors CXCR4 and ACKR3 provide extraordinary examples of multisystem multitasking in the chemokine system in both health and disease.",1
29397421,"The most prevalent neurological disorders of myelin include perinatal brain injury leading to cerebral palsy in infants and multiple sclerosis in adults. Although these disorders have distinct etiologies, they share a common neuropathological feature of failed progenitor differentiation into myelin-producing oligodendrocytes and lack of myelin, for which there is an unmet clinical need. Here, we reveal that a molecular pathology common to both disorders is dysregulation of activin receptors and that activin receptor signaling is required for the majority of myelin generation in development and following injury. Using a constitutive conditional knockout of all activin receptor signaling in oligodendrocyte lineage cells, we discovered this signaling to be required for myelination via regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin compaction. These processes were found to be dependent on the activin receptor subtype Acvr2a, which is expressed during oligodendrocyte differentiation and axonal ensheathment in development and following myelin injury. During efficient myelin regeneration, Acvr2a upregulation was seen to coincide with downregulation of Acvr2b, a receptor subtype with relatively higher ligand affinity; Acvr2b was shown to be dispensable for activin receptor-driven oligodendrocyte differentiation and its overexpression was sufficient to impair the abovementioned ligand-driven responses. In actively myelinating or remyelinating areas of human perinatal brain injury and multiple sclerosis tissue, respectively, oligodendrocyte lineage cells expressing Acvr2a outnumbered those expressing Acvr2b, whereas in non-repairing lesions Acvr2b+ cells were increased. Thus, we propose that following human white matter injury, this increase in Acvr2b expression would sequester ligand and consequently impair Acvr2a-driven oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation. Our results demonstrate dysregulated activin receptor signaling in common myelin disorders and reveal Acvr2a as a novel therapeutic target for myelin generation following injury across the lifespan.",1
29396028,"Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are genetic defects in the glycoconjugate biosynthesis. >100 types of CDG are known, most of them cause multi-organ diseases. Here we describe a boy whose leading symptoms comprise cutis laxa, pancreatic insufficiency and hepatosplenomegaly. Whole exome sequencing identified the novel hemizygous mutation c.542T>G (p.L181R) in the X-linked ATP6AP1, an accessory protein of the mammalian vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, which led to a general N-glycosylation deficiency. Studies of serum N-glycans revealed reduction of complex sialylated and appearance of truncated diantennary structures. Proliferation of the patient's fibroblasts was significantly reduced and doubling time prolonged. Additionally, there were alterations in the fibroblasts' amino acid levels and the acylcarnitine composition. Especially, short-chain species were reduced, whereas several medium- to long-chain acylcarnitines (C14-OH to C18) were elevated. Investigation of the main lipid classes revealed that total cholesterol was significantly enriched in the patient's fibroblasts at the expense of phophatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Within the minor lipid species, hexosylceramide was reduced, while its immediate precursor ceramide was increased. Since catalase activity and ACOX3 expression in peroxisomes were reduced, we assume an ATP6AP1-dependent impact on the β-oxidation of fatty acids. These results help to understand the complex clinical characteristics of this new patient.",1
29391887,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Although the clinical success rate for the treatment of early-stage HCC has improved, the prognosis of advanced HCC remains poor owing to the high recurrence rate and the refractory nature of HCC for various anticancer drugs. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of HCC is therefore critically needed in order to treat HCC, including its genetic alterations. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has provided an unbiased platform to systematically identify gene mutations and reveal the pathogenesis of various cancers. In the present study, a total of 118 samples (59 liver tissues including cancer and adjacent normal tissues) were sequenced using the AmpliSeq Hotspot Cancer Panel (version 2). The most common somatic mutations identified were tumor protein 53 (<i>TP53</i>; 35.6%) and β-catenin 1 (<i>CTNNB1</i>; 30.5%), and the most frequent variants of those genes were missense variants. In addition, somatic mutations including those in genes encoding colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (5.1%), epidermal growth factor receptor (6.8%), <i>RET</i> proto-oncogene (3.4%), Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (<i>ERBB4</i>; 1.7%) and serine/threonine kinase 11 (<i>STK11</i>, also known as liver kinase B1; 6.8%) were also identified at a low frequency in patients with HCC. A frameshift variant in <i>STK11</i>, a splice acceptor variant in <i>TP53</i>, a splice region variant in <i>ERBB4</i> and a stop-gained variant in <i>TP53</i> were also specifically determined. The most abundant alteration was a C:G>T:A transition (50%) and other transversions, i.e., C:G>G:C (19.6%), T:A>C:G (19.6%), C:G>A:T (12.5%), T:A>G:C (12.5%) and T:A>A:T (5.4%). This spectrum pattern differs from that in other solid tumors. <i>TP53</i> mutations in the tumors at advanced stages were significantly more frequent compared with those in early-stage tumors. Additionally, age (<70 vs. ≥70 years) was significantly associated with <i>CTNNB1</i> mutations. Using NGS, a number of novel gene mutations were identified in HCC, including established mutations and disproved mutations. The results of the present study offer new insight and improved understanding of the etiology and the development of HCC.",1

The ARDL bounds test for cointegration in addition to the Bayer-Hanck (2013) combined cointegration test is applied to analyse the existence of cointegration among the variables. The study found strong evidence of a long-run relationship between the variables. The long-run results under the ARDL framework confirm the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between financial development and electricity consumption, not only in the long-run, but also in the short-run. The study also confirms the existence of a U-shaped relationship between Internet usage and electricity consumption; however, the effect is insignificant. Additionally, the influence of trade, capital and economic growth is examined in both the long run and short run (ARDL-ECM). Finally, the results of asymmetric causality suggest a positive shock in electricity consumption that has a positive causal impact on Internet usage. The authors recommend that the Turkish Government should direct financial institutions to moderate the investment in the ICT sector by advancing credits at lower cost for purchasing energy-efficient technologies. In doing so, the Turkish Government can increase productivity in order to achieve sustainable growth, while simultaneously reducing emissions to improve environmental quality.",0
29353061,"Overlapping morphologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural features make it difficult to diagnose chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC) and renal oncocytoma (RO). Because ChRCC is a malignant tumor, whereas RO is a tumor with benign behavior, it is important to distinguish these two entities. We aimed to identify genetic markers that distinguish ChRCC from RO by using next-generation sequencing (NGS). NGS for hotspot mutations or gene copy number changes was performed on 12 renal neoplasms, including seven ChRCC and five RO cases. Matched normal tissues from the same patients were used to exclude germline variants. Rare hotspot mutations were found in cancer-critical genes (TP53 and PIK3CA) in ChRCC but not RO. The NGS gene copy number analysis revealed multiple abnormalities. The two most common deletions were tumor-suppressor genes RB1 and ERBB4 in ChRCC but not RO. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on 65 cases (ChRCC, n = 33; RO, n = 32) to verify hemizygous deletion of RB1 (17/33, 52%) or ERBB4 (11/33, 33%) in ChRCC, but not in RO (0/32, 0%). In total, ChRCCs (23/33, 70%) carry either a hemizygous deletion of RB1 or ERBB4. The combined use of RB1 and ERBB4 fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect deletion of these genes may offer a highly sensitive and specific assay to distinguish ChRCC from RO.",1
29346730,"Nowadays, bio-reliable modeling of muscle contraction is becoming more accurate and complex. This increasing complexity induces a significant increase in computation time which prevents the possibility of using this model in certain applications and studies. Accordingly, the aim of this work is to significantly reduce the computation time of high-density surface electromyogram (HD-sEMG) generation. This will be done through a new model of motor unit (MU)-specific electrical source based on the fibers composing the MU. In order to assess the efficiency of this approach, we computed the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) between several simulations on single generated MU action potential (MUAP) using the usual fiber electrical sources and the MU-specific electrical source. This NRMSE was computed for five different simulation sets wherein hundreds of MUAPs are generated and summed into HD-sEMG signals. The obtained results display less than 2% error on the generated signals compared to the same signals generated with fiber electrical sources. Moreover, the computation time of the HD-sEMG signal generation model is reduced to about 90% compared to the fiber electrical source model. Using this model with MU electrical sources, we can simulate HD-sEMG signals of a physiological muscle (hundreds of MU) in less than an hour on a classical workstation. Graphical Abstract Overview of the simulation of HD-sEMG signals using the fiber scale and the MU scale. Upscaling the electrical source to the MU scale reduces the computation time by 90% inducing only small deviation of the same simulated HD-sEMG signals.",0
29322354,"The association between mutations of key driver genes and colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis has been investigated by many studies. However, the results of these studies have been contradictory. Here, we perform a comprehensive analysis to screen key driver genes from the TCGA database and validate the roles of these mutations in CRC metastasis. Using bioinformatics analysis, we identified six key driver genes, namely APC, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, SMAD4 and p53. Through a systematic search, 120 articles published by November 30, 2017, were included, which all showed roles for these gene mutations in CRC metastasis. A meta-analysis showed that KRAS mutations (combined OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05-1.33) and p53 mutations (combined OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.23-1.80) were associated with CRC metastasis, including lymphatic and distant metastases. Moreover, CRC patients with a KRAS mutation (combined OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.13-1.47), p53 mutation (combined OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06-1.72) or SMAD4 mutation (combined OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.41-2.95) were at a higher risk of distant metastasis. Subgroup analysis stratified by ethnic populations indicated that the BRAF mutation was related to CRC metastasis (combined OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.18-1.71) and distant metastasis (combined OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.20-1.91) in an Asian population. No significant association was found between mutations of APC or PIK3CA and CRC metastasis. In conclusion, mutations of KRAS, p53, SMAD4 and BRAF play significant roles in CRC metastasis and may be both potential biomarkers of CRC metastasis as well as therapeutic targets.",1
29315502,"Hair provides a direct measure of long-term exposure of atazanavir (ATV). We report the results of the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ATV exposure measured in hair in an observational cohort representative of US women living with HIV; the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Approximately 14.1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed in linear regression-based GWAS, with replication, adjusted for nongenetic predictors collected under conditions of actual use of ATV in 398 participants. Lastly, the PharmGKB database was used to identify pharmacogene associations with ATV exposure. The rs73208473, within intron 1 of SORCS2, resulted in a 0.46-fold decrease in ATV exposure, with the strongest association (P = 1.71×10<sup>-8</sup> ) in GWAS. A priori pharmacogene screening did not identify additional variants statistically significantly associated with ATV exposure, including those previously published in ATV plasma candidate pharmacogene studies. The findings demonstrate the potential value of pharmacogenomic GWAS in ethnically diverse populations under conditions of actual use.",1

29304078,"The ability to orchestrate appropriate physiological and behavioral responses to stress is important for survival, and is often dysfunctional in neuropsychiatric disorders that account for leading causes of global disability burden. Numerous studies have shown that the endocannabinoid neurotransmitter system is able to regulate stress responses and could serve as a therapeutic target for the management of these disorders. We used quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions to show that genes encoding enzymes that synthesize (abhd4, gde1, napepld), enzymes that degrade (faah, faah2a, faah2b), and receptors that bind (cnr1, cnr2, gpr55-like) endocannabinoids are expressed in zebrafish (Danio rerio). These genes are conserved in many other vertebrates, including humans, but fatty acid amide hydrolase 2 has been lost in mice and rats. We engineered transcription activator-like effector nucleases to create zebrafish with mutations in cnr1 and faah2a to test the role of these genes in modulating stress-associated behavior. We showed that disruption of cnr1 potentiated locomotor responses to hyperosmotic stress. The increased response to stress was consistent with rodent literature and served to validate the use of zebrafish in this field. Moreover, we showed for the first time that disruption of faah2a attenuated the locomotor responses to hyperosmotic stress. This later finding suggests that FAAH2 may be an important mediator of stress responses in non-rodent vertebrates. Accordingly, FAAH and FAAH2 modulators could provide distinct therapeutic options for stress-aggravated disorders.",1
29300488,"The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter A subfamily 8 (ABCA8) belongs to the ABCA6-like transporters subgroup, which is distinct from the ABCA1-like subgroup in the ABCA family. The expression and function of the short-size human ABCA8 lacking one of the two ATP-binding domains for ATP hydrolysis, which are regularly present in the other ABCA transporters, have been reported. However, the functional differences between the short-size human ABCA8 and full-size human ABCA8, which has the two ATP-binding domains, remain unknown. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the tissue expression profiles of ABCA6-like and ABCA1-like subgroup transporters and the functional characteristics of ABCA8 in mouse and human. The tissue distribution of mouse ABCA (mABCA) transporter protein and the changes in mABCA8 protein expression levels in a mouse model of obstructive cholestasis were elucidated by means of quantitative targeted absolute proteomics (QTAP). The transport characteristics were clarified in a HEK293 cell line overexpressing full-size ABCA8 protein. QTAP and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that mABCA transporters exhibited the distinct protein expression patterns in the tissues, and mABCA8b, its mouse orthologue, was abundant in the liver and predominantly distributed in sinusoidal membranes of the hepatocytes. Further, protein expression of mABCA8b was decreased in the mouse cholestasis liver. Changes of mABCA8b expression level in cholestasis were similar to those of mABCA1, a sinusoidal cholesterol efflux transporter. Uptake and efflux assays showed that ABCA8 mediates efflux of [<sup>3</sup>H]cholesterol and [<sup>3</sup>H]taurocholate, while it showed no significant efflux activity for [<sup>3</sup>H]estrone sulfate, [<sup>3</sup>H]digoxin, [<sup>3</sup>H]vinblastine, [<sup>3</sup>H]para-aminohippuric acid, [<sup>3</sup>H]oleic acid, [<sup>14</sup>C]nicotine, or [<sup>3</sup>H]methotrexate. [<sup>3</sup>H]Cholesterol efflux was increased by extracellularly applied taurocholate. These results suggest that mABCA8b/ABCA8 functions as a sinusoidal efflux transporter for at least cholesterol and taurocholate in mouse and human liver.",1
29293537,"Gene-level analysis of ImmunoChip or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data has not been previously reported for systemic sclerosis (SSc, scleroderma). The objective of this study was to analyze genetic susceptibility loci in SSc at the gene level and to determine if the detected associations were shared in African-American and White populations, using data from ImmunoChip and GWAS genotyping studies. The White sample included 1833 cases and 3466 controls (956 cases and 2741 controls from the US and 877 cases and 725 controls from Spain) and the African American sample, 291 cases and 260 controls. In both Whites and African Americans, we performed a gene-level analysis that integrates association statistics in a gene possibly harboring multiple SNPs with weak effect on disease risk, using Versatile Gene-based Association Study (VEGAS) software. The SNP-level analysis was performed using PLINK v.1.07. We identified 4 novel candidate genes (STAT1, FCGR2C, NIPSNAP3B, and SCT) significantly associated and 4 genes (SERBP1, PINX1, TMEM175 and EXOC2) suggestively associated with SSc in the gene level analysis in White patients. As an exploratory analysis we compared the results on Whites with those from African Americans. Of previously established susceptibility genes identified in Whites, only TNFAIP3 was significant at the nominal level (p = 6.13x10-3) in African Americans in the gene-level analysis of the ImmunoChip data. Among the top suggestive novel genes identified in Whites based on the ImmunoChip data, FCGR2C and PINX1 were only nominally significant in African Americans (p = 0.016 and p = 0.028, respectively), while among the top novel genes identified in the gene-level analysis in African Americans, UNC5C (p = 5.57x10-4) and CLEC16A (p = 0.0463) were also nominally significant in Whites. We also present the gene-level analysis of SSc clinical and autoantibody phenotypes among Whites. Our findings need to be validated by independent studies, particularly due to the limited sample size of African Americans.",1
29287774,"Peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidases catalyze the first step of beta-oxidation of a variety of substrates broken down in the peroxisome. These include the CoA-esters of very long-chain fatty acids, branched-chain fatty acids and the C27-bile acid intermediates. In rat, three peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidases with different substrate specificities are known, whereas in humans it is believed that only two peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidases are expressed under normal circumstances. Only three patients with ACOX2 deficiency, including two siblings, have been identified so far, showing accumulation of the C27-bile acid intermediates. Here, we performed biochemical studies in material from a novel ACOX2-deficient patient with increased levels of C27-bile acids in plasma, a complete loss of ACOX2 protein expression on immunoblot, but normal pristanic acid oxidation activity in fibroblasts. Since pristanoyl-CoA is presumed to be handled by ACOX2 specifically, these findings prompted us to re-investigate the expression of the human peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidases. We report for the first time expression of ACOX3 in normal human tissues at the mRNA and protein level. Substrate specificity studies were done for ACOX1, 2 and 3 which revealed that ACOX1 is responsible for the oxidation of straight-chain fatty acids with different chain lengths, ACOX2 is the only human acyl-CoA oxidase involved in bile acid biosynthesis, and both ACOX2 and ACOX3 are involved in the degradation of the branched-chain fatty acids. Our studies provide new insights both into ACOX2 deficiency and into the role of the different acyl-CoA oxidases in peroxisomal metabolism.",1
29253717,"Recent reports in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research suggest that alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expression are associated with disease pathology. Our previous studies suggest that A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) expression is important in AD and could be modulated by an extended regulatory region that includes the 3' untranslated region. In this study, we have investigated the role of trans-acting factors in ADAM10 gene regulation. Our study shows that miRNA-140-5p has enhanced expression in the AD postmortem brain hippocampus using high-throughput miRNA arrays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Interestingly, we have also seen that miRNA-140-5p seed sequence is present on 3' untranslated region of both ADAM10 and its transcription factor SOX2. The specific interaction of miRNA-140-5p with both ADAM10 and SOX2 signifies high regulatory importance of this miRNA in controlling ADAM10 expression. Thus, this investigation unravels mechanisms underlying ADAM10 downregulation by miR-140-5p and suggests that dysfunctional regulation of ADAM10 expression is exacerbated by AD-related neurotoxic effects. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the impact of trans-acting factors in the modulation of AD pathophysiology.",1
29253144,"Rubella vaccination induces widely variable immune responses in vaccine recipients. While rubella vaccination is effective at inducing immunity to rubella infection in most subjects, up to 5% of individuals do not achieve or maintain long-term protective immunity. To expand upon our previous work identifying genetic polymorphisms that are associated with these interindividual differences in humoral immunity to rubella virus, we performed a genome-wide association study in a large cohort of 1843 subjects to discover single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with rubella virus-specific cellular immune responses. We identified SNPs in the Wilms tumor protein gene (WT1) that were significantly associated (P < 5 × 10-8) with interindividual variations in rubella-specific interleukin 6 secretion from subjects' peripheral blood mononuclear cells postvaccination. No SNPs were found to be significantly associated with variations in rubella-specific interferon-γ secretion. Our findings demonstrate that genetic polymorphisms in the WT1 gene in subjects of European ancestry are associated with interindividual differences in rubella virus-specific cellular immunity after measles-mumps-rubella II vaccination.",1

29247567,"ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinases) are involved in various biological events such as cell adhesion, migration and invasion, membrane protein shedding and proteolysis. However, there have been no systematic studies on the expression of ADAMs in human ovarian carcinomas. We therefore examined mRNA expression of all the proteolytic ADAM species including ADAM8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 28, 30, 33 and ADAMDEC1 in human ovarian carcinomas, and found that prototype membrane-anchored ADAM9m, but not secreted isoform ADAM9s, is significantly over-expressed in carcinomas than in control non-neoplastic ovarian tissue. Among the histological subtypes of serous, endometrioid, mucinous and clear cell carcinomas, ADAM9m expression was highest in clear cell carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry showed that all the clear cell carcinoma samples displayed ADAM9m primarily on the carcinoma cell membrane. By immunoblotting, ADAM9m was detected mainly in an active form in the clear cell carcinoma tissues. When two clear cell carcinoma cell lines (RMG-I and TOV21G cells) with ADAM9m expression were treated with cisplatin, viability was significantly reduced and apoptosis increased in ADAM9m knockdown cells compared with mock transfectants. In addition, treatment of the cells with neutralizing anti-ADAM9m antibody significantly decreased viability compared with non-immune IgG, whereas ADAM9m over-expression significantly increased viability compared with mock transfectants. Our data show, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time, that ADAM9m is over-expressed in an activated form in human ovarian clear cell carcinomas, and suggest that ADAM9m plays a key role in cisplatin resistance.",1

29220657,"The Polycomb-repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2 play a key role in chromosome silencing induced by the non-coding RNA Xist. Polycomb recruitment is initiated by the PCGF3/5-PRC1 complex, which catalyzes chromosome-wide H2A lysine 119 ubiquitylation, signaling recruitment of other PRC1 complexes, and PRC2. However, the molecular mechanism for PCGF3/5-PRC1 recruitment by Xist RNA is not understood. Here we define the Xist RNA Polycomb Interaction Domain (XR-PID), a 600 nt sequence encompassing the Xist B-repeat element. Deletion of XR-PID abolishes Xist-dependent Polycomb recruitment, in turn abrogating Xist-mediated gene silencing and reversing Xist-induced chromatin inaccessibility. We identify the RNA-binding protein hnRNPK as the principal XR-PID binding factor required to recruit PCGF3/5-PRC1. Accordingly, synthetically tethering hnRNPK to Xist RNA lacking XR-PID is sufficient for Xist-dependent Polycomb recruitment. Our findings define a key pathway for Polycomb recruitment by Xist RNA, providing important insights into mechanisms of chromatin modification by non-coding RNA.",1

The degradation rate of diazo dye Reactive Green 19 and the electricity generation was enhanced in photocatalytic fuel cell with higher dissolved oxygen concentration. However, the photocatalytic fuel cell was still able to perform 37% of decolorization in a slow rate (k = 0.033 h<sup>-1</sup>) under extremely low dissolved oxygen concentration (approximately 0.2 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) when nitrogen gas was introduced into the fuel cell throughout the 8 h.

29198326,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) can adversely affect completion of systemic anti-cancer treatment and cause long-term morbidity. Increasingly pharmacogenetic studies have been performed to explore susceptibility to this important adverse effect. A systematic review was conducted to identify pharmacogenetic studies, assess their quality and findings and undertake meta-analysis where possible. 93 studies were included. Notable methodological issues included lack of standardisation and detail in phenotype definition and acknowledgement of potential confounding factors. Insufficient data was presented in many studies meaning only a minority could be included in meta-analysis showing mainly non-significant effects. Nonetheless, SNPs in CYP2C8, CYP3A4, ARHGEF10, EPHA and TUBB2A genes (taxanes), FARS2, ACYP2 and TAC1 (oxaliplatin), and CEP75 and CYP3A5 (vincristine) are of potential interest.

29192561,"Over the last decade, there has been increasing interest in the use of probiotic microorganisms. However, certain doubts have arisen around probiotics, because of the beneficial effects of these microorganisms are not clear yet, and in many occasions those beneficial effects have not been proven. Therefore, it would be of interest if these probiotic strains were able to acquire new attributes to allow them improve and increase their beneficial characteristics. Genetic engineering can be used for human applications; for instance, the resistance to antibiotics is removed and the probiotic bacteria are modified in its own DNA. This process can be achieved by: (1) the use of food-grade vectors derived from lactic acid bacteria and/or bifidobacteria cryptic plasmids, (2) the genes integration or deletion in the chromosome of the probiotic strain, by site-specific recombination using the attP/integrase system, or by homologous recombination, using either suicide vectors, (3) using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and the CRISPR-associated (Cas) nuclease.

29160844,"Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an unstable cytosine adenine guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeat expansion encoding a polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. Previously, we identified several up- and down-regulated protein molecules in the striatum of the Hdh<sup>(CAG)150</sup> knock-in mice at 16 months of age, a mouse model which is modeling the early human HD stage. Among those molecules, aconitase 2 (Aco2) located in the mitochondrial matrix is involved in the energy generation and susceptible to increased oxidative stress that would lead to inactivation of Aco2 activity. In this study, we demonstrate decreased Aco2 protein level and activity in the brain of both Hdh<sup>(CAG)150</sup> and R6/2 mice. Aco2 activity was decreased in striatum of Hdh<sup>(CAG)150</sup> mice at 16 months of age as well as R6/2 mice at 7 to 13 weeks of age. Aco2 activity in the striatum of R6/2 mice could be restored by the anti-oxidant, <i>N</i>-acetyl-l-cysteine, supporting that decreased Aco2 activity in HD is probably caused by increased oxidative damage. Decreased Aco2 activity was further found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of both HD patients and pre-symptomatic HD mutation (PreHD) carriers, while the decreased Aco2 protein level of PBMC was only present in HD patients. Aco2 activity correlated significantly with motor score, independence scale, and functional capacity of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale as well as disease duration.

Herein, we applied a hospital-based case-control study covering two independent cohorts and a subsequent functional assay to determine the roles of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the BER pathway genes in cervical cancer. Results indicated that the <i>XRCC1</i> rs3213245 (-77TC) TT genotype was associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer. The immunohistochemistry assay showed that XRCC1 protein expression levels were upregulated in cervical cancer patients with the <i>XRCC1</i> rs3213245 CC genotype compared with the CT or TT genotypes. Further, results from ChIP assay showed that Sp1 could bind to the -77 site and that the rs3213245 C genotype promoted the binding of Sp1 to the <i>XRCC1</i> promoter. Moreover, ChIP/Re-ChIP assays revealed that transcription factor Krox-20 was recruited to the XRCC1 rs3213245 mutation region and regulated the transcription of the <i>XRCC1</i> gene by interacting with Sp1, ultimately mediated cervical cancer development.

29156001,"Candida albicans is the primary fungal pathogen of humans. Despite the need for novel drugs to combat fungal infections [Sobel, J.D. (2000) Clin Infectious Dis 30: 652], antifungal drug discovery is currently limited by both the availability of suitable drug targets and assays to screen corresponding targets. A functional genomics approach based on the diploid C. albicans genome sequence, termed GRACETM (gene replacement and conditional expression), was used to assess gene essentiality through a combination of gene replacement and conditional gene expression. In a systematic application of this approach, we identify 567 essential genes in C. albicans. Interestingly, evaluating the conditional phenotype of all identifiable C. albicans homologues of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae essential gene set [Giaever, G., Chu, A.M., Ni, L., Connelly, C., Riles, L., Veronneau, S., et al. (2002) Nature 418: 387-391] by GRACE revealed only 61% to be essential in C. albicans, emphasizing the importance of performing such studies directly within the pathogen. Construction of this conditional mutant strain collection facilitates large-scale examination of terminal phenotypes of essential genes. This information enables preferred drug targets to be selected from the C. albicans essential gene set by phenotypic information derived both in vitro, such as cidal versus static terminal phenotypes, as well as in vivo through virulence studies using conditional strains in an animal model of infection. In addition, the combination of phenotypic and bioinformatic analyses further improves drug target selection from the C. albicans essential gene set, and their respective conditional mutant strains may be directly used as sensitive whole-cell assays for drug screening.",1
29153515,"There are many factors that influence the day-ahead market bidding strategies of a generation company (GenCo) within the framework of the current energy market. Environmental policy issues are giving rise to emission limitation that are becoming more and more important for fossil-fueled power plants, and these must be considered in their management. This work investigates the influence of the emissions reduction plan and the incorporation of the medium-term derivative commitments in the optimal generation bidding strategy for the day-ahead electricity market. Two different technologies have been considered: the high-emission technology of thermal coal units and the low-emission technology of combined cycle gas turbine units. The Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL) and the Spanish National Emissions Reduction Plan (NERP) defines the environmental framework for dealing with the day-ahead market bidding strategies. To address emission limitations, we have extended some of the standard risk management methodologies developed for financial markets, such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), thus leading to the new concept of Conditional Emission at Risk (CEaR). This study offers electricity generation utilities a mathematical model for determining the unit's optimal generation bid to the wholesale electricity market such that it maximizes the long-term profits of the utility while allowing it to abide by the Iberian Electricity Market rules as well as the environmental restrictions set by the Spanish National Emissions Reduction Plan. We analyze the economic implications for a GenCo that includes the environmental restrictions of this National Plan as well as the NERP's effects on the expected profits and the optimal generation bid.",0

Recent studies have shown that ADAMTS4 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 4) is a pathogenic factor of plaque vulnerability in mice. However, the relationship between ADAMTS4 and carotid atherosclerotic vulnerable plaques in humans remains unclear.",1
29153407,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases; thus, understanding its metabolic circuitry is clinically important. Many studies of BAT compare rodents mildly cold to those severely cold. Here, we compared BAT remodeling between thermoneutral and mild-cold-adapted mice, conditions more relevant to humans. Although BAT is renowned for catabolic β-oxidative capacity, we find paradoxically that the anabolic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) genes encoding ACLY, ACSS2, ACC, and FASN were among the most upregulated by mild cold and that, in humans, DNL correlates with Ucp1 expression. The regulation and function of adipocyte DNL and its association with thermogenesis are not understood. We provide evidence suggesting that AKT2 drives DNL in adipocytes by stimulating ChREBPβ transcriptional activity and that cold induces the AKT2-ChREBP pathway in BAT to optimize fuel storage and thermogenesis. These data provide insight into adipocyte DNL regulation and function and illustrate the metabolic flexibility of thermogenesis.",1
29147026,"Discovering genetic variants associated with human brain structures is an on-going effort. The ENIGMA consortium conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with standard multi-study analytical methodology and identified several significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Here we employ a novel analytical approach that incorporates functional genome annotations (e.g., exon or 5'UTR), total linkage disequilibrium (LD) scores and heterozygosity to construct enrichment scores for improved identification of relevant SNPs. The method provides increased power to detect associated SNPs by estimating stratum-specific false discovery rate (FDR), where strata are classified according to enrichment scores. Applying this approach to the GWAS summary statistics of putamen volume in the ENIGMA cohort, a total of 15 independent significant SNPs were identified (conditional FDR < 0.05). In contrast, 4 SNPs were found based on standard GWAS analysis (P < 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). These 11 novel loci include GATAD2B, ASCC3, DSCAML1, and HELZ, which are previously implicated in various neural related phenotypes. The current findings demonstrate the boost in power with the annotation-informed FDR method, and provide insight into the genetic architecture of the putamen.",1
29146910,"The overall survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is poor and identification of new disease-related therapeutic targets remains a major goal for this disease. Here we show that expression of MPP1, a PDZ-domain-containing protein, highly correlated with ABCC4 in AML, is associated with worse overall survival in AML. Murine hematopoietic progenitor cells overexpressing MPP1 acquired the ability to serially replate in methylcellulose culture, a property crucially dependent upon ABCC4. The highly conserved PDZ-binding motif of ABCC4 is required for ABCC4 and MPP1 to form a protein complex, which increased ABCC4 membrane localization and retention, to enhance drug resistance. Specific disruption of this protein complex, either genetically or chemically, removed ABCC4 from the plasma membrane, increased drug sensitivity, and abrogated MPP1-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell replating in methylcellulose. High-throughput screening identified Antimycin A as a small molecule that disrupted the ABCC4-MPP1 protein complex and reversed drug resistance in AML cell lines and in primary patient AML cells. In all, targeting the ABCC4-MPP1 protein complex can lead to new therapies to improve treatment outcome of AML, a disease where the long-term prognosis is poor.",1
29143120,"A disintegrin and metalloprotease with motif 5(ADAMTS5) has been involved in colorectal cancer (CRC) with hypermethylation in the promoter. However, its role in CRC remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the clinical significance and biological effect of ADAMTS5 on colorectal carcinogenesis. Through MSP, qRT-PCR, WB and IHC analysis, followed by a variety of in vitro assays, we report the function of ADAMTS5 in CRC. ADAMTS5 was markedly hypermethylaed and downregulated in tumor tissues compared with non-tumor tissues (p < 0.001). Negative expression of ADAMTS5 was much more common in tumor tissues than that in normal tissues (p < 0.001) and correlated with histologic types (p = 0.002), poor OS (p = 0.029) and DFS (p = 0.018). In vitro assay revealed that overexpression of ADAMTS5 inhibited the capabilities of migration and invasion of CRC cells, and no effect on cell growth, cell cycle and apoptosis. ADAMTS5 is hypermethylated and inhibits cancer cells invasion and migration in colorectal cancer, and correlates with OS and DFS, indicating that ADAMTS5 might be a useful biomarker in colorectal cancer therapy.",1
29138461,"Cell motility plays an important role in intrahepatic metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and predicts poor prognosis in patients. The present study investigated the role of a disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) in HCC, since these proteins are known to be associated with cell motility. We confirmed the expression of 12 ADAMs with putative metalloproteinase activity in HCC cells, and established a KYN-2 HCC cell line stably expressing short interfering RNA against ADAM21 to investigate the effect of ADAM21 deficiency on HCC cell motility and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. We also examined ADAM21 expression in a cohort of 119 HCC patients by immunohistochemistry. ADAM21 was overexpressed in KYN-2 cells, and its knockdown reduced invasion, migration, proliferation, and metastasis relative to controls. In clinical specimens, ADAM21 positivity was associated with vascular invasion, large tumor size, high histological grade, and lower overall and recurrence-free survival as compared to cases that were negative for ADAM21 expression. A multivariate analysis revealed that ADAM21 positivity was an independent risk factor for overall (P = 0.003) and recurrence-free (P = 0.001) survival. These results suggest that ADAM21 plays a role in HCC metastasis and can serve as a prognostic marker for disease progression.",1

29122566,"The genetic status of candidate tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) at chromosome 3p has not yet been elucidated in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). Herein, we retrospectively investigated 32 fresh iCCA case samples from a single medical institution to clarify mutations of 11 TSGs by next-generation sequencing. Validation of the mutations was performed on the MassARRAY platform or by high-resolution melting curve analysis. We then integrated the gene mutations into copy number alterations at chromosome 3p that had been generated in a previous study using the same fresh iCCA samples, and correlated the integration results with the clinicopathologic features. Nine of the 32 (28.1%) iCCA patients had gene mutations at chromosome 3p, totaling 11 mutations across five genes. Those included five (15.6%) BAP1 mutations, two each (6.3%) of CACNA2D3 and RASSF1 mutations, and one each (3.1%) of ATG7 and PLCD1 mutations. Six (18.8%) cases had concurrent loss of chromosome 3p and gene mutations. Patients with TSG mutations had shorter disease-free and survival times than those without the mutations. Our data showed that iCCA patients with TSG mutations at chromosome 3p faced an adverse prognosis. BAP1 was the common target of mutational inactivation and may be a principal driver of 3p21 losses.",1
29118573,"The objective of this study was to identify the major electricity and water-consuming components of a pasture-based automatic milking (AM) system and to establish the daily and seasonal consumption trends. Electricity and water meters were installed on 7 seasonal calving pasture-based AM farms across Ireland. Electricity-consuming processes and equipment that were metered for consumption included milk cooling components, air compressors, AM unit(s), auxiliary water heaters, water pumps, lights, sockets, automatic manure scrapers, and so on. On-farm direct water-consuming processes and equipment were metered and included AM unit(s), auxiliary water heaters, tubular coolers, wash-down water pumps, livestock drinking water supply, and miscellaneous water taps. Data were collected and analyzed for the 12-mo period of 2015. The average AM farm examined had 114 cows, milking with 1.85 robots, performing a total of 105 milkings/AM unit per day. Total electricity consumption and costs were 62.6 Wh/L of milk produced and 0.91 cents/L, respectively. Milking (vacuum and milk pumping, within-AM unit water heating) had the largest electrical consumption at 33%, followed by air compressing (26%), milk cooling (18%), auxiliary water heating (8%), water pumping (4%), and other electricity-consuming processes (11%). Electricity costs followed a similar trend to that of consumption, with the milking process and water pumping accounting for the highest and lowest cost, respectively. The pattern of daily electricity consumption was similar across the lactation periods, with peak consumption occurring at 0100, 0800, and between 1300 and 1600 h. The trends in seasonal electricity consumption followed the seasonal milk production curve. Total water consumption was 3.7 L of water/L of milk produced. Water consumption associated with the dairy herd at the milking shed represented 42% of total water consumed on the farm. Daily water consumption trends indicated consumption to be lowest in the early morning period (0300-0600 h), followed by spikes in consumption between 1100 and 1400 h. Seasonal water trends followed the seasonal milk production curve, except for the month of May, when water consumption was reduced due to above-average rainfall. This study provides a useful insight into the consumption of electricity and water on a pasture-based AM farms, while also facilitating the development of future strategies and technologies likely to increase the sustainability of AM systems.",0

29103054,"Several large genome wide association studies have identified a locus in close proximity to the gene encoding the enzyme aminocarboxymuconate-semialdehyde-decarboxylase (ACMSD) to be associated with the risk for Parkinson's disease (PD), tentatively suggesting that this enzyme might influence PD pathogenesis. Further support for this comes from the recent identification of a disease-segregating stop codon mutation in ACMSD in a family with Parkinsonism, and a missense mutation in the ACMSD gene predicted to disrupt enzyme function in an individual with typical PD. ACMSD is part of the kynurenine pathway, responsible for the catalytic breakdown of tryptophan into NAD+, generating several neuroactive metabolites in the process. The enzyme is located at a key branch-point of the pathway, limiting the production of the neurotoxin quinolinic acid, which has excitotoxic and inflammatory properties. In this review, we discuss the genetic findings in light of the functions of ACMSD and its potential involvement in PD pathogenesis.",1
29100804,"mRNA turnover controls gene expression under various conditions in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases and intranuclear inclusion body disease (INIBD) are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the formation of nuclear inclusions. These inclusions are immunopositive for several proteins associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the processing of RNA from gene transcription through degradation (RNA metabolism) has been reported to be altered. We hypothesized that the proteins associated with RNA metabolism are also involved in the formation of nuclear inclusions in polyQ diseases and INIBD. 3'-5' exoribonuclease DIS3L2 and 5'-3' exoribonuclease XRN1 play critical roles in mRNA decay. Using immunohistochemistry with antibodies against DIS3L2 and XRN1, we examined the brains of patients with polyQ diseases and INIBD and normal control subjects. In controls, immunoreactivity for DIS3L2 and XRN1 was found in the neuronal cytoplasm and neuropil, respectively. In INIBD, immunoreactivity for DIS3L2 and XRN1 was present in neuronal and glial nuclear inclusions. Co-localization of ubiquitin and DIS3L2 or XRN1 was demonstrated in these inclusions. In polyQ diseases, however, nuclear inclusions were immunonegative for DIS3L2 and XRN1. These findings suggest that sequestration of exoribonucleases to nuclear inclusions may be related to the pathogenesis of INIBD.",1
29094401,"The Medicines Use Review is a community pharmacy service funded in the United Kingdom to improve patients' adherence to medication and reduce medicines waste. The objective was to develop, pilot, and utilize a new Medicines Use Review patient satisfaction questionnaire. A questionnaire for patient self-completion was developed using a published framework of patient satisfaction with the Medicines Use Review service. The questions were validated using the content validity index and the questionnaire piloted through three pharmacies (February-April 2016). The revised questionnaire contained 12 questions with responses on a 5-point Likert scale, and a comments box. The questionnaire was distributed to patients following a Medicines Use Review consultation via community pharmacies (June-October 2016). Exploratory factor analysis and Cronbach's α were performed to investigate the relationships between the items and to examine structural validity. The survey results were examined for patients' reported satisfaction with Medicines Use Reviews, while the handwritten comments were thematically analyzed and mapped against the questionnaire items. An estimated 2,151 questionnaires were handed out, and a total of 505 responses were received indicating a 24% response rate. Exploratory factor analysis revealed two factors with a cumulative variance of 68.8%, and Cronbach's α showed high internal consistency for each factor (α=0.90 and α=0.89, respectively). The survey results demonstrated that patients could show a high degree of overall satisfaction with the service, even if initially reluctant to take part in a Medicines Use Review. The results support the Medicines Use Review patient satisfaction questionnaire as a suitable tool for measuring patient satisfaction with the Medicines Use Review service. A wider study is needed to confirm the findings about this community pharmacy-based adherence service.",0
29092687,"A significant growth of research in nanofluidics is achieved over the past decade, but the field is still facing considerable challenges toward the transition from the current physics-centered stage to the next application-oriented stage. Many of these challenges are associated with materials science, so the field of nanofluidics offers great opportunities for materials scientists to exploit. In addition, the use of unusual effects and ultrasmall confined spaces of well-defined nanofluidic environments would offer new mechanisms and technologies to manipulate nanoscale objects as well as to synthesize novel nanomaterials in the liquid phase. Therefore, nanofluidics will be a new arena for materials science. In the past few years, burgeoning progress has been made toward this trend, as overviewed in this article, including materials and methods for fabricating nanofluidic devices, nanofluidics with functionalized surfaces and functional material components, as well as nanofluidics for manipulating nanoscale materials and fabricating new nanomaterials. Many critical challenges as well as fantastic opportunities in this arena lie ahead. Some of those, which are of particular interest, are also discussed.",0
29087237,"Objectives Expression profile of GSE57691 was analyzed to identify the similarities and differences between aortic occlusive disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm. Methods The expression profile of GSE57691 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database, including 20 small abdominal aortic aneurysm samples, 29 large abdominal aortic aneurysm samples, 9 aortic occlusive disease samples, and 10 control samples. Using the limma package in R, the differentially expressed genes were screened. Followed by enrichment analysis was performed for the differentially expressed genes using database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery online tool. Based on string online tool and Cytoscape software, protein-protein interaction network and module analyses were carried out. Moreover, integrated TF platform database and Cytoscape software were used for constructing transcriptional regulatory networks. Results As a result, 1757, 354, and 396 differentially expressed genes separately were identified in aortic occlusive disease, large abdominal aortic aneurysm, and small abdominal aortic aneurysm samples. UBB was significantly enriched in proteolysis related pathways with a high degree in three groups. SPARCL1 was another gene shared by these groups and regulated by NFIA, which had a high degree in transcriptional regulatory network. ACTB, a significant upregulated gene in abdominal aortic aneurysm samples, could be regulated by CLIC4, which was significantly enriched in cell motions. ACLY and NFIB were separately identified in aortic occlusive disease and small abdominal aortic aneurysm samples, and separately enriched in lipid metabolism and negative regulation of cell proliferation. Conclusions The downregulated UBB, NFIA, and SPARCL1 might play key roles in both aortic occlusive disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm, while the upregulated ACTB might only involve in abdominal aortic aneurysm. ACLY and NFIB were specifically involved in aortic occlusive disease and small abdominal aortic aneurysm separately.",1
29083697,"Household electricity wastage poses a sustainability issue. Ergonomic interventions that prevent wastage through technological innovations are expensive and complex, making consumers unwilling to adopt them. The study aimed to investigate the motivations and impediments in avoiding electricity wastage. Thirteen Repertory Grid interviews were conducted on household electricity users relating to the behaviour of those living with them. The key motivational themes found were altruistic and egoistic reasons while the impediments were perceived behavioural control, hedonism and self-efficacy. Based on the research findings, a behavioural modification framework was developed to encourage consumers to adopt a higher level of responsible electricity practice through the following suggested interventions - (1) reframing sustainability from 'future-for-others' to 'present-for-us', (2) clarifying responsible consumption and (3) performance feedback. The research identified the key motivations and impediments of being a responsible household electricity user and provided a framework to encourage a higher responsibility level. Practitioner Summary: Household electricity wastage poses sustainability issue: excess CO<sub>2</sub> & high costs. We developed a mindset changing behavioural modification framework. We investigated HFE issues: motivations & impediments of avoiding the wastage, i.e. altruistic, egoistic, behavioural control, hedonism & self-efficacy. The framework provides governments insights into strategies to address the wastage.",0
29080034,"Although the widespread use of the term ""Big Data"" is comparatively recent, it invokes a phenomenon in the developments of database technology with distinct historical contexts. The database engineer Jim Gray, known as ""Mr. Database"" in Silicon Valley before his disappearance at sea in 2007, was involved in many of the crucial developments since the 1970s that constitute the foundation of exceedingly large and distributed databases. Jim Gray was involved in the development of relational database systems based on the concepts of Edgar F. Codd at IBM in the 1970s before he went on to develop principles of Transaction Processing that enable the parallel and highly distributed performance of databases today. He was also involved in creating forums for discourse between academia and industry, which influenced industry performance standards as well as database research agendas. As a co-founder of the San Francisco branch of Microsoft Research, Gray increasingly turned toward scientific applications of database technologies, e. g. leading the TerraServer project, an online database of satellite images. Inspired by Vannevar Bush's idea of the memex, Gray laid out his vision of a Personal Memex as well as a World Memex, eventually postulating a new era of data-based scientific discovery termed ""Fourth Paradigm Science"". This article gives an overview of Gray's contributions to the development of database technology as well as his research agendas and shows that central notions of Big Data have been occupying database engineers for much longer than the actual term has been in use.",0
29078390,"The family of WD40-repeat (WDR) proteins is one of the largest in eukaryotes, but little is known about their function in brain development. Among 26 WDR genes assessed, we found 7 displaying a major impact in neuronal morphology when inactivated in mice. Remarkably, all seven genes showed corpus callosum defects, including thicker (<i>Atg16l1</i>, <i>Coro1c</i>, <i>Dmxl2</i>, and <i>Herc1</i>), thinner (<i>Kif21b</i> and <i>Wdr89</i>), or absent corpus callosum (<i>Wdr47</i>), revealing a common role for WDR genes in brain connectivity. We focused on the poorly studied WDR47 protein sharing structural homology with LIS1, which causes lissencephaly. In a dosage-dependent manner, mice lacking <i>Wdr47</i> showed lethality, extensive fiber defects, microcephaly, thinner cortices, and sensory motor gating abnormalities. We showed that WDR47 shares functional characteristics with LIS1 and participates in key microtubule-mediated processes, including neural stem cell proliferation, radial migration, and growth cone dynamics. In absence of WDR47, the exhaustion of late cortical progenitors and the consequent decrease of neurogenesis together with the impaired survival of late-born neurons are likely yielding to the worsening of the microcephaly phenotype postnatally. Interestingly, the WDR47-specific C-terminal to LisH (CTLH) domain was associated with functions in autophagy described in mammals. Silencing WDR47 in hypothalamic GT1-7 neuronal cells and yeast models independently recapitulated these findings, showing conserved mechanisms. Finally, our data identified superior cervical ganglion-10 (SCG10) as an interacting partner of WDR47. Taken together, these results provide a starting point for studying the implications of WDR proteins in neuronal regulation of microtubules and autophagy.",1
29074580,"Viruses regulate host metabolic networks to improve their survival. The molecules that are responsive to viral infection and regulate such metabolic changes are hardly known, but are essential for understanding viral infection. Here we identify a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that is induced by multiple viruses, but not by type I interferon (IFN-I), and facilitates viral replication in mouse and human cells. In vivo deficiency of lncRNA-ACOD1 (a lncRNA identified by its nearest coding gene <i>Acod1</i>, aconitate decarboxylase 1) significantly attenuates viral infection through IFN-I-IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3)-independent pathways. Cytoplasmic lncRNA-ACOD1 directly binds the metabolic enzyme glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT2) near the substrate niche, enhancing its catalytic activity. Recombinant GOT2 protein and its metabolites could rescue viral replication upon lncRNA-ACOD1 deficiency and increase lethality. This work reveals a feedback mechanism of virus-induced lncRNA-mediated metabolic promotion of viral infection and a potential target for developing broad-acting antiviral therapeutics.",0
29069459,"Gene overlap plays various regulatory functions on transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Most current studies focus on protein-coding genes overlapping with non-protein-coding counterparts, the so called natural antisense transcripts. Considerably less is known about the role of gene overlap in the case of two protein-coding genes. Here, we provide OverGeneDB, a database of human and mouse 5' end protein-coding overlapping genes. The database contains 582 human and 113 mouse gene pairs that are transcribed using overlapping promoters in at least one analyzed library. Gene pairs were identified based on the analysis of the transcription start site (TSS) coordinates in 73 human and 10 mouse organs, tissues and cell lines. Beside TSS data, resources for 26 human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines also contain RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data for seven histone modifications and RNA Polymerase II activity. The collected data revealed that the overlap region is rarely conserved between the studied species and tissues. In ∼50% of the overlapping genes, transcription started explicitly in the overlap regions. In the remaining half of overlapping genes, transcription was initiated both from overlapping and non-overlapping TSSs. OverGeneDB is accessible at http://overgenedb.amu.edu.pl.",0

This study surveyed 94 nutrition teachers and 46 dietitians working at elementary, middle, and high schools in Jeju during 7-14 May 2015. The importance and performance of 16 tasks of nutrition teachers and dietitians were measured using questionnaires. The data was analyzed by using the SPSS software and Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA). Importance was ranked in the order of foodservice operation (4.72), dietary life education (4.37), and nutrition counseling (4.24); and performance was ranked in the order of foodservice operation (4.48), dietary life education (3.70), and nutrition counseling (3.22). The importance-performance matrix showed that in Quadrant 4, the ""Concentrate Here"" item was ""nutrition and dietary life education for students"", while in Quadrant 2, the ""Possible Overkill"" item was ""cost control and office management"". These findings suggest that it is important to reduce unnecessary administrative and office management tasks in order for nutrition teachers and dietitians to implement effective nutrition education, dietary life education, and nutrition counseling programs.",0
29058717,"Maladaptive wound healing responses to chronic tissue injury result in organ fibrosis. Fibrosis, which entails excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and tissue remodeling by activated myofibroblasts, leads to loss of proper tissue architecture and organ function; however, the molecular mediators of myofibroblast activation have yet to be fully identified. Here we identify soluble ephrin-B2 (sEphrin-B2) as a new profibrotic mediator in lung and skin fibrosis. We provide molecular, functional and translational evidence that the ectodomain of membrane-bound ephrin-B2 is shed from fibroblasts into the alveolar airspace after lung injury. Shedding of sEphrin-B2 promotes fibroblast chemotaxis and activation via EphB3 and/or EphB4 receptor signaling. We found that mice lacking ephrin-B2 in fibroblasts are protected from skin and lung fibrosis and that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) is the major ephrin-B2 sheddase in fibroblasts. ADAM10 expression is increased by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and ADAM10-mediated sEphrin-B2 generation is required for TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast activation. Pharmacological inhibition of ADAM10 reduces sEphrin-B2 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage and prevents lung fibrosis in mice. Consistent with the mouse data, ADAM10-sEphrin-B2 signaling is upregulated in fibroblasts from human subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. These results uncover a new molecular mechanism of tissue fibrogenesis and identify sEphrin-B2, its receptors EphB3 and EphB4 and ADAM10 as potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of fibrotic diseases.",1
29056164,"The triad composed by α-Klotho, fibroblast growth factor-23, and its receptor are involved in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) is a metalloproteinase causing the proteolytic shedding of α-Klotho from the cell membrane, and its role in chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder is not yet known. We studied the circulating levels of the above-mentioned mediators in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism due to uremia, compared to control subjects, as well as in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. We also measured the immunofluorescence pattern of the relevant tissue proteins in specimens obtained from patients undergoing parathyroid surgery for secondary compared to primary hyperparathyroidism. Results showed that α-Klotho tissue levels are reduced, in the presence of increased ADAM17 tissue levels. In addition, we showed increased serum levels of the main product of ADAM17 proteolytic activity, tumor necrosis factor-α. Thus, we found a paradoxical situation, in secondary compared to primary hyperparathyroidism, that is, that in the face of increased tumor necrosis factor-α in circulation, both soluble and tissue α-Klotho are reduced significantly, despite increased tissue ADAM17. In conclusion, tissue and serum levels of α-Klotho seem to have become independent from the regulation induced by ADAM17, which constitutes therefore another tassel in the impaired α-Klotho-FGF23 receptor axis present in uremia.",1
29053187,"LncRNAs and microRNAs can play significant roles in various cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). In our study, we investigated the role of lncRNA XIST in GC. We observed that XIST was increased in MGC803 and BGC823 cells compared to human normal gastric epithelial GES-1 cells. It was also shown that miR-185 was decreased in GC cell lines. Silencing XIST can inhibit the growth of GC cells and bioinformatics analysis was performed to confirm the correlation between XIST and miR-185. Interestingly, a negative correlation was indicated between XIST and miR-185 in GC cells. In addition, TGF-β1 was predicted as a target gene of miR-185. miR-185 can modulate TGF-β1 expression negatively in vitro. Moreover, we found that sh-XIST inhibited GC development via decreasing TGF-β1 by upregulating miR-185 in vitro. Therefore, we speculated that XIST can act as a competing endogenous lncRNA (ceRNA) to regulate TGF-β1 by sponging miR-185 in GC. Taken these together, it was indicated that XIST/miR-185/TGF-β1 axis participated in the development of GC. XIST could act as a potential prognostic biomarker in GC development.",1
29051540,"Genetic factors and mechanisms underlying food allergy are largely unknown. Due to heterogeneity of symptoms a reliable diagnosis is often difficult to make. Here, we report a genome-wide association study on food allergy diagnosed by oral food challenge in 497 cases and 2387 controls. We identify five loci at genome-wide significance, the clade B serpin (SERPINB) gene cluster at 18q21.3, the cytokine gene cluster at 5q31.1, the filaggrin gene, the C11orf30/LRRC32 locus, and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. Stratifying the results for the causative food demonstrates that association of the HLA locus is peanut allergy-specific whereas the other four loci increase the risk for any food allergy. Variants in the SERPINB gene cluster are associated with SERPINB10 expression in leukocytes. Moreover, SERPINB genes are highly expressed in the esophagus. All identified loci are involved in immunological regulation or epithelial barrier function, emphasizing the role of both mechanisms in food allergy.",1
29050494,"We performed whole transcriptome analysis of osteosarcoma bone samples. Initially, we sequenced total RNA from 36 fresh-frozen samples (18 tumoral bone samples and 18 non-tumoral paired samples) matching in pairs for each osteosarcoma patient. We also performed independent gene expression analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples to verify the RNAseq results. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples allowed us to analyze the effect of chemotherapy. Data were analyzed with DESeq2, edgeR and Reactome packages of R. We found 5365 genes expressed differentially between the normal bone and osteosarcoma tissues with an FDR below 0.05, of which 3399 genes were upregulated and 1966 were downregulated. Among those genes, BTNL9, MMP14, ABCA10, ACACB, COL11A1, and PKM2 were expressed differentially with the highest significance between tumor and normal bone. Functional annotation with the reactome identified significant changes in the pathways related to the extracellular matrix degradation and collagen biosynthesis. It was suggested that chemotherapy may induce the modification of ECM with important collagen biosynthesis. Taken together, our results indicate that changes in the degradation of extracellular matrix seem to be an important mechanism of osteosarcoma and efficient chemotherapy induces the genes related to bone formation. Impact statement Osteosarcoma is a rare disease but it is of interest to many scientists all over the world because the current standard treatment still has poor results. We sequenced total RNA from 36 fresh-frozen paired samples (18 tumoral bone samples and 18 non-tumoral paired samples) from osteosarcoma patients. We found that differences in the gene expressions between the normal and affected bones reflected the changes in the regulation of the degradation of collagen and extracellular matrix. We believe that these findings contribute to the understanding of OS and suggest ideas for further studies.",1
29036829,"ADAM10 is the α-secretase that cleaves amyloid-β protein precursor in the non-amyloidogenic pathway in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is known to be regulated by different microRNAs (miRNAs), which are post-transcriptional regulators related to several biological and pathological processes, including AD. Here we proposed to explore and validate miRNAs that have direct or indirect relations to the AD pathophysiology and ADAM10 gene. Approximately 700 miRNAs were analyzed and 21 differentially expressed miRNAs were validated in a sample of 21 AD subjects and 17 cognitively healthy matched controls. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with miR-144-5p, miR-221, and miR-374 mimics and inhibitors, and ADAM10 protein levels were evaluated. miR-144-5p, miR-221, and miR-374 were downregulated in AD. The overexpression of miR-221 in SH-SY5Y cells resulted in ADAM10 reduction and its inhibition in ADAM10 increased. These findings show that miR-221 can be a new potential therapeutic target for increasing ADAM10 levels in AD. In addition, these results can contribute to the better understanding of ADAM10 post-transcriptional regulation.",1
29033534,"Uveal melanoma (UM) has a high propensity for metastatic spread, and approximately 40-50% of patients die of metastatic disease. Metastases can be found at the time of diagnosis but also several years after the tumor has been removed. The survival of disseminated cancer cells is known to be linked to anchorage independence, anoikis resistance, and an adaptive cellular metabolism. The cultivation of cancer cells as multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) by anchorage-independent growth enriches for a more aggressive phenotype. The present study examines the differential gene expression of adherent cell cultures, non-adherent MCTS cultures, and uncultured tumor biopsies from three patients with UM. We elucidate the biochemical differences between the culture conditions to find whether the culture of UM as non-adherent MCTS could be linked to an anchorage-independent and more aggressive phenotype, thus unravelling potential targets for treatment of UM dissemination.",1
29031853,"Uveal melanoma is an aggressive cancer which has a high percentage recurrence and with a worse prognosis. Identify the potential prognostic markers of uveal melanoma may provide information for early detection of recurrence and treatment. RNA sequence data of uveal melanoma and patient clinic traits were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Co-expression modules were built by weighted gene co -expression network analysis (WGCNA) and applied to investigate the relationship underlying modules and clinic traits. Besides, functional enrichment analysis was performed on these co-expression genes from interested modules. First, using WGCNA, identified 21 co-expression modules were constructed by the 10975 genes from the 80 human uveal melanoma samples. The number of genes in these modules ranged from 42 to 5091. Found four co -expression modules significantly correlated with three clinic traits (status, recurrence and recurrence Time). Module red, and purple positively correlated with patient's life status and recurrence Time. Module green positively correlates with recurrence. The result of functional enrichment analysis showed that the module magenta was mainly enriched genetic material assemble processes, the purple module was mainly enriched in tissue homeostasis and melanosome membrane and the module red was mainly enriched metastasis of cell, suggesting its critical role in the recurrence and development of the disease. Additionally, identified the hug gene (top connectivity with other genes) in each module. The hub gene SLC17A7, NTRK2, ABTB1 and ADPRHL1 might play a vital role in recurrence of uveal melanoma. Our findings provided the framework of co-expression gene modules of uveal melanoma and identified some prognostic markers might be detection of recurrence and treatment for uveal melanoma.",1
29024700,"Y-box binding protein-1 (YBX1) is a multifunctional protein and often acts as an indicator of poor prognosis in cancers. Increasing evidence has shown that the levels of YBX1 protein were closely associated with multidrug resistance, relapse, metastasis and poor prognosis in cancers. However, its role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) metastasis remains unknown. In our study, we discovered that the expression of YBX1 was increased in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues. YBX1 protein levels positively correlated with T stage and metastasis of NPC patients. Moreover, expression of YBX1 was negatively correlated with membrane E-cadherin levels and positively correlated with Vimentin expression. In vitro, the expression of YBX1 was closely related to the invasive and migratory ability of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Knockdown of YBX1 inhibited migration and invasion in 5-8F cells, and over-expression of YBX1 promoted CNE1 cells migration and invasion. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) treatment led to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CNE1 cells accompanied by elevated YBX1 expression. On the contrary, knockdown of YBX1 partially inhibited the TGF-β1-induced CNE1 cell migration, together with changes of EMT-associated markers. Our study revealed that TGF-β1/YBX1 signaling might be one of novel mechanisms mediating EMT in NPC, providing a new target for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",1
29023674,"Reverse translational research takes a bedside-to-bench approach, using sophisticated basic research to explain the biological mechanisms behind observed clinical data. For transporters, which play a role in human disease and drug response, this approach offers a distinct advantage over the typical translational research, which often falters due to inadequate in vitro and preclinical animal models. Research on ABCG2, which encodes the Breast Cancer Resistance Protein, has benefited immensely from a reverse translational approach due to its broad implications for disease susceptibility and both therapeutic and adverse drug response. In this review, we describe the success of reverse translational research for ABCG2 and opportunities for further studies.",1
29021183,"In order for the first genomes to evolve, independent replicators had to act cooperatively, with some reducing their own replication rate to help copy others. It has been argued that limited diffusion explains this early cooperation. However, social evolution models have shown that limited diffusion on its own often does not favour cooperation. Here we model early replicators using social evolution tools. We show that: (i) replicators can be considered to be cooperating as a result of kin selection; (ii) limited diffusion on its own does not favour cooperation; and (iii) the addition of overlapping generations, probably a general trait of molecular replicators, promotes cooperation. These results suggest key life-history features in the evolution of the genome and that the same factors can favour cooperation across the entire tree of life.",0
29017048,"The origin of animals, one of the major transitions in evolution, remains mysterious. Many key aspects of animal evolution can be reconstructed by comparing living species within a robust phylogenetic framework. However, uncertainty remains regarding the evolutionary relationships between two ancient animal lineages - sponges and ctenophores - and the remaining animal phyla. Comparative morphology and some phylogenomic analyses support the view that sponges represent the sister lineage to the rest of the animals, while other phylogenomic analyses support ctenophores, a phylum of carnivorous, gelatinous marine organisms, as the sister lineage. Here, we explore why different studies yield different answers and discuss the implications of the two alternative hypotheses for understanding the origin of animals. Reconstruction of ancient evolutionary radiations is devilishly difficult and will likely require broader sampling of sponge and ctenophore genomes, improved analytical strategies and critical analyses of the phylogenetic distribution and molecular mechanisms underlying apparently conserved traits. Rather than staking out positions in favor of the ctenophores-sister or the sponges-sister hypothesis, we submit that research programs aimed at understanding the biology of the first animals should instead embrace the uncertainty surrounding early animal evolution in their experimental designs.",0
29016859,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting millions of children. Since treatment and prognosis of AIS depend on curve progression, identifying factors related to AIS curve progression is important in its management. Although several genetic loci for AIS occurrence are reported, no locus for curve progression has been identified. To identify genes associated with AIS progression, we conducted a genome-wide association study followed by a replication study using a total of 2,543 AIS subjects who were evaluated for the curve progression. We identified a significantly associated locus on chromosome 11q14.1 (P = 1.98 × 10-9, odds ratio = 1.56). In silico and in vitro analyses identified a functional variant, rs35333564 in MIR4300HG, the host gene of a microRNA, MIR4300. The genomic region containing rs35333564 had enhancer activity, which was decreased in its risk allele. Our data suggest that decrease of MIR4300 is related to AIS progression.",1
28992762,"Acute myeloid leukemia is characterized by its high biological and clinical heterogeneity, which represents an important barrier for a precise disease classification and accurate therapy. While epigenetic aberrations play a pivotal role in acute myeloid leukemia pathophysiology, molecular signatures such as change in the DNA methylation patterns and genetic mutations in enzymes needed to the methylation process can also be helpful for classifying acute myeloid leukemia. Our study aims to unveil the relevance of DNMT3A and TET2 genes in global and specific methylation patterns in acute myeloid leukemia. Peripheral blood samples from 110 untreated patients with acute myeloid leukemia and 15 healthy control individuals were collected. Global 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes were measured by using the MethylFlashTM Quantification kits. DNMT3A and TET2 expression levels were evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The R882A hotspot of DNMT3A and exons 6-10 of TET2 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced using the Sanger method. Methylation patterns of 16 gene promoters were evaluated by pyrosequencing after treating DNA with sodium bisulfite, and their transcriptional products were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Here, we demonstrate altered levels of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and highly variable transcript levels of DNMT3A and TET2 in peripheral blood leukocytes from acute myeloid leukemia patients. We found a mutation prevalence of 2.7% for DNMT3A and 11.8% for TET2 in the Mexican population with this disease. The average overall survival of acute myeloid leukemia patients with DNMT3A mutations was only 4 months. In addition, we showed that mutations in DNMT3A and TET2 may cause irregular DNA methylation patterns and transcriptional expression levels in 16 genes known to be involved in acute myeloid leukemia pathogenesis. Our findings suggest that alterations in DNMT3A and TET2 may be associated with acute myeloid leukemia prognosis. Furthermore, alterations in these enzymes affect normal methylation patterns in acute myeloid leukemia- specific genes, which in turn, may influence patient survival.",1

28977834,"WWOX (WW domain-containing oxidoreductase) is known to be an important tumor suppressor in cancer. In this study, we used samples from 201 osteosarcoma patients to investigate the effects of WWOX on angiogenesis and invasion. WWOX levels were negatively correlated with RUNX2 and VEGF levels, but were not correlated with OPN levels. Among the clinicopathological characteristics examined, WWOX was associated only with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and its expression in osteosarcoma tissues was a predictor of disease-free survival. WWOX promoted apoptosis and inhibited invasion and expression of bcl-2, OPN, RUNX2, and VEGF in osteosarcoma cells <i>in vitro</i>. In MG-63 cells, bcl-2 increased VEGF expression, while RUNX2 increased VEGF and OPN expression. Administration of DNA methylation inhibitors increased WWOX expression in MG-63 cells and methylation of WWOX gene promoter CpG island in the osteosarcoma of patients was associated with suppression of WWOX expression. Overexpression of WWOX in osteosarcoma cells inhibited tube formation in co-cultured HUVEC cells, and high WWOX expression was associated with decreased microvessel density (MVD). These results suggest that reduced WWOX expression in osteosarcoma inhibits apoptosis, promotes invasion and increases MVD.",1
28946373,"Quantitatively ascertaining and analyzing long-term responses of crop yield and nitrate leaching on varying irrigation and fertilization treatments are focal points for guaranteeing crop yield and reducing nitrogen loss. The calibrated agricultural-hydrological RZWQM2 model was used to explore the long-term (2003-2013) transport processes of water and nitrogen and the nitrate leaching amount into groundwater in summer maize and winter wheat rotation field in typical intensive plant area in the North China Plain, Daxing district of Beijing. Simulation results showed that application rates of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer have couple effects on crop yields and nitrogen leaching of root zone. When both the irrigation and fertilizer for summer maize and winter wheat were 400mm and 400kgNha<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, nitrate leaching into groundwater accounted for 47.9% of application amount of nitrogen fertilizer. When application amount of irrigation is 200mm and fertilization is 200kgNha<sup>-1</sup>, NUPE (nitrogen uptake efficiency), NUE (nitrogen use efficiency), NPFP (nitrogen partial factor productivity), and W<sub>pi</sub> (irrigation water productive efficiency) were in general higher than that under other irrigation and fertilization condition (irrigation from 104-400mm, fertilizer 104-400kgNha<sup>-1</sup>). Irrigation bigger than 200mm could shorten the response time of nitrate leaching in deeper soil layer in different irrigation treatment.",0
28944908,"Endometrial carcinoma is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract and is the fourth most common malignancy among women worldwide. Endometrial adenocarcinoma (EAC) accounts for ~80% of endometrial carcinoma cases. Numerous critical genetic events have been determined to serve an essential role in EAC progression; however, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying EAC progression remain unclear. Pyrosequencing and methylation‑specific PCR were used to detect the methylation status of Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1). Immunohistochemistry and western blot were used to detect the expression of WIF1, Wnt family member 1 and other related pathways. The anticancer role of WIF1 in EAC was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Two of the three EAC cases exhibited significantly high methylation in five CpG sites, and the WIF1 methylation rate in EAC and endometrial tissues was 43.4 and 8%, respectively (P<0.05). The kappa consistency coefficient was ‑0.369 between methylation and mRNA expression (P<0.05) and WIF1 expression levels were significantly downregulated in EAC tissues compared with non‑tumorous tissues (P<0.01). The 5‑year overall survival rates were significantly lower for patients with tumors that negatively expressed WIF1 when compared with the 77.9% exhibited by those with positive WIF1 expression. Furthermore, the proliferation rate of KLE cells was significantly reduced following 5‑aza‑20‑deoxycytidine treatment or WIF1 overexpression in vitro and in vivo, which may be associated with downregulated c‑Myc and phosphorylated‑extracellular signal‑regulated kinase expression. These results demonstrated the important role of WIF1 in EAC tumorigenesis, and suggested that WIF1 may be a potential drug target in EAC treatment.",1

The assumption that ""genetically engineered"" or ""genetically modified"" is a meaningful - and dangerous - classification has led to excessive and dilatory regulation. The modern molecular techniques are an extension, or refinement, of older, less precise, less predictable methods of genetic modification, but as long as today's activists and regulators remain convinced that so called ""GMOs"" represent a distinct and dangerous category of research and products, genetic engineering will fall short of its potential.",0
28924228,"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) affects 1/140 UK pregnancies; with pruritus, hepatic impairment and elevated serum bile acids. Severe disease is complicated by spontaneous preterm delivery and stillbirth. Previous studies have reported mutations in hepatocellular transporters (ABCB4, ABCB11). High throughput sequencing in 147 patients was performed in the transporters ABCB4, ABCB11, ATP8B1, ABCC2 and tight junction protein 2 (TJP2). Twenty-six potentially damaging variants were identified with the following predicted protein changes: Twelve ABCB4 mutations - Arg47Gln, Met113Val, Glu161Gly, Thr175Ala, Glu528Glyfs*6, Arg590Gln, Ala601Ser, Glu884Ter, Gly722Ala, Tyr775Met (x2), Trp854Ter. Four potential ABCB11 mutations - Glu297Gly (x3) and a donor splice site mutation (intron 19). Five potential ATP8B1 mutations - Asn45Thr (x3), and two others, Glu114Gln and Lys203Glu. Two ABCC2 mutations - Glu1352Ala and a duplication (exons 24 and 25). Three potential mutations were identified in TJP2; Thr62Met (x2) and Thr626Ser. No patient harboured more than one mutation. All were heterozygous. An additional 545 cases were screened for the potential recurrent mutations of ATP8B1 (Asn45Thr) and TJP2 (Thr62Met) identifying three further occurrences of Asn45Thr. This study has expanded known mutations in ABCB4 and ABCB11 and identified roles in ICP for mutations in ATP8B1 and ABCC2. Possible novel mutations in TJP2 were also discovered.",1
28923487,"Novelty and innovation are fundamental yet relatively understudied concepts in evolution. We may study the history and provenance of novelty using phylogenetics, where key questions include when evolution occurs by tree-like branching and when it occurs by movement of distantly related parts in processes akin to horizontal transfer. Perfectly vertical inheritance, often an assumption of evolutionary trees, requires simultaneous co-duplication of the parts of a duplicating or speciating (processes I collectively call 'furcating') biological feature. However, simultaneous co-duplication of many parts usually requires variational processes that are rare. Therefore, instead of always being perfectly tree-like, evolution often involves events that incorporate or fuse more distantly related parts into new units during evolution, which herein I call 'fusion'. Exon shuffling, horizontal gene transfer, introgression, and co-option are such fusion processes at different levels of organization. The ubiquity of processes that fuse distantly related parts has wide ranging implications for the study of macroevolution. For one, the central metaphor of a tree of life will often be incomplete, to the point where we may consider a different metaphor, such as economic public goods, or a 'web of life'. Secondly, we often may need to expand commonly used phylogenetic models and methods, highlighting a need for an expansive toolkit for studying evolutionary history. Even though furcation - the splitting and individuation of biological features - does happen, fusion of distant parts may often be just as critical for the evolution of novelties, and must formally be incorporated into the metaphors, models, and visualization of evolutionary history. This will allow us to understand the timing, order of appearance, and diversification rates of developmental systems, including cell types, organs, behavior, and language, which very commonly evolve through co-option.",0
28916789,"Although A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 8 (ADAM8) is not crucial for tissue development and homeostasis, it has been implicated in various inflammatory diseases by regulating processes like immune cell recruitment and activation. ADAM8 expression has been associated with human atherosclerosis development and myocardial infarction, however a causal role of ADAM8 in atherosclerosis has not been investigated thus far. In this study, we examined the expression of ADAM8 in early and progressed human atherosclerotic lesions, in which ADAM8 was significantly upregulated in vulnerable lesions. In addition, ADAM8 expression was most prominent in the shoulder region of human atherosclerotic lesions, characterized by the abundance of foam cells. In mice, Adam8 was highly expressed in circulating neutrophils and in macrophages. Moreover, ADAM8 deficient mouse macrophages displayed reduced secretion of inflammatory mediators. Remarkably, however, neither hematopoietic nor whole-body ADAM8 deficiency in mice affected atherosclerotic lesion size. Additionally, except for an increase in granulocyte content in plaques of ADAM8 deficient mice, lesion morphology was unaffected. Taken together, whole body and hematopoietic ADAM8 does not contribute to advanced atherosclerotic plaque development, at least in female mice, although its expression might still be valuable as a diagnostic/prognostic biomarker to distinguish between stable and unstable lesions.",1
28911233,"CRISPR/Cas9 system has accelerated research across many fields since its demonstration for genome editing. CRISPR also offers vast therapeutic potential, but an important hurdle of this technology is the off-target mutations it can induce. In this viewpoint, we will discuss recent strategies for improving CRISPR specificity, emphasizing how a complete mechanistic understanding of CRISPR/Cas9 can benefit such efforts. We also propose that agreeing upon a consensus protocol with the highest specificity could benefit researchers working on CRISPR-based therapies. In addition to improving CRISPR/Cas9 specificity, accurate detection of off-target events is also crucial, and we will discuss various unbiased off-target detection methods in terms of their advantages and disadvantages. We suggest that using a combination of cell-based and cell-free methods can prove more useful. In addition, we point out that improving predictive algorithms for off-target sites would require pooling of the available off-target analysis data and standardization of the protocols used for obtaining the data. Moreover, we highlight the risk of insertional mutagenesis for gene correction applications requiring the use of donor DNA. We conclude by discussing future prospects for the field, as well as steps that can be taken to overcome the aforementioned challenges.",0

28887439,"BACKGROUND Recently, accumulating studies have found that ACSL4 dysregulation is related to a great number of malignant tumors. The purpose of the present study was to explore the relationship between ACSL4 expression level and clinical prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS The Oncomine and TCGA databases were used to predict the expression of ACSL4 mRNA in HCC and its association with HCC prognosis. Further, immunohistochemistry was performed to verify the ACSL4 protein expression in 116 paired HCC and adjacent normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier and cox analysis were performed to validate the correlation between ACSL4 expression and HCC prognosis. RESULTS We first used the Oncomine database to find that ACSL4 mRNA expression level was significantly higher in HCC tissues than that in normal tissues (p all <0.001). The results were consistent with those in the TCGA database. Then, immunohistochemical results demonstrated that the ACSL4 positive expression rate was 70.7% in HCC tissues. ACSL4 differential expression level was significantly related to Edmondson grade (p=0.010), AFP (p=0.001) and TNM stage (p=0.012). Survival analysis revealed that both overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) time were remarkably reduced in HCC patients with ACSL4 high expression (p=0.001 and 0.000, respectively). Moreover, Cox multivariate analysis demonstrated that ACSL4 expression was the only independent prognostic factor for both OS and DFS (both p values=0.001). CONCLUSIONS Taken together, our study demonstrated that ACSL4 was overexpressed in HCC, and it will be a new potential therapeutic target for HCC as an independent adverse prognostic parameter.",1

28881752,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most lethal human malignant tumor, with a dismal 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. The lack of specific symptoms at early tumor stages and the paucity of biomarkers contribute to the poor diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. To improve prognosis, a screening biomarker for early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is in urgent need. We searched the databases of expression profiling by array on GEO, aiming at comparing gene expression profile of matched pairs of pancreatic tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues, and we screen out 4 suitable series of gene expression microarray data (""GSE15471"", ""GSE18670"", ""GSE28735"" and ""GSE58561""). After carefully analyzing, 13 DEGs (MYOF, SLC6A6, S100P, HK2, IFI44L, OSBPL3, IGF2BP3, PDK4, IL1R2, ERO1A, EGLN3, PLAC8 and ACSL5) are significantly differentially expressed in four microarray databases in common. After analyzing mRNA expression data and clinical follow-up survey provided in the TCGA database and clinicopathological data of 137 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients, we carefully demonstrated that three of these differentially expressed genes (ERO1A, OSBPL3 and IFI44L) are correlated with poor prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients. In addition, we revealed that cell-matrix adhesion and extracellular matrix were top significantly regulated pathways in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and depicted two protein-protein interactions networks of extracellular matrix related Genes which are dysregulated according to 4 gene expression microarray data mentioned above (""GSE15471"", ""GSE18670"", ""GSE28735"" and ""GSE58561""), hoping to shed light on the etiology of PDAC and mechanisms of drug resistance in PDAC in this study.",1
28880480,"Lipid metabolism dysregulation underlies chronic pathologies such as obesity, diabetes and cancer. Besides their role in structure and energy storage, lipids are also important signalling molecules regulating multiple biological functions. Thus, understanding the precise lipid metabolism enzymatic steps that are altered in some pathological conditions is helpful for designing better treatment strategies. Several monoacylglycerol (MAG) species are only recently being recognized as signalling lipid molecules in different tissues. Recent studies indicated the importance of the ubiquitously expressed serine hydrolase α/β-hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6), which is a MAG hydrolase, in regulating signalling competent MAG in both central and peripheral tissues. The central and peripheral function of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol, which is a 2-MAG, and its breakdown by both ABHD6 and classical MAG lipase has been well documented. ABHD6 and its substrate MAG appear to be involved in the regulation of various physiological and pathological processes including insulin secretion, adipose browning, food intake, neurotransmission, autoimmune disorders, neurological and metabolic diseases as well as cancer. Diverse cellular targets such as mammalian unc13-1 (Munc13-1), PPARs, GPR119 and CB1/2 receptors, for MAG-mediated signalling processes have been proposed in different cell types. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the current state of knowledge regarding ABHD6/MAG signalling and its possible therapeutic implications.",1
28869610,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common human cancer, results from aberrant activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Although most cases of BCC are sporadic, some forms are inherited, such as Bazex-Dupré-Christol syndrome (BDCS)-a cancer-prone genodermatosis with an X-linked, dominant inheritance pattern. We have identified mutations in the ACTRT1 gene, which encodes actin-related protein T1 (ARP-T1), in two of the six families with BDCS that were examined in this study. High-throughput sequencing in the four remaining families identified germline mutations in noncoding sequences surrounding ACTRT1. These mutations were located in transcribed sequences encoding enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and were shown to impair enhancer activity and ACTRT1 expression. ARP-T1 was found to directly bind to the GLI1 promoter, thus inhibiting GLI1 expression, and loss of ARP-T1 led to activation of the Hedgehog pathway in individuals with BDCS. Moreover, exogenous expression of ACTRT1 reduced the in vitro and in vivo proliferation rates of cell lines with aberrant activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. In summary, our study identifies a disease mechanism in BCC involving mutations in regulatory noncoding elements and uncovers the tumor-suppressor properties of ACTRT1.",1
28867142,"Genetic risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have yet to be fully elucidated. Postzygotic mosaic mutations (PMMs) have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders and overgrowth syndromes. By leveraging whole-exome sequencing data on a large family-based ASD cohort, the Simons Simplex Collection, we systematically evaluated the potential role of PMMs in autism risk. Initial re-evaluation of published single-nucleotide variant (SNV) de novo mutations showed evidence consistent with putative PMMs for 11% of mutations. We developed a robust and sensitive SNV PMM calling approach integrating complementary callers, logistic regression modeling, and additional heuristics. In our high-confidence call set, we identified 470 PMMs in children, increasing the proportion of mosaic SNVs to 22%. Probands have a significant burden of synonymous PMMs and these mutations are enriched for computationally predicted impacts on splicing. Evidence of increased missense PMM burden was not seen in the full cohort. However, missense burden signal increased in subcohorts of families where probands lacked nonsynonymous germline mutations, especially in genes intolerant to mutations. Parental mosaic mutations that were transmitted account for 6.8% of the presumed de novo mutations in the children. PMMs were identified in previously implicated high-confidence neurodevelopmental disorder risk genes, such as CHD2, CTNNB1, SCN2A, and SYNGAP1, as well as candidate risk genes with predicted functions in chromatin remodeling or neurodevelopment, including ACTL6B, BAZ2B, COL5A3, SSRP1, and UNC79. We estimate that PMMs potentially contribute risk to 3%-4% of simplex ASD case subjects and future studies of PMMs in ASD and related disorders are warranted.",1
28865129,"The cell-based therapies could be potential methods to treat damaged cartilage tissues. Instead of native hyaline cartilage, the current therapies generate mainly weaker fibrocartilage-type of repair tissue. A correct microenvironment influences the cellular phenotype, and together with external factors it can be used, for example, to aid the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to defined types of differentiated adult cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of long-term exposure to 5% low oxygen atmosphere on human chondrosarcoma HCS-2/8 cells. This atmosphere is close to normal oxygen tension of cartilage tissue. The proteome was analyzed with label-free mass spectrometric method and further bioinformatic analysis. The qRT-PCR method was used to gene expression analysis, and ELISA and dimethylmethylene blue assays for type II collagen and sulfated glycosaminoglycan measurements. The 5% oxygen atmosphere did not influence cell proliferation, but enhanced slightly ACAN and COL2A1 gene expression. Proteomic screening revealed a number of low oxygen-induced protein level responses. Increased ones included NDUFA4L2, P4HA1, NDRG1, MIF, LDHA, PYGL, while TXNRD1, BAG2, TXN2, AQSTM1, TNFRSF1B, and EPHX1 decreased during the long-term low oxygen atmosphere. Also a number of proteins previously not related to low oxygen tension changed during the treatment. Of those S100P, RPSS26, NDUFB11, CDV3, and TUBB8 had elevated levels, while ALCAM, HLA-B, EIF1, and ACOT9 were lower in the samples cultured at low oxygen tension. In conclusion, low oxygen condition causes changes in the cellular amounts of several proteins.",1

A key unanswered question in SCA3 and other polyglutamine diseases is the extent to which neurodegeneration is mediated through gain-of-function versus loss-of-function. To address this question in SCA3, we performed transcriptional profiling on the brainstem, a highly vulnerable brain region in SCA3, in a series of mouse models with varying degrees of ATXN3 expression and aggregation. We include two SCA3 knock-in mouse models: our previously published model that erroneously harbors a tandem duplicate of the CAG repeat-containing exon, and a corrected model, introduced here. Both models exhibit dose-dependent neuronal accumulation and aggregation of mutant ATXN3, but do not exhibit a behavioral phenotype. We identified a molecular signature that correlates with ATXN3 neuronal aggregation yet is primarily linked to oligodendrocytes, highlighting early white matter dysfunction in SCA3. Two robustly elevated oligodendrocyte transcripts, Acy3 and Tnfrsf13c, were confirmed as elevated at the protein level in SCA3 human disease brainstem. To determine if mutant ATXN3 acts on oligodendrocytes cell-autonomously, we manipulated the repeat expansion in the variant SCA3 knock-in mouse by cell-type specific Cre/LoxP recombination. Changes in oligodendrocyte transcripts are driven cell-autonomously and occur independent of neuronal ATXN3 aggregation. Our findings support a primary toxic gain of function mechanism and highlight a previously unrecognized role for oligodendrocyte dysfunction in SCA3 disease pathogenesis.",1
28830093,"Lactococcus lactis is a major microbe. This lactic acid bacterium (LAB) is used worldwide in the production of safe, healthy, tasteful and nutritious milk fermentation products. Its huge industrial importance has led to an explosion of research on the organism, particularly since the early 1970s. The upsurge in the research on L. lactis coincided not accidentally with the advent of recombinant DNA technology in these years. The development of methods to take out and re-introduce DNA in L. lactis, to clone genes and to mutate the chromosome in a targeted way, to control (over)expression of proteins and, ultimately, the availability of the nucleotide sequence of its genome and the use of that information in transcriptomics and proteomics research have enabled to peek deep into the functioning of the organism. Among many other things, this has provided an unprecedented view of the major gene regulatory pathways involved in nitrogen and carbon metabolism and their overlap, and has led to the blossoming of the field of L. lactis systems biology. All of these advances have made L. lactis the paradigm of the LAB. This review will deal with the exciting path along which the research on the genetics of and gene regulation in L. lactis has trodden.",0
28827371,"NOTCH signaling exerts essential roles in normal and malignant intestinal physiology and the homeostasis of cancer stem-like cells (CSC), but the basis for this latter role remains obscure. The signaling scaffold protein STRAP is upregulated in several cancers, where it promotes tumorigenicity and metastasis. Here we report a novel oncogenic function for STRAP in maintaining CSC subpopulations in a heterogeneous mixture by antagonizing formation of the chromatin modifier PRC2 and by epigenetically activating NOTCH signals in human colorectal cancer. Silencing STRAP sensitized colorectal cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> STRAP depletion also contributed to a reduced stem-like phenotype of colorectal cancer cells, as indicated by reduced expression of the CSC signature and NOTCH signaling regulators <i>in vitro</i> and by diminished tumorigenesis <i>in vivo</i> Genes encoding some upstream activators of NOTCH were highly enriched for H3K27me3, which forms repressive chromatin domains upon STRAP silencing. Mechanistically, STRAP competitively disrupted association of the PRC2 subunits EZH2 and SUZ12, thereby inhibiting PRC2 assembly. Restoring the NOTCH pathway by lentiviral expression of NICD1 or HES1 in STRAP-depleted tumor cells reversed the CSC phenotype. In 90 colorectal cancer clinical specimens, a significant positive correlation was documented between the expression of STRAP and HES1. Overall, our findings illuminated a novel STRAP-NOTCH1-HES1 molecular axis as a CSC regulator in colorectal cancer, with potential implications to improve treatment of this disease. <i>Cancer Res; 77(20); 5464-78. ©2017 AACR</i>.",1
28827091,"Mutations in the gene encoding comparative gene identification 58 (CGI-58), also known as α β hydrolase domain-containing 5 (ABHD5), cause neutral lipid storage disorder with ichthyosis (NLSDI). This inborn error in metabolism is characterized by ectopic accumulation of triacylglycerols (TAG) within cytoplasmic lipid droplets in multiple cell types. Studies over the past decade have clearly demonstrated that CGI-58 is a potent regulator of TAG hydrolysis in the disease-relevant cell types. However, despite the reproducible genetic link between CGI-58 mutations and TAG storage, the molecular mechanisms by which CGI-58 regulates TAG hydrolysis are still incompletely understood. It is clear that CGI-58 can regulate TAG hydrolysis by activating the major TAG hydrolase adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), yet CGI-58 can also regulate lipid metabolism via mechanisms that do not involve ATGL. This review highlights recent progress made in defining the physiologic and biochemical function of CGI-58, and its broader role in energy homeostasis.

28813679,"Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that may facilitate the selective elimination of tumor cells. The tumor suppressor p53 (TP53) has been demonstrated to promote ferroptosis via a transcription-dependent mechanism. Here, we show that TP53 limits erastin-induced ferroptosis by blocking dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP4) activity in a transcription-independent manner. Loss of TP53 prevents nuclear accumulation of DPP4 and thus facilitates plasma-membrane-associated DPP4-dependent lipid peroxidation, which finally results in ferroptosis. These findings reveal a direct molecular link between TP53 and DPP4 in the control of lipid metabolism and may provide a precision medicine strategy for the treatment of colorectal cancer by induction of ferroptosis.",1
28809852,"Genome-wide association studies, which detect the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and disease susceptibility, have been extensively applied to study attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but genome-wide significant associations have not been found yet. Genetic heterogeneity and insufficient genomic coverage may account for the missing heritability. We performed a two-stage association study for ADHD in the Han Chinese population. In the discovery stage, 1033 ADHD patients and 950 healthy controls were genotyped using both the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 and the Illumina Infinium HumanExome BeadChip. The genotyped SNPs were combined to generate a powerful SNP set with better genomic coverage especially for the nonsynonymous variants. In addition to the association of single SNPs, we collected adjacent SNPs as SNP sets, which were determined by either genes or successive sliding windows, to evaluate their synergetic effect. The candidate susceptibility SNPs were further replicated in an independent cohort of 1441 ADHD patients and 1447 healthy controls. No genome-wide significant SNPs or gene-based SNP sets were found to be associated with ADHD. However, two continuous sliding windows located in ITGA1 (P-value=8.33E-7 and P-value=8.43E-7) were genome-wide significant. The quantitative trait analyses also demonstrated their association with ADHD core symptoms and executive functions. The association was further validated by follow-up replications for four selected SNPs: rs1979398 (P-value=2.64E-6), rs16880453 (P-value=3.58E-4), rs1531545 (P-value=7.62E-4) and rs4074793 (P-value=2.03E-4). Our results suggest that genetic variants in ITGA1 may be involved in the etiology of ADHD and the SNP-set based analysis is a promising strategy for the detection of underlying genetic risk factors.",1
28805671,"The primary function of the skin is to act as a barrier against insults from the environment, and its unique structure reflects this. The skin is composed of two layers: the epidermal outer layer is highly cellular and provides the barrier function, and the inner dermal layer ensures strength and elasticity and gives nutritional support to the epidermis. Normal skin contains high concentrations of vitamin C, which supports important and well-known functions, stimulating collagen synthesis and assisting in antioxidant protection against UV-induced photodamage. This knowledge is often used as a rationale for the addition of vitamin C to topical applications, but the efficacy of such treatment, as opposed to optimising dietary vitamin C intake, is poorly understood. This review discusses the potential roles for vitamin C in skin health and summarises the in vitro and in vivo research to date. We compare the efficacy of nutritional intake of vitamin C versus topical application, identify the areas where lack of evidence limits our understanding of the potential benefits of vitamin C on skin health, and suggest which skin properties are most likely to benefit from improved nutritional vitamin C intake.",0
28792001,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have contributed significantly to the understanding of complex disease genetics. However, GWAS only report association signals and do not necessarily identify culprit genes. As most signals occur in non-coding regions of the genome, it is often challenging to assign genomic variants to the underlying causal mechanism(s). Topologically associating domains (TADs) are primarily cell-type-independent genomic regions that define interactome boundaries and can aid in the designation of limits within which an association most likely impacts gene function. We describe and validate a computational method that uses the genic content of TADs to prioritize candidate genes. Our method, called 'TAD_Pathways', performs a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis over genes that reside within TAD boundaries corresponding to GWAS signals for a given trait or disease. Applying our pipeline to the bone mineral density (BMD) GWAS catalog, we identify 'Skeletal System Development' (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P=1.02x10<sup>-5</sup>) as the top-ranked pathway. In many cases, our method implicated a gene other than the nearest gene. Our molecular experiments describe a novel example: ACP2, implicated near the canonical 'ARHGAP1' locus. We found ACP2 to be an important regulator of osteoblast metabolism, whereas ARHGAP1 was not supported. Our results via BMD, for example, demonstrate how basic principles of three-dimensional genome organization can define biologically informed association windows.",1

28780023,"Gain-of-function mutations in the Type I Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) receptor ACVR1 have been identified in two diseases: Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP), a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by genetically driven heterotopic ossification, and in 20-25% of Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas (DIPGs), a pediatric brain tumor with no effective therapies and dismal median survival. While the ACVR1 mutation is causal for FOP, its role in DIPG tumor biology remains under active investigation. Here, we discuss cross-fertilization between the FOP and DIPG fields, focusing on the biological mechanisms and principles gleaned from FOP that can be applied to DIPG biology. We highlight our current knowledge of ACVR1 in both diseases, and then describe the growing opportunities and barriers to effectively investigate ACVR1 in DIPG. Importantly, learning from other seemingly unrelated diseases harboring similar mutations may uncover novel mechanisms or processes for future investigation.",1
28758906,"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare and intractable disease characterized by extraskeletal bone formation through endochondral ossification. Patients with FOP harbor point mutations in ACVR1, a type I receptor for BMPs. Although mutated ACVR1 (FOP-ACVR1) has been shown to render hyperactivity in BMP signaling, we and others have uncovered a mechanism by which FOP-ACVR1 mistransduces BMP signaling in response to Activin-A, a molecule that normally transduces TGF-β signaling. Although Activin-A evokes enhanced chondrogenesis in vitro and heterotopic ossification (HO) in vivo, the underlying mechanisms have yet to be revealed. To this end, we developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) system using FOP patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (FOP-iPSCs) to identify pivotal pathways in enhanced chondrogenesis that are initiated by Activin-A. In a screen of 6,809 small-molecule compounds, we identified mTOR signaling as a critical pathway for the aberrant chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stromal cells derived from FOP-iPSCs (FOP-iMSCs). Two different HO mouse models, an FOP model mouse expressing FOP-ACVR1 and an FOP-iPSC-based HO model mouse, revealed critical roles for mTOR signaling in vivo. Moreover, we identified ENPP2, an enzyme that generates lysophosphatidic acid, as a linker of FOP-ACVR1 and mTOR signaling in chondrogenesis. These results uncovered the crucial role of the Activin-A/FOP-ACVR1/ENPP2/mTOR axis in FOP pathogenesis.",1

28739976,"Elevated blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and has a substantial genetic contribution. Genetic variation influencing blood pressure has the potential to identify new pharmacological targets for the treatment of hypertension.

You will be familiar with the situation, you are in a seminar or a meeting and someone who has been using a set of acronyms for years, includes them in sentence after sentence that has you lost because you don't know what some or most of them stand for. Even worse when scientists start making verbs out of them, CRISPR seems to have fallen into this category; how many of us have heard someone asking if a mutation can be CRISPRed! Does it matter though? We are all familiar with informal language in scientific talks and discussions which is replaced by more formal dialect when research is published or presented to the general public.

28724083,"The wheat stem sawfly (WSS) is an economically important pest of wheat in the Northern Great Plains. The primary means of WSS control is resistance associated with the single quantitative trait locus (QTL) , which controls most stem solidness variation. The goal of this study was to identify stem solidness candidate genes via RNA-seq. This study made use of 28 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) makers derived from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) linked to contained within a 5.13 cM region. Allele specific expression of EST markers was examined in stem tissue for solid and hollow-stemmed pairs of two spring wheat near isogenic lines (NILs) differing for the QTL. Of the 28 ESTs, 13 were located within annotated genes and 10 had detectable stem expression. Annotated genes corresponding to four of the ESTs were differentially expressed between solid and hollow-stemmed NILs and represent possible stem solidness gene candidates. Further examination of the 5.13 cM region containing the 28 EST markers identified 260 annotated genes. Twenty of the 260 linked genes were up-regulated in hollow NIL stems, while only seven genes were up-regulated in solid NIL stems. An -methyltransferase within the region of interest was identified as a candidate based on differential expression between solid and hollow-stemmed NILs and putative function. Further study of these candidate genes may lead to the identification of the gene(s) controlling stem solidness and an increased ability to select for wheat stem solidness and manage WSS.",0
28717021,"Diatoms have attracted considerable attention due to their success in diverse environmental conditions, which probably is a consequence of their complex origins. Studies of their metabolism will provide insight into their adaptation capacity and are a prerequisite for metabolic engineering. Several years of investigation have led to the development of the genome engineering tools required for such studies, and a profusion of appropriate tools is now available for exploring and exploiting the metabolism of these organisms. Diatoms are highly prized in industrial biotechnology, due to both their richness in natural lipids and carotenoids and their ability to produce recombinant proteins, of considerable value in diverse markets. This review provides an overview of recent advances in genetic engineering methods for diatoms, from the development of gene expression cassettes and gene delivery methods, to cutting-edge genome-editing technologies. It also highlights the contributions of these rapid developments to both basic and applied research: they have improved our understanding of key physiological processes; and they have made it possible to modify the natural metabolism to favour the production of specific compounds or to produce new compounds for green chemistry and pharmaceutical applications.This article is part of the themed issue 'The peculiar carbon metabolism in diatoms'.",0

Whereas ADAM17 function in EGF-R-, in Interleukin-6 (IL-6)- and in TNFα-biology has been shown to play a decisive role in regulation of the immune system as well as cancer development, the role of ADAM17 in the central nervous system and neurodegeneration still remains elusive.

28678712,"The supertree problem asking for a tree displaying a set of consistent input trees has been largely considered for the reconstruction of species trees. Here, we rather explore this framework for the sake of reconstructing a gene tree from a set of input gene trees on partial data. In this perspective, the phylogenetic tree for the species containing the genes of interest can be used to choose among the many possible compatible ""supergenetrees"", the most natural criteria being to minimize a reconciliation cost. We develop a variety of algorithmic solutions for the construction and correction of gene trees using the supertree framework. A dynamic programming supertree algorithm for constructing or correcting gene trees, exponential in the number of input trees, is first developed for the less constrained version of the problem. It is then adapted to gene trees with nodes labeled as duplication or speciation, the additional constraint being to preserve the orthology and paralogy relations between genes. Then, a quadratic time algorithm is developed for efficiently correcting an initial gene tree while preserving a set of ""trusted"" subtrees, as well as the relative phylogenetic distance between them, in both cases of labeled or unlabeled input trees. By applying these algorithms to the set of Ensembl gene trees, we show that this new correction framework is particularly useful to correct weakly-supported duplication nodes.

28653169,"In 2015 scientists called for a partial ban on genome editing in human germline cells. This call was a response to the rapid development of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, a molecular tool that allows researchers to modify genomic DNA in living organisms with high precision and ease of use. Importantly, the ban was meant to be a trust-building exercise that promises a 'prudent' way forward. The goal of this paper is to analyse whether the ban can deliver on this promise. To do so the focus will be put on the precedent on which the current ban is modelled, namely the Asilomar ban on recombinant DNA technology. The analysis of this case will show (a) that the Asilomar ban was successful because of a specific two-step containment strategy it employed and (b) that this two-step approach is also key to making the current ban work. It will be argued, however, that the Asilomar strategy cannot be transferred to human genome editing and that the current ban therefore fails to deliver on its promise. The paper will close with a reflection on the reasons for this failure and on what can be learned from it about the regulation of novel molecular tools.",0

28604676,"Ubiquitin linkage to cysteine is an unconventional modification targeting protein for degradation. However, the physiological regulation of cysteine ubiquitylation is still mysterious. Here we found that ACAT2, a cellular enzyme converting cholesterol and fatty acid to cholesteryl esters, was ubiquitylated on Cys277 for degradation when the lipid level was low. gp78-Insigs catalysed Lys48-linked polyubiquitylation on this Cys277. A high concentration of cholesterol and fatty acid, however, induced cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) that oxidized Cys277, resulting in ACAT2 stabilization and subsequently elevated cholesteryl esters. Furthermore, ACAT2 knockout mice were more susceptible to high-fat diet-associated insulin resistance. By contrast, expression of a constitutively stable form of ACAT2 (C277A) resulted in higher insulin sensitivity. Together, these data indicate that lipid-induced stabilization of ACAT2 ameliorates lipotoxicity from excessive cholesterol and fatty acid. This unconventional cysteine ubiquitylation of ACAT2 constitutes an important mechanism for sensing lipid-overload-induced ROS and fine-tuning lipid homeostasis.",1
28600779,"In this study, we report the experience of the only reference clinical next-generation sequencing lab in Saudi Arabia with the first 1000 families who span a wide-range of suspected Mendelian phenotypes. A total of 1019 tests were performed in the period of March 2016-December 2016 comprising 972 solo (index only), 14 duo (parents or affected siblings only), and 33 trio (index and parents). Multigene panels accounted for 672 tests, while whole exome sequencing (WES) represented the remaining 347 tests. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants that explain the clinical indications were identified in 34% (27% in panels and 43% in exomes), spanning 279 genes and including 165 novel variants. While recessive mutations dominated the landscape of solved cases (71% of mutations, and 97% of which are homozygous), a substantial minority (27%) were solved on the basis of dominant mutations. The highly consanguineous nature of the study population also facilitated homozygosity for many private mutations (only 32.5% of the recessive mutations are founder), as well as the first instances of recessive inheritance of previously assumed strictly dominant disorders (involving ITPR1, VAMP1, MCTP2, and TBP). Surprisingly, however, dual molecular diagnosis was only observed in 1.5% of cases.

Two of these genes were independently mutated in more than one family with similar phenotypes, which substantiates their link to human disease (AKAP6 in intellectual disability and UBR4 in early dementia).

28599093,"We report the clinical and molecular cytogenetic characterization of four unrelated patients from France and Spain, carrying 2p14 microdeletions and presenting with intellectual disability and dysmorphisms. 2p14 microdeletions are very rare. Seven patients have been reported so far harboring deletions including 2p14p15 and encompassing OTX1, whose haploinsufficiency is frequently associated with genitourinary defects. To date, only one patient has been reported carrying a more proximal 2p14 microdeletion which does not include OTX1. Here, we report three further patients carrying proximal 2p14 microdeletions not including OTX1 and one patient carrying a more distal 2p14p15 microdeletion including this gene, providing new insights into the associated phenotypic spectrum. First, our study and a review of the literature showed that 3/4 patients carrying proximal 2p14 microdeletions had sensorineural hearing loss, suggesting the presence of a previously unreported deafness-causing gene in this chromosomal region. Second, one patient developed a progressive cardiomyopathy, suggesting that a cardiac follow-up should be systematically warranted even in the absence of congenital heart disease. We speculate that ACTR2 and MEIS1 might respectively play a role in the pathogenesis of the observed deafness and cardiomyopathy. Third, we observed other previously unreported features such as glaucoma, retinopathy, and mild midline abnormalities including short corpus callosum, hypospadias and anteriorly placed anus. Finally, the patient carrying a 2p14p15 deletion including OTX1 had normal kidneys and genitalia, thus confirming that OTX1 haploinsufficiency is not invariably associated with genitourinary defects. In conclusion, our study contributes significantly to delineate the phenotypic spectrum of 2p14 microdeletions.",1
28598419,"Preterm birth (PTB) contributes significantly to infant mortality and morbidity with lifelong impact. Few robust genetic factors of PTB have been identified. Such 'missing heritability' may be partly due to gene × environment interactions (G × E), which is largely unexplored. Here we conduct genome-wide G × E analyses of PTB in 1,733 African-American women (698 mothers of PTB; 1,035 of term birth) from the Boston Birth Cohort. We show that maternal COL24A1 variants have a significant genome-wide interaction with maternal pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity on PTB risk, with rs11161721 (P<sub>G × E</sub>=1.8 × 10<sup>-8</sup>; empirical P<sub>G × E</sub>=1.2 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) as the top hit.

28596294,"Alveolar leukocyte recruitment is a hallmark of acute lung inflammation and involves transmigration of leukocytes through endothelial and epithelial layers. The disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) 8 is expressed on human isolated leukocytic cells and can be further upregulated on cultured endothelial and epithelial cells by proinflammatory cytokines. By shRNA-mediated knockdown we show that leukocytic ADAM8 is required on monocytic THP-1 cells for chemokine-induced chemotaxis as well as transendothelial and transepithelial migration. Furthermore, ADAM8 promotes α<sub>L</sub>-integrin upregulation and THP-1 cell adhesion to endothelial cells. On endothelial cells ADAM8 enhances transendothelial migration and increases cytokine-induced permeability. On epithelial cells the protease facilitates migration in a wound closure assay but does not affect transepithelial leukocyte migration. Blood leukocytes and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from ADAM8-deficient mice show suppressed chemotactic response. Intranasal application of LPS to mice is accompanied with ADAM8 upregulation in the lung. In this model of acute lung inflammation ADAM8-deficient mice are protected against leukocyte infiltration. Finally, transfer experiments of BMDM in mice indicate that ADAM8 exerts a promigratory function predominantly on leukocytes. Our study provides in vitro and in vivo evidence that ADAM8 on leukocytes holds a proinflammatory function in acute lung inflammation by promoting alveolar leukocyte recruitment.",1

A fourth group had access only to tap water (control group). The candidate gene ACSS2 was genotyped in human alcoholics by real-time polymerase chain reaction using the markers rs6088638 and rs7266550. Seven genes were picked out (Acss2, Acss3, Acat1, Acsl1, Acaa2, Hadh, and Hadhb) and the mRNA level of the Acss2 gene was increased only in the ""compulsive-like"" group (p = 0.004). The allele frequency of rs6088638 for the gene ACSS2 was higher in the Alcoholic human group (p = 0.03), although sample size was very small. The gene ACSS2 is associated with alcoholism, suggesting that biochemical pathways where it participates may have a role in the biological mechanisms susceptible to the ethanol effects.",1
28546218,"Extracellular matrix proteinases are implicated in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve disease. The ADAMTS5 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5) enzyme is secreted, matrix-associated metalloendopeptidase, capable of degrading extracellular matrix proteins, particularly matrilin 2. We sought to determine the role of the ADAMTS5/matrilin 2 axis in mediating the phenotype transition of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) associated with calcific aortic valve disease.",1
28545339,"ACO2 encodes aconitase 2, catalyzing the second step of the tricarboxylic acid. To date, there are only 6 reported families with 5 unique ACO2 mutations. Affected individuals can develop intellectual disability, epilepsy, brain atrophy, hypotonia, ataxia, optic atrophy, and retinal degeneration. Here, we report an 18-year-old boy with a novel ACO2 variant discovered on whole-exome sequencing. He presented with childhood-onset ataxia, impaired self-help skills comparable to severe-profound intellectual disability, intractable epilepsy, cerebellar atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, optic atrophy, and pigmentary retinopathy. His variant is the sixth unique ACO2 mutation. In addition, compared to mild cases (isolated optic atrophy) and severe cases (infantile death), our patient may be moderately affected, evident by increased survival and some preserved cognition (ability to speak full sentences and follow commands), which is a novel presentation. This case expands the disease spectrum to include increased survival with partly spared cognition.",1

Objectives of this study were 1) to investigate the frequency of this ACSS2 variant in Honduran unrelated NSCLP patients and unrelated unaffected controls and 2) to investigate the frequency of this variant in Colombian unrelated affected NSCLP patients and unrelated unaffected controls.",1
28540843,"In 2009, the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) for major depressive disorder (MDD) highlighted an association with PCLO locus on chromosome 7, although not reaching genome-wide significance level. In the present study, we revisited the original GWAS after increasing the overall sample size and the number of interrogated SNPs. In an analysis comparing 1,942 cases with lifetime diagnosis of MDD and 4,565 controls, PCLO showed a genome-wide significant association with MDD at SNP (rs2715157, p = 2.91 × 10-8) and gene-based (p = 1.48 × 10-7) level. Our results confirm the potential role of the PCLO gene in MDD, which is worth further replication and functional studies.",1
28540701,"Inverse PCR is a powerful tool for the rapid introduction of desired mutations at desired positions in a circular double-stranded DNA sequence. Here, custom-designed mutant primers oriented in the inverse direction are used to amplify the entire circular template with incorporation of the required mutation(s). By careful primer design it can be used to perform such diverse modifications as the introduction of point mutations and multiple mutations, the insertion of new sequences, and even sequence deletions. Three primer formats are commonly used; nonoverlapping, partially overlapping and fully overlapping primers, and here we describe the use of nonoverlapping primers for introduction of a point mutation. Use of such a primer setup in the PCR reaction, with one of the primers containing the desired mismatch mutation, results in the amplification of a linear, double-stranded, mutated product. Methylated template DNA is removed from the nonmethylated PCR product by DpnI digestion and the PCR product is then phosphorylated by polynucleotide kinase treatment before being recircularized by ligation, and transformed to E. coli. This relatively simple site-directed mutagenesis procedure is of major importance in biology and biotechnology today where it is commonly employed for the study and engineering of DNA, RNA, and proteins.",0
28540485,"Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C plays an important role in the human repair system. As reported in previous studies its polymorphism are associated with lung cancer susceptibility. The purpose of this study is to investigate the association of XPC gene with lung cancer susceptibility, overall response and clinical outcomes amongst North Indians. A hospital based study of 370 lung cancer cases and 370 healthy controls was conducted and genotypes were determined using PCR-RFLP assay. Results were assessed using logistic linear regression adjusted for age, sex and smoking status. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analysis. The treatment outcomes of 167 lung cancer patients treated with platinum based chemotherapy were evaluated.The mutant genotypic variant of XPC Lys<sup>939</sup>Gln has been associated with elevated risk of lung cancer(OR:2.30;95%CI:1.41-3.73;p=0.0007) whereas XPC Ala<sup>499</sup>Val showed a highly protective effect (OR:0.25;95%CI:0.10-0.63;p=0.003). The mutant genotype of XPC Lys<sup>939</sup>Gln presented a higher risk of developing lung cancer in heavy smokers (OR: 3.71; 95%CI:1.46-9.45; p=0.005). The survival analysis presented that heterozygous genotype showed least survival in comparison with mutant genotype in XPC Ala<sup>499</sup>Val genetic variant whereas no significant association was observed in XPC Lys<sup>939</sup>Gln.

28539379,"<b>Background:</b> Nutrition training for health care staff has been prioritized internationally as a key means of tackling malnutrition; however, there is a lack of clear evidence to support its implementation. Systematic reviews in other fields of training for health care staff indicate that training strategies may have a beneficial impact on learner and patient outcomes.<b>Objectives:</b> We assessed whether nutrition training for health care staff caring for nutritionally vulnerable adults resulted in improved learner and patient outcomes and evaluated the effectiveness of different training strategies.<b>Design:</b> A systematic review of trials of nutrition training for health care staff was conducted. Six databases were searched with key terms relating to malnutrition and nutrition training. Studies were categorized according to cognitive (didactic teaching), behavioral (practical implementation of skills), and psychological (individualized or group feedback and reflection) training strategies. Where sufficient data were available, meta-analysis was performed according to study design and training strategy. All study designs were eligible. The risk of bias was evaluated in accordance with Cochrane guidance.<b>Results:</b> Twenty-four studies met the eligibility criteria: 1 randomized controlled trial, 4 nonrandomized controlled trials, 3 quasi-experimental trials, 13 longitudinal pre-post trials, 2 qualitative studies, and 1 cross-sectional survey. Results from a number of low-quality studies suggest that nutrition training for health care staff may have a beneficial effect on staff nutrition knowledge, practice, and attitude as well as patient nutritional intake. There were insufficient data to determine whether any particular training strategy was more effective than the others.<b>Conclusions:</b> In the absence of high-quality evidence, low-quality studies suggest that nutrition training for health care staff has some positive effects. However, further randomized controlled trials are required to confirm overall efficacy and to explore the impact of training strategies on learner and patient outcomes.",0
28533408,"Like many complex human diseases, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is known to cluster in families. Familial ESCC cases often show early onset and worse prognosis than the sporadic cases. However, the molecular genetic basis underlying the development of familial ESCC is mostly unknown. We reported that <i>SLC22A3</i> is significantly down-regulated in nontumor esophageal tissues from patients with familial ESCC compared with tissues from patients with sporadic ESCCs. A-to-I RNA editing of the <i>SLC22A3</i> gene results in its reduced expression in the nontumor esophageal tissues of familial ESCCs and is significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis. The RNA-editing enzyme <i>ADAR2</i>, a familial ESCC susceptibility gene identified by our post hoc genome-wide association study, is positively correlated with the editing level of <i>SLC22A3</i> Moreover, functional studies showed that <i>SLC22A3</i> is a metastasis suppressor in ESCC, and deregulation of <i>SLC22A3</i> facilitates cell invasion and filopodia formation by reducing its direct association with α-actinin-4 (ACTN4), leading to the increased actin-binding activity of ACTN4 in normal esophageal cells. Collectively, we now show that A-to-I RNA editing of <i>SLC22A3</i> contributes to the early development and progression of familial esophageal cancer in high-risk individuals.",1
28528167,"Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A is a hereditary disease characterized by early onset of skin cancers and freckle-like pigmented maculae in sun-exposed sites. Although the etiology of the predisposition to UVR-induced skin tumors in xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A is well investigated as a repair deficiency in UVR-induced DNA damage, the mechanism of exaggerated sunburn in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A and whether UVR-induced inflammation relates to a skin tumor-prone phenotype remains to be elucidated. Using gene profiling of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A model mice, Xpa-deficient mice, we found that expression of CXCL1 in the skin and blood of Xpa-deficient mice increased significantly after UVB exposure over even a limited area compared with that of wild-type mice. We administered CXCL1 neutralizing antibody or the antioxidant agent, N-acetylcysteine, to Xpa-deficient mice after UVB irradiation and found significant suppression of blood levels of CXCL1, ear swelling and erythema, the hallmarks of inflammation and neutrophil chemotaxis. Xpa-deficient mice treated with chronic UVB exposure plus administration of CXCL1 neutralizing antibody or N-acetylcysteine yielded many fewer skin tumors compared with the control group. This indicates that the UVB-induced strong inflammatory response of Xpa-deficient mice plays a role in skin tumor development, which could be suppressed by regulating chemokines such as CXCL1.",1
28518146,"Acyl-CoA thioesterase 7 (ACOT7) is a major isoform of the ACOT family that catalyzes hydrolysis of fatty acyl-CoAs to free fatty acids and CoA-SH. However, canonical and non-canonical functions of ACOT7 remain to be discovered. In this study, for the first time, ACOT7 was shown to be responsive to genotoxic stresses such as ionizing radiation (IR) and the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin in time- and dose-dependent manners. ACOT7 knockdown induced cytostasis via activation of the p53-p21 signaling pathway without a DNA damage response. PKCζ was specifically involved in ACOT7 depletion-mediated cell cycle arrest as an upstream molecule of the p53-p21 signaling pathway in MCF7 human breast carcinoma and A549 human lung carcinoma cells. Of the other members of the ACOT family, including ACOT1, 4, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13 that were expressed in human, ACOT4, 8, and 12 were responsive to genotoxic stresses. However, none of those had a role in cytostasis via activation of the PKCζ-p53-p21 signaling pathway. Analysis of the ACOT7 prognostic value revealed that low ACOT7 levels prolonged overall survival periods in breast and lung cancer patients. Furthermore, ACOT7 mRNA levels were higher in lung cancer patient tissues compared to normal tissues. We also observed a synergistic effect of ACOT7 depletion in combination with either IR or doxorubicin on cell proliferation in breast and lung cancer cells. Together, our data suggest that a low level of ACOT7 may be involved, at least in part, in the prevention of human breast and lung cancer development via regulation of cell cycle progression.",1
28515154,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disorder that is caused by a point mutation in the <i>LMNA</i> gene, resulting in production of a truncated farnesylated-prelamin A protein (progerin). We previously reported that XPA mislocalized to the progerin-induced DNA double-strand break (DSB) sites, blocking DSB repair, which led to DSB accumulation, DNA damage responses, and early replication arrest in HGPS. In this study, the XPA mislocalization to DSBs occurred at stalled or collapsed replication forks, concurrent with a significant loss of PCNA at the forks, whereas PCNA efficiently bound to progerin. This PCNA sequestration likely exposed ds-ssDNA junctions at replication forks for XPA binding. Depletion of XPA or progerin each significantly restored PCNA at replication forks. Our results suggest that although PCNA is much more competitive than XPA in binding replication forks, PCNA sequestration by progerin may shift the equilibrium to favor XPA binding. Furthermore, we demonstrated that progerin-induced apoptosis could be rescued by XPA, suggesting that XPA-replication fork binding may prevent apoptosis in HGPS cells. Our results propose a mechanism for progerin-induced genome instability and accelerated replicative senescence in HGPS.-Hilton, B. A., Liu, J., Cartwright, B. M., Liu, Y., Breitman, M., Wang, Y., Jones, R., Tang, H., Rusinol, A., Musich, P. R., Zou, Y.

28486967,"Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a genetic metabolic disease with autosomal recessive inheritance caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene. The lack of functional ABCC6 protein leads to ectopic mineralization that is most apparent in the elastic tissues of the skin, eyes and blood vessels. The clinical prevalence of PXE has been estimated at between 1 per 100,000 and 1 per 25,000, with slight female predominance. The first clinical sign of PXE is almost always small yellow papules on the nape and sides of the neck and in flexural areas. The papules coalesce, and the skin becomes loose and wrinkled. The mid-dermal elastic fibers are short, fragmented, clumped and calcified. Dystrophic calcification of Bruch's membrane, revealed by angioid streaks, may trigger choroidal neovascularization and, ultimately, loss of central vision and blindness in late-stage disease. Lesions in small and medium-sized artery walls may result in intermittent claudication and peripheral artery disease. Cardiac complications (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris) are thought to be relatively rare but merit thorough investigation. Ischemic strokes have been reported. PXE is a metabolic disease in which circulating levels of an anti-mineralization factor are low. There is good evidence to suggest that the factor is inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), and that the circulating low levels of PPi and decreased PPi/Pi ratio result from the lack of ATP release by hepatocytes harboring the mutant ABCC6 protein. However, the substrate(s) bound, transported or modulated by the ABCC6 protein remain unknown. More than 300 sequence variants of the ABCC6 gene have been identified. There is no cure for PXE; the main symptomatic treatments are vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor therapy (for ophthalmic manifestations), lifestyle, lipid-lowering and dietary measures (for reducing vascular risk factors), and vascular surgery (for severe cardiovascular manifestations). Future treatment options may include gene therapy/editing and pharmacologic chaperone therapy.",1
28481660,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is caused by the loss of function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) combined with hyperactivation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). In the lung, ENaC is responsible for movement of sodium. Hyperactivation of ENaC, which creates an osmotic gradient that pulls fluid out of the airway, contributes to reduced airway hydration, causing mucus dehydration, decreased mucociliary clearance, and recurrent acute bacterial infections. ENaC represents a therapeutic target to treat all patients with CF independent of their underlying CFTR mutation.",1
28475762,"Epigenetic regulation of immune cell types could be critical for the development and maintenance of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). B cells are highly relevant in RA, since patients express autoantibodies and depleting this cell type is a successful therapeutic approach. Epigenetic variation, such as DNA methylation, may mediate the pathogenic activity of B cells. In this study, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) for RA with three different replication cohorts, to identify disease-specific alterations in DNA methylation in B cells. CpG methylation in isolated B lymphocytes was assayed on the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in a discovery cohort of RA patients (N = 50) and controls (N = 75). Differential methylation was observed in 64 CpG sites (q < 0.05). Six biological pathways were also differentially methylated in RA B cells. Analysis in an independent cohort of patients (N = 15) and controls (N = 15) validated the association of 10 CpG sites located on 8 genes CD1C, TNFSF10, PARVG, NID1, DHRS12, ITPK1, ACSF3 and TNFRSF13C, and 2 intergenic regions. Differential methylation at the CBL signaling pathway was replicated. Using an additional case-control cohort (N = 24), the association between RA risk and CpGs cg18972751 at CD1C (P = 2.26 × 10-9) and cg03055671 at TNFSF10 (P = 1.67 × 10-8) genes was further validated. Differential methylation at genes CD1C, TNFSF10, PARVG, NID1, DHRS12, ITPK1, ACSF3, TNFRSF13C and intergenic region chr10p12.31 was replicated in a cohort of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients (N = 47) and controls (N = 56). Our results highlight genes that may drive the pathogenic activity of B cells in RA and suggest shared methylation patterns with SLE.",1
28466543,"Blockade of immune checkpoints has become a powerful tool in cancer medicine, which is effective across various solid cancer types and hematologic malignancies. While immunohistochemical detection of PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, immune cells, or both has been introduced as predictive biomarker in several clinical trials, shortcomings and limitations of this approach were quickly recognized. As a single biomarker is unlikely to adequately reflect the complex interplay between immune cells and cancer, various genetic determinants of therapy success, including microsatellite instability, mutational burden, and PD-L1 amplification, are being investigated. Very recent work indicates that mutations in B2M, JAK1, and JAK2 render melanoma resistant to immune checkpoint blockade, thus serving as negative response predictors. Using the TCGA dataset, we performed a pan-cancer analysis of potentially damaging mutations in key genes implicated in antigen presentation and interferon-gamma signaling and investigated associations with transcript levels of immune checkpoint genes, cytolytic activity, and mutational burden. For B2M, JAK1, and JAK2, we observed overall mutation frequencies of 1.8%, 2%, and 2.6%, respectively, and found significant associations with mutational burden. On pathway level, melanoma as well as bladder, gastric, and lung cancer were most frequently affected by putative resistance mutations with mutation rates of 27%-50% in the antigen presentation pathway and of 16%-21% in the interferon signaling pathway. Our analysis suggests that a significant number of tumors harbor mutations that may negatively interfere with immune checkpoint inhibition, or confer a higher likelihood of resistance for which a second hit is ultimately required. Since these mutations are prevalent in treatment-naïve tumors, genetic screening prior to therapy might complement current approaches at predicting response to immune checkpoint blockade.",1
28461288,"Puerto Ricans are disproportionately affected with asthma in the USA. In this study, we aim to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to asthma in Puerto Ricans.We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of asthma in Puerto Ricans, including participants from: the Genetics of Asthma in Latino Americans (GALA) I-II, the Hartford-Puerto Rico Study and the Hispanic Community Health Study. Moreover, we examined whether susceptibility loci identified in previous meta-analyses of GWAS are associated with asthma in Puerto Ricans.The only locus to achieve genome-wide significance was chromosome 17q21, as evidenced by our top single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs907092 (OR 0.71, p=1.2×10<sup>-12</sup>) at <i>IKZF3</i> Similar to results in non-Puerto Ricans, SNPs in genes in the same linkage disequilibrium block as <i>IKZF3</i> (<i>e.g. ZPBP2</i>, <i>ORMDL3</i> and <i>GSDMB</i>) were significantly associated with asthma in Puerto Ricans. With regard to results from a meta-analysis in Europeans, we replicated findings for rs2305480 at <i>GSDMB</i>, but not for SNPs in any other genes. On the other hand, we replicated results from a meta-analysis of North American populations for SNPs at <i>IL1RL1</i>, <i>TSLP</i> and <i>GSDMB</i> but not for <i>IL33</i>Our findings suggest that common variants on chromosome 17q21 have the greatest effects on asthma in Puerto Ricans.",1
28449868,"Vitamin D is a potent immunomodulator capable of dampening inflammatory signals in several cell types involved in the asthmatic response. Its deficiency has been associated with increased inflammation, exacerbations, and overall poor outcomes in patients with asthma. Given the increase in the prevalence of asthma over the past few decades, there has been enormous interest in the use of vitamin D supplementation as a potential therapeutic option. Here, we critically reviewed the most recent findings from in vitro studies, animal models, and clinical trials regarding the role of vitamin D in treating bronchial asthma.",1
28441029,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is caused by a complex interaction of environmental exposures, most commonly cigarette smoke, and genetic factors. Chronic cigarette smoke exposure in the mouse is a commonly used animal model of COPD. We aimed to expand our knowledge about the variable susceptibility of inbred strains to this model and test for genetic variants associated with this trait. To that end, we sought to measure differential susceptibility to cigarette smoke-induced emphysema in the mouse, identify genetic loci associated with this quantitative trait, and find homologous human genes associated with COPD. Alveolar chord length (CL) in 34 inbred strains of mice was measured after 6 months of exposure to cigarette smoke. After testing for association, we connected a murine candidate locus to a published meta-analysis of moderate-to-severe COPD. We identified deleterious mutations in a candidate gene in silico and measured gene expression in extreme strains. A/J was the most susceptible strain in our survey (Δ CL 7.0 ± 2.2 μm) and CBA/J was the least susceptible (Δ CL -0.3 ± 1.2 μm). By integrating mouse and human genome-wide scans, we identified the candidate gene Abi3bp. CBA/J mice harbor predicted deleterious variants in Abi3bp, and expression of the gene differs significantly between CBA/J and A/J mice. This is the first report of susceptibility to cigarette smoke-induced emphysema in 34 inbred strains of mice, and Abi3bp is identified as a potential contributor to this phenotype.",1
28438353,"Vitamin D is a fascinating and attractive molecule that has gained particular attention in medicine in recent years. Its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory potential might resemble the activity of many nature-derived molecules (eg, flavonoids), but its role in biology was selected during a long evolutionary pathway to dampen the damaging effect of cell stress response and of the immune reaction. In this sense, this molecule can be considered an ancient hormone that serves, in its primary role, as a pro-survival agent. The goal of this review was to elucidate this topic.",0
28431734,"To investigate gender stereotypes, demonstrated engineering aptitude, and attitudes, children (N=105) solved an engineering problem using either pastel-colored or primary-colored materials. Participants also evaluated the acceptability of denial of access to engineering materials based on gender and counter-stereotypic preferences (i.e., a boy who prefers pastel-colored materials). Whereas material color was not related to differences in female participants' performance, younger boys assigned to pastel materials demonstrated lower engineering aptitude than did other participants. In addition, results documented age- and gender-related differences; younger participants, and sometimes boys, exhibited less flexibility regarding gender stereotypes than did older and female participants. The findings suggest that attempts to enhance STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) engagement or performance through the color of STEM materials may have unintended consequences.",0

28413960,"Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a homologue of ACE that catalyzes the conversion of Angiotensin (Ang) II into Ang1-7, which induces vasodilation, anti-fibrotic, anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects. Given that ACE2 counterbalances the effects of Ang II, it has been proposed as a biomarker in kidney disease patients. Circulating ACE2 has been studied in human and experimental studies under physiological and pathological conditions and different techniques have been assessed to determine its enzymatic activity. In patients with cardiovascular (CV) disease circulating ACE2 has been shown to be increased. In addition, hypertensive and diabetic patients have also shown higher circulating ACE2 activities. A study in type 1 diabetes patients found a negative association between circulating ACE2 and estimated glomerular filtration rate in male and female patients. Recently, it has been demonstrated that circulating ACE2 is increased in male patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and that it is independently associated with other classical CV risk factors, such as advanced age and diabetes. Furthermore, circulating ACE2 has been shown to be associated with silent atherosclerosis and CV outcomes in CKD patients. In diabetic nephropathy, experimental studies have demonstrated an increase in circulating ACE2 activity both at early and late stages of the disease, as well as a direct association with increased urinary albumin excretion, suggesting that it may be increased as a renoprotective mechanism in these patients. In this paper we will review the measurement of circulating ACE2 and its role in kidney disease, as well as its potential role as a renal and CV biomarker.",1
28409746,"As a member of the A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase (ADAM) family, ADAM10 has been identified as the constitutive α-secretase in the process of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) cleavage and plays a critical role in reducing the generation of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. Recent studies have demonstrated its beneficial role in alleviating the pathologic impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) both in vitro and in vivo. However, the role of ADAM10 in AD and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still not well established. Increasing evidence indicates that ADAM10 not only reduces the generation of Aβ but may also affect the pathology of AD through potential mechanisms including reducing tau pathology, maintaining normal synaptic functions, and promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and the homeostasis of neuronal networks. Mechanistically, ADAM10 regulates these functions by interacting with postsynaptic substrates in brain, especially synaptic cell receptors and adhesion molecules. Furthermore, ADAM10 protein in platelets seems to be a promising biomarker for AD diagnosis. This review will summarize the role of ADAM10 in AD and highlight its functions besides its role as the α-secretase in AβPP cleavage. Meanwhile, we will discuss the therapeutic potential of ADAM10 in treating AD.",1
28397838,"Approximately 1% of the global population is affected by intellectual disability (ID), and the majority receive no molecular diagnosis. Previous studies have indicated high levels of genetic heterogeneity, with estimates of more than 2500 autosomal ID genes, the majority of which are autosomal recessive (AR). Here, we combined microarray genotyping, homozygosity-by-descent (HBD) mapping, copy number variation (CNV) analysis, and whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify disease genes/mutations in 192 multiplex Pakistani and Iranian consanguineous families with non-syndromic ID. We identified definite or candidate mutations (or CNVs) in 51% of families in 72 different genes, including 26 not previously reported for ARID. The new ARID genes include nine with loss-of-function mutations (ABI2, MAPK8, MPDZ, PIDD1, SLAIN1, TBC1D23, TRAPPC6B, UBA7 and USP44), and missense mutations include the first reports of variants in BDNF or TET1 associated with ID. The genes identified also showed overlap with de novo gene sets for other neuropsychiatric disorders. Transcriptional studies showed prominent expression in the prenatal brain. The high yield of AR mutations for ID indicated that this approach has excellent clinical potential and should inform clinical diagnostics, including clinical whole exome and genome sequencing, for populations in which consanguinity is common. As with other AR disorders, the relevance will also apply to outbred populations.",1
28385530,"Metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a mostly incurable disease. The fact that the identity of the mechanisms that regulate metastasis in HCC is known hampers the development of anti-metastatic therapies. Currently, there is no effective treatment for HCC once it is progressed to metastatic stage. Therefore, further study to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the metastasis of HCC is urgently required for the improvement of HCC treatment. Here, we describes actin gamma smooth muscle 2 (ACTG2) over-express in HCC and demonstrates high-expression of ACTG2 as a promising therapeutic target in HCC metastasis. The use of shRNA to knock-down ACTG2 impaired cells migration and invasion in vitro. Moreover, silencing of ACTG2 causes almost complete inhibition of metastasis in vivo. In contrast, overexpression ACTG2 significantly enforces HCC cells migration and metastasis. Finally, ACTG2 boosts the metastatic potential of HCC cells in a Notch homolog 1 (Notch1) dependent manner. Collectively, our study reveals a critical role of ACTG2 in HCC tumor metastasis, and renders it a novel target for the treatment of HCC.",1
28383515,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporters may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic vascular diseases due to their involvement in cholesterol homeostasis, blood pressure regulation, endothelial function, vascular inflammation, as well as platelet production and aggregation. In this regard, ABC transporters, such as ABCA1, ABCG5 and ABCG8, were initially found to be responsible for genetically-inherited syndromes like Tangier diseases and sitosterolemia. These findings led to the understanding of those transporter's function in cellular cholesterol efflux and thereby also linked them to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Subsequently, further ABC transporters, i.e., ABCG1, ABCG4, ABCB6, ABCC1, ABCC6 or ABCC9, have been shown to directly or indirectly affect cellular cholesterol efflux, the inflammatory response in macrophages, megakaryocyte proliferation and thrombus formation, as well as vascular function and blood pressure, and may thereby contribute to the pathogenesis of CVD and its complications. Furthermore, ABC transporters, such as ABCB1, ABCC2 or ABCG2, may affect the safety and efficacy of several drug classes currently in use for CVD treatment. This review will give a brief overview of ABC transporters involved in the process of atherogenesis and CVD pathology. It also aims to briefly summarize the role of ABC transporters in the pharmacokinetics and disposition of drugs frequently used to treat CVD and CVD-related complications.",1
28373586,"ADAMTS2 (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase With Thrombospondin Motifs 2) is recognized as a metalloproteinase that promotes the cleavage of amino propeptides of types I, II, III, and V procollagens. However, the role of ADAMTS2 in the heart has not yet been defined. Herein, we observed the upregulated expression of ADAMTS2 in failing human hearts and hypertrophic murine hearts. Mice lacking ADAMTS2 display exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy on pressure overload-induced hypertrophic response, whereas mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of ADAMTS2 display alleviation of this detrimental phenotype. Consistent with these results, in vitro loss or gain of function experiments in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes confirmed that ADAMTS2 negatively regulates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in response to Ang II. Mechanistically, blockage of the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT (protein kinase B)-dependent signaling pathway with specific inhibitors both in vivo and in vitro could rescue the aggravated hypertrophic response to the loss of ADAMTS2. Collectively, we propose that ADAMTS2 regulates the hypertrophic response through inhibiting the activation of the PI3K/AKT-dependent signaling pathway. Because ADAMTS2 is an extracellular protein, it could be effectively manipulated using pharmacological means to modulate cardiac hypertrophy.",1

Previously, we have shown that WNT target genes AXIN2, DKK1, APCDD1, ASCL2 and LGR5 are silenced by DNA methylation and could serve as prognostic markers in stage II CC patients using methylation-specific PCR. Here, we have extended our discovery cohort AMC90-AJCC-II (N=65) and methylation was analyzed by quantitative pyrosequencing. Subsequently, we validated the results in an independent EPICOLON1 CC cohort (N=79). Methylation of WNT target genes is negatively correlated to mRNA expression. A combination of AXIN2 and DKK1 methylation significantly predicted recurrences in univariate (area under the curve (AUC)=0.83, confidence interval (CI): 0.72-0.94, P<0.0001) analysis in stage II microsatellite stable (MSS) CC patients. This two marker combination showed an AUC of 0.80 (CI: 0.68-0.91, P<0.0001) in the EPICOLON1 validation cohort. Multivariate analysis in the Academic Medical Center (AMC) cohort revealed that both WNT target gene methylation and consensus molecular subtype 4 (CMS4) are significantly associated with poor recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio (HR)<sub>methylation</sub>: 3.84, 95% CI: 1.14-12.43; HR<sub>CMS4</sub>: 3.73, 95% CI: 1.22-11.48). CMS4 subtype tumors with WNT target methylation showed worse prognosis. Combining WNT target gene methylation and CMS4 subtype lead to an AUC of 0.89 (0.791-0.982, P<0.0001) for recurrence prediction. Notably, we observed that methylation of DKK1 is high in BRAF mutant and CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype)-positive cancers, whereas AXIN2 methylation appears to be associated with CMS4. Methylation of AXIN2 and DKK1 were found to be robust markers for recurrence prediction in stage II MSS CC patients. Further validation of these findings in a randomized and prospective manner could pave a way to identify poor prognosis patients of stage II CC for AT.",1
28362817,"Breast cancer is the most common solid organ malignancy and the most frequent cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Previous research has yielded insights into its genetic etiology, but there remains a gap in the understanding of genetic factors that contribute to risk, and particularly in the biological mechanisms by which genetic variation modulates risk. The National Cancer Institute's ""Up for a Challenge"" (U4C) competition provided an opportunity to further elucidate the genetic basis of the disease. Our group leveraged the seven datasets made available by the U4C organizers and data from the publicly available UK Biobank cohort to examine associations between imputed gene expression and breast cancer risk. In particular, we used reference datasets describing the breast tissue and whole blood transcriptomes to impute expression levels in breast cancer cases and controls. In trans-ethnic meta-analyses of U4C and UK Biobank data, we found significant associations between breast cancer risk and the expression of RCCD1 (joint p-value: 3.6x10-06) and DHODH (p-value: 7.1x10-06) in breast tissue, as well as a suggestive association for ANKLE1 (p-value: 9.3x10-05). Expression of RCCD1 in whole blood was also suggestively associated with disease risk (p-value: 1.2x10-05), as were expression of ACAP1 (p-value: 1.9x10-05) and LRRC25 (p-value: 5.2x10-05). While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated RCCD1 and ANKLE1 in breast cancer risk, they have not identified the remaining three genes. Among the genetic variants that contributed to the predicted expression of the five genes, we found 23 nominally (p-value < 0.05) associated with breast cancer risk, among which 15 are not in high linkage disequilibrium with risk variants previously identified by GWAS. In summary, we used a transcriptome-based approach to investigate the genetic underpinnings of breast carcinogenesis. This approach provided an avenue for deciphering the functional relevance of genes and genetic variants involved in breast cancer.",1
28322462,"Signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) exhibits tumor-suppressor properties by inhibiting oncogenic pathways and promoting tumor immunosurveillance. MicroRNAs, a group of non-coding endogenous ones, may regulate gene expression and plays specific roles in tumorigenesis. Recently, miR-181a has been reported to be associated with poor prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Using human colorectal cancer cell lines, we demonstrated that STAT1 suppresses both LoVo and SW480 cell growth by down-regulating miR-181a. STAT1 regulates the expression of miR-181a through binding to the elements in the miR-181a's promoter region. Further, we revealed that miR-181a accelerates CRC cell proliferation through phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome ten (PTEN). In addition, PTEN protein was upregulated in response to STAT1 overexpression or miR-181a inhibition, downregulated in response to STAT1 knockdown or miR-181a overexpression. Without changes on the AKT protein level, p-AKT was downregulated by STAT1 overexpression or miR-181a inhibition while upregulated by STAT1 knockdown or miR-181a overexpression, indicating PTEN/Akt pathway activated in STAT1/miR-181a regulation of CRC cell proliferation. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the STAT1/miR-181a/PTEN pathway in colorectal cancer and add new insight regarding the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer. J. Cell.

28297667,"RNA modifications play critical roles in important biological processes. However, the functions of N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) mRNA modification in cancer biology and cancer stem cells remain largely unknown. Here, we show that m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA modification is critical for glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) self-renewal and tumorigenesis. Knockdown of METTL3 or METTL14, key components of the RNA methyltransferase complex, dramatically promotes human GSC growth, self-renewal, and tumorigenesis. In contrast, overexpression of METTL3 or inhibition of the RNA demethylase FTO suppresses GSC growth and self-renewal. Moreover, inhibition of FTO suppresses tumor progression and prolongs lifespan of GSC-grafted mice substantially. m<sup>6</sup>A sequencing reveals that knockdown of METTL3 or METTL14 induced changes in mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A enrichment and altered mRNA expression of genes (e.g., ADAM19) with critical biological functions in GSCs. In summary, this study identifies the m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA methylation machinery as promising therapeutic targets for glioblastoma.",1
28297624,"In recent years, our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of myeloid neoplasms, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), has been greatly advanced by genomics discovery studies that use novel high-throughput sequencing techniques. AML, similar to most other cancers, is characterized by multiple somatically acquired mutations that affect genes of different functional categories, a complex clonal architecture, and disease evolution over time. Patterns of mutations seem to follow specific and temporally ordered trajectories. Mutations in genes encoding epigenetic modifiers, such as DNMT3A, ASXL1, TET2, IDH1, and IDH2, are commonly acquired early and are present in the founding clone. The same genes are frequently found to be mutated in elderly individuals along with clonal expansion of hematopoiesis that confers an increased risk for the development of hematologic cancers. Furthermore, such mutations may persist after therapy, lead to clonal expansion during hematologic remission, and eventually lead to relapsed disease. In contrast, mutations involving NPM1 or signaling molecules (eg, FLT3, RAS) typically are secondary events that occur later during leukemogenesis. Genetic data are now being used to inform disease classification, risk stratification, and clinical care of patients. Two new provisional entities, AML with mutated RUNX1 and AML with BCR- ABL1, have been included in the current update of the WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms and AML, and mutations in three genes- RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53-have been added in the risk stratification of the 2017 European LeukemiaNet recommendations for AML. Integrated evaluation of baseline genetics and assessment of minimal residual disease are expected to further improve risk stratification and selection of postremission therapy. Finally, the identification of disease alleles will guide the development and use of novel molecularly targeted therapies.",1
28283841,"Glycogen storage disease (GSD) type IX is a rare disease of variable clinical severity affecting primarily the liver tissue. Individuals with liver phosphorylase b kinase (PhK) deficiency (GSD IX) can present with hepatomegaly with elevated serum transaminases, ketotic hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and poor growth with considerable variation in clinical severity. PhK is a cAMP-dependent protein kinase that phosphorylates the inactive form of glycogen phosphorylase, phosphorylase b, to produce the active form, phosphorylase a. PhK is a heterotetramer; the alpha 2 subunit in the liver is encoded by the X-linked PHKA2 gene. About 75% of individuals with liver PhK deficiency have mutations in the PHKA2 gene; this condition is also known as X-linked glycogenosis (XLG). Here we report the variability in clinical severity and laboratory findings in 12 male patients from 10 different families with X-linked liver PhK deficiency caused by mutations in PHKA2. We found that there is variability in the severity of clinical features, including hypoglycemia and growth. We also report additional PHKA2 variants that were identified in 24 patients suspected to have liver PhK deficiency. The basis of the clinical variation in GSDIX due to X-linked PHKA2 gene mutations is currently not well understood. Creating systematic registries, and collecting longitudinal data may help in better understanding of this rare, but common, glycogen storage disorder.",1
28282546,"The A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase (ADAM) family of endopeptidases plays a role in many solid cancers and includes promising targets for anticancer therapies. Deregulation of ADAM15 has been linked to tumor aggressiveness and cell line studies suggest that ADAM15 overexpression may also be implicated in prostate cancer. To evaluate the impact of ADAM15 expression and its relationship with key genomic alterations, a tissue microarray containing 12,427 prostate cancers was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. ADAM15 expression was compared to phenotype, prognosis and molecular features including TMPRSS2:ERG fusion and frequent deletions involving PTEN, 3p, 5q and 6q. Normal prostate epithelium did not show ADAM15 staining. In prostate cancers, negative, weak, moderate, and strong ADAM15 staining was found in 87.7%, 3.7%, 5.6%, and 3.0% of 9826 interpretable tumors. Strong ADAM15 staining was linked to high Gleason grade, advanced pathological tumor stage, positive nodal stage and resection margin. ADAM15 overexpression was also associated with TMPRSS2:ERG fusions and PTEN deletions (P<.0001) but unrelated to deletions of 3p, 5q and 6q. In univariate analysis, high ADAM15 expression was strongly linked to PSA recurrence (P<.0001). However, in multivariate analyses this association was only maintained if the analysis was limited to preoperatively available parameters in ERG-negative cancers. The results of our study demonstrate that ADAM15 is strongly up regulated in a small but highly aggressive fraction of prostate cancers. In these tumors, ADAM15 may represent a suitable drug target. In a preoperative scenario, ADAM15 expression measurement may assist prognosis assessment, either alone or in combination with other markers.",1
28279749,"Acute appendicitis is the most common condition that presents with an acute abdomen needing emergency surgery. Despite this common presentation, correctly diagnosing appendicitis remains a challenge as clinical signs or positive blood results can be absent in 55% of the patients. The reported proportion of missed diagnoses of appendicitis ranges between 20% and 40%. A delay or mis-diagnosis of appendicitis can result in severe complications such as perforation, abscess formation, sepsis, and intra-abdominal adhesions. Literature has shown that patients who had a negative appendectomy suffer post-op complications and infections secondary to hospital stays; there have even been reported cases of fatality. It is therefore crucial that timely and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis is achieved to avoid complications of both non-operating as well as unnecessary surgical intervention. The aim of this review is to systematically report and analyse the latest evidence on the different approaches used in diagnosing appendicitis. We include discussions of clinical scoring systems, laboratory tests, latest innovative bio-markers and radiological imaging.",0
28278534,"TDP-43 (<i>T</i>AR <i>D</i>NA binding <i>P</i>rotein of <i>43</i> kD) is a transcription factor and RNA-binding protein with diverse functions. We cloned TDP-43 from the mouse testis in a screen for promoter-binding proteins and showed that it functions as a transcriptional repressor. TDP-43 plays a role in maintaining the precise pattern of spatiotemporal expression of the spermatid-specific <i>Acrv1</i> gene during spermatogenesis by facilitating RNA polymerase II pausing at the promoter. We also showed that TDP-43 plays a partial role in preventing somatic cell expression of the <i>Acrv1</i> gene by acting as an insulator-binding protein. Since the discovery of a causative link to several neurodegenerative diseases 10 years ago, TDP-43 has emerged as a protein of major human health relevance. Aberrant posttranslational modifications, nuclear exit, and cytoplasmic aggregate formation contribute to loss of neuronal function in patients. Interestingly, aberrant TDP-43 expression has also been reported in the testis and sperm of infertile men. Finally, our unpublished work shows that TDP-43 is indispensable for sperm formation and male fertility. The potential role of TDP-43 in male germ cells and fertility is discussed in this review.",1
28265178,"Obesity is one of the most prevalent metabolic diseases in the Western world and correlates directly with insulin resistance, which may ultimately culminate in type 2 diabetes (T2D). We sought to ascertain whether the human metalloproteinase A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 19 (ADAM19) correlates with parameters of the metabolic syndrome in humans and mice. To determine the potential novel role of ADAM19 in the metabolic syndrome, we first conducted microarray studies on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a well-characterised human cohort. Secondly, we examined the expression of ADAM19 in liver and gonadal white adipose tissue using an in vivo diet induced obesity mouse model. Finally, we investigated the effect of neutralising ADAM19 on diet induced weight gain, insulin resistance in vivo, and liver TNF-<i>α</i> levels. Significantly, we show that, in humans, ADAM19 strongly correlates with parameters of the metabolic syndrome, particularly BMI, relative fat, HOMA-IR, and triglycerides. Furthermore, we identified that ADAM19 expression was markedly increased in the liver and gonadal white adipose tissue of obese and T2D mice. Excitingly, we demonstrate in our diet induced obesity mouse model that neutralising ADAM19 therapy results in weight loss, improves insulin sensitivity, and reduces liver TNF-<i>α</i> levels. Our novel data suggest that ADAM19 is pro-obesogenic and enhances insulin resistance. Therefore, neutralisation of ADAM19 may be a potential therapeutic approach to treat obesity and T2D.",1

28260090,"Osteosarcoma harbors highly metastatic properties, accounting for postoperative recurrence and metastasis. Actin-like protein 6A (ACTL6A) regulates cell proliferation, migration and differentiation. However, the biologic role of ACTL6A in osteosarcoma remains unknown. In this study, the results showed that, by analysis of frozen fresh primary tumor tissues, matched non-cancerous bone tissues (NCBTs) and biopsy lung metastatic nodule tissues from 30 osteosarcoma patients after radical surgical resection, ACTL6A was overexpressed in osteosarcoma tissues compared with matched NCBTs, and its expression level was associated with osteosarcoma metastasis. Immunohistochemical analyses of osteosarcoma tissue samples from two independent cohorts of formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded osteosarcoma tissue samples from total of 186 osteosarcoma patients showed that high ACTL6A expression correlated with malignant clinicopathological features such as larger tumor size, high Ennecking grade, high histologic grade, and advanced tumor node metastasis stage. High ACTL6A expression was associated with poor prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma, and an independent and significant risk factor for disease-free survival and overall survival after radical tumor resection. Both in vitro and in vivo assays showed that ACTL6A overexpression promoted osteosarcoma cell invasion and metastasis, whereas knockdown of ACTL6A expression reduced osteosarcoma cell malignant behavior such as invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, we proved that ACTL6A promoted osteosarcoma cells of metastasis through facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In conclusion, data from the present study demonstrated that ACTL6A was associated with poor survival and promoted osteosarcoma cell metastasis through EMT, suggesting that ACTL6A may be a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for osteosarcoma.",1
28238542,"This study aims to deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We first downloaded a gene expression profile dataset GSE29721 (10 HCC and 10 control samples) from Gene Expression Omnibus database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by the paired t-test using limma package. Pathway and functional enrichment analyses were performed with DAVID tools. Transcription factors were annotated with TRANSFAC database and tumor associated genes (TAGs) were annotated with TAG and TSGene databases. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was conducted using STRING online tool and function module was further identified with BioNet package. Totally, 527 up-regulated DEGs and 587 down-regulated DEGs were identified. GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses showed that the up-regulated DEGs were mainly related to cell division and cell cycle, while the down-regulated DEGs were largely related to material metabolism, especially secondary metabolism. Proteins encoded by DEGs CDK1, BUB1, CDC20, NCAPG, NDC80, CDCA8, MAD2L1, CCNB1, CCNA2 and BIRC5 were hub genes with high degrees in the PPI network; further module analysis detected a subnetwork consisting of 55 proteins, such as CYP2B6, ACAA1, BHMT and ALDH2. Taken together, aberrant expression of cell cycle related genes (e.g., CDK1, CCNA2, CCNB1, BUB1, MAD2L1 and CDC20) and material metabolism related genes (e.g., CYP2B6, ACAA1, BHMT and ALDH2) may contribute to HCC occurrence.",1

28235093,"This paper presents the results of a consensus-driven process identifying 50 priority research questions for historical ecology obtained through crowdsourcing, literature reviews, and in-person workshopping. A deliberative approach was designed to maximize discussion and debate with defined outcomes. Two in-person workshops (in Sweden and Canada) over the course of two years and online discussions were peer facilitated to define specific key questions for historical ecology from anthropological and archaeological perspectives. The aim of this research is to showcase the variety of questions that reflect the broad scope for historical-ecological research trajectories across scientific disciplines. Historical ecology encompasses research concerned with decadal, centennial, and millennial human-environmental interactions, and the consequences that those relationships have in the formation of contemporary landscapes. Six interrelated themes arose from our consensus-building workshop model: (1) climate and environmental change and variability; (2) multi-scalar, multi-disciplinary; (3) biodiversity and community ecology; (4) resource and environmental management and governance; (5) methods and applications; and (6) communication and policy. The 50 questions represented by these themes highlight meaningful trends in historical ecology that distill the field down to three explicit findings. First, historical ecology is fundamentally an applied research program. Second, this program seeks to understand long-term human-environment interactions with a focus on avoiding, mitigating, and reversing adverse ecological effects. Third, historical ecology is part of convergent trends toward transdisciplinary research science, which erodes scientific boundaries between the cultural and natural.",0

28215448,"Despite a conceptual understanding that evolution and species interactions are inextricably linked, it remains challenging to study ecological and evolutionary dynamics together over long temporal scales. In this review, we argue that, despite inherent challenges associated with reconstructing historical processes, the interplay of ecology and evolution is central to our understanding of macroevolution and community coexistence, and cannot be safely ignored in community and comparative phylogenetic studies. We highlight new research avenues that foster greater consideration of both ecological and evolutionary dynamics as processes that occur along branches of phylogenetic trees. By promoting new ways forward using this perspective, we hope to inspire further integration that creatively co-utilizes phylogenies and ecological data to study eco-evolutionary dynamics over time and space.",0

28205525,"Experimental autoimmune epididymo-orchitis (EAEO) is a model of chronic inflammation, induced by immunisation with testicular antigens, which reproduces the pathology of some types of human infertility. Activins A and B regulate spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis, but are also pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic cytokines. Expression of the activins and their endogenous antagonists, inhibin and follistatin, was examined in murine EAEO. Adult untreated and adjuvant-treated control mice showed no pathology. All mice immunised with testis antigens developed EAEO by 50 days, characterised by loss of germ cells, immune cell infiltration and fibrosis in the testis, similar to biopsies from human inflamed testis. An increase of total CD45+ leukocytes, comprising CD3+ T cells, CD4 + CD8- and CD4 + CD25+ T cells, and a novel population of CD4 + CD8+ double positive T cells was also detected in EAEO testes. This was accompanied by increased expression of TNF, MCP-1 and IL-10. Activin A and B and follistatin protein levels were elevated in EAEO testes, with peak activin expression during the active phase of the disease, whereas mRNA expression of the inhibin B subunits (Inha and Inhbb) and activin receptor subunits (Acvr1b and Acvr2b) were downregulated. These data suggest that activin-follistatin regulation may play a role during the development of EAEO.",1

28199476,"The homeoprotein Six1 is overexpressed in many human cancers and is associated with increased tumor progression and metastasis. Recent studies have shown that Six1 is associated with poorer overall survival in advanced-stage colorectal cancer (CRC). In the current study, we explored the functional changes and molecular events associated with Six1 overexpression in a mouse model of CRC. An orthotopic model and a splenic injection metastasis model were used to investigate the role of Six1 in CRC tumor growth and metastasis using mouse colon adenocarcinoma MC38 cells overexpressing Six1. We found that overexpression of Six1 dramatically promotes CRC tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Six1 overexpression in MC38 increased protein levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 and expanded CD44+/CD166+ populations, indicating Six1 increased features of cancer stem cells. In addition, Six1 overexpression stimulated angiogenesis by upregulating the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Six1-overexpressing tumor cells recruited tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) by increasing the expression of macrophage-specific colony stimulating factor, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2/5 and VEGF, further facilitating CRC tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, we determined that Six1 activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in CRC cells. In summary, our studies strongly suggest that Six1 overexpression promotes CRC growth and metastasis and remodels tumor stroma by stimulating angiogenesis and recruiting TAM. MAPK activation may be a pivotal event in Six1-associated tumor progression, which may provide opportunities for pharmacologic intervention.",1

28179590,"Although gene-to-gene analyses identified genetic alterations such as APC, KRAS and TP53 mutations in colon adenomas, it is largely unknown whether there are any others in them. Mutational profiling of high-grade colon adenoma (HGCA) that just precedes colon carcinoma might identify not only novel adenoma-specific genes but also critical genes for its progression to carcinoma. For this, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 12 HGCAs and identified 11 non-hypermutated and one hypermutated (POLE-mutated) cases. We identified 22 genes including APC, KRAS, TP53, GNAS, NRAS, SMAD4, ARID2, and PIK3CA with non-silent mutations in the cancer Census Genes. Bi-allelic and mono-allelic APC alterations were found in nine and one HGCAs, respectively, while the other two harbored wild-type APC. Five HGCAs harbored either mono-allelic (four HGCAs) or bi-allelic (one HGCA) SMAD4 mutation or 18q loss that had been known as early carcinoma-specific changes. We identified MTOR, ACVR1B, GNAQ, ATM, CNOT1, EP300, ARID2, RET and MAP2K4 mutations for the first time in colon adenomas. Our WES data is largely matched with the earlier 'adenoma-carcinoma model' (APC, KRAS, NRAS and GNAS mutations), but there are newly identified SMAD4, MTOR, ACVR1B, GNAQ, ATM, CNOT1, EP300, ARID2, RET and MAP2K4 mutations in this study. Our findings provide resource for understanding colon premalignant lesions and for identifying genomic clues for differential diagnosis and therapy options for colon adenomas and carcinomas.",1
28178326,"Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) is a gut-derived peptide hormone that is produced following activation of Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR). FGF19 is secreted and signals to the liver, where it contributes to the homeostasis of bile acid (BA), lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. FGF19 is a promising therapeutic target for the metabolic syndrome and cholestatic diseases, but enthusiasm for its use has been tempered by FGF19-mediated induction of proliferation and hepatocellular carcinoma. To inform future rational design of FGF19-variants, we have conducted temporal quantitative proteomic and gene expression analyses to identify FGF19-targets related to metabolism and proliferation. Mice were fasted for 16 hours, and injected with human FGF19 (1 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle. Liver protein extracts (containing ""light"" lysine) were mixed 1:1 with a spike-in protein extract from 13C6-lysine metabolically labelled mouse liver (containing ""heavy"" lysine) and analysed by LC-MS/MS. Our analyses provide a resource of FGF19 target proteins in the liver. 189 proteins were upregulated (≥ 1.5 folds) and 73 proteins were downregulated (≤ -1.5 folds) by FGF19. FGF19 treatment decreased the expression of proteins involved in fatty acid (FA) synthesis, i.e., Fabp5, Scd1, and Acsl3 and increased the expression of Acox1, involved in FA oxidation. As expected, FGF19 increased the expression of proteins known to drive proliferation (i.e., Tgfbi, Vcam1, Anxa2 and Hdlbp). Importantly, many of the FGF19 targets (i.e., Pdk4, Apoa4, Fas and Stat3) have a dual function in both metabolism and cell proliferation. Therefore, our findings challenge the development of FGF19-variants that fully uncouple metabolic benefit from mitogenic potential.",1
28167849,"Arterial stiffness is associated with cardiovascular risk, morbidity, and mortality. The present paper reviews the main vitamins related to arterial stiffness and enabling destiffening, their mechanisms of action, providing a brief description of the latest studies in the area, and their implications for primary cardiovascular prevention, clinical practice, and therapy. Despite inconsistent evidence for destiffening induced by vitamin supplementation in several randomized clinical trials, positive results were obtained in specific populations. The main mechanisms are related to antiatherogenic effects, improvement of endothelial function (vitamins A, C, D, and E) and metabolic profile (vitamins A, B12, C, D, and K), inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (vitamin D), anti-inflammatory (vitamins A, D, E, and K) and antioxidant effects (vitamins A, C, and E), decrease of homocysteine level (vitamin B12), and reversing calcification of arteries (vitamin K). Vitamins A, B12, C, D, E, and K status is important in evaluating cardiovascular risk, and vitamin supplementation may be an effective, individualized, and inexpensive destiffening therapy.",0
28146470,"Height is a highly heritable, classic polygenic trait with approximately 700 common associated variants identified through genome-wide association studies so far. Here, we report 83 height-associated coding variants with lower minor-allele frequencies (in the range of 0.1-4.8%) and effects of up to 2 centimetres per allele (such as those in IHH, STC2, AR and CRISPLD2), greater than ten times the average effect of common variants. In functional follow-up studies, rare height-increasing alleles of STC2 (giving an increase of 1-2 centimetres per allele) compromised proteolytic inhibition of PAPP-A and increased cleavage of IGFBP-4 in vitro, resulting in higher bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors. These 83 height-associated variants overlap genes that are mutated in monogenic growth disorders and highlight new biological candidates (such as ADAMTS3, IL11RA and NOX4) and pathways (such as proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan synthesis) involved in growth. Our results demonstrate that sufficiently large sample sizes can uncover rare and low-frequency variants of moderate-to-large effect associated with polygenic human phenotypes, and that these variants implicate relevant genes and pathways.",1
28131821,"Processed genes are functional genes that have arisen as a result of the retrotransposition of mRNA molecules. We found 6 genes that generated processed genes in the common ancestor of five Brassicaceae species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Arabidopsis lyrata, Capsella rubella, Brassica rapa and Thellungiella parvula). These processed genes have therefore been kept for at least 30millionyears. Analyses of the Ka/Ks ratio of these genes, and of those having given rise to them, show that they evolve relatively slowly and suggest that the processed genes maintained the same function as that of their parental gene. There is a significant negative correlation between the number of ESTs and transcripts produced and the Ka/Ks ratios of the parental genes but not of the processed genes. This suggests that selection has not yet adapted the selective pressure the processed genes experience to their expression level. However, the A. thaliana processed genes tend to be expressed in the same tissues as that of their parental genes. Furthermore, most have a CAATT-box, a TATA-box and are located about 1kb from another protein-coding gene. Altogether, our results suggest that the processed genes found in the A. thaliana genome have been kept to produce more of the same product, and in the same tissues, as that encoded by their parental gene.",1
28126286,"Understanding how genomes change as organisms become more complex is a central question in evolution. Molecular evolutionary studies typically correlate the appearance of genes and gene families with the emergence of biological pathways and morphological features. While such approaches are of great importance to understand how organisms evolve, they are also limited, as functionally related genes work together in contexts of dynamic gene networks. Since functionally related genes are often transcriptionally coregulated, gene coexpression networks present a resource to study the evolution of biological pathways. In this opinion article, we discuss recent developments in this field and how coexpression analyses can be merged with existing genomic approaches to transfer functional knowledge between species to study the appearance or extension of pathways.",0
28116828,"The leap from simple unicellularity to complex multicellularity remains one of life's major enigmas. The origins of metazoan developmental gene regulatory mechanisms are sought by analyzing gene regulation in extant eumetazoans, sponges, and unicellular organisms. The main hypothesis of this manuscript is that, developmental enhancers evolved from unicellular inducible promoters that diversified the expression of regulatory genes during metazoan evolution. Promoters and enhancers are functionally similar; both can regulate the transcription of distal promoters and both direct local transcription. Additionally, enhancers have experimentally characterized structural features that reveal their origin from inducible promoters. The distal co-operative regulation among promoters identified in unicellular opisthokonts possibly represents the precursor of distal regulation of promoters by enhancers. During metazoan evolution, constitutive-type promoters of regulatory genes would have acquired novel receptivity to distal regulatory inputs from promoters of inducible genes that eventually specialized as enhancers. The novel regulatory interactions would have caused constitutively expressed genes controlling differential gene expression in unicellular organisms to become themselves differentially expressed. The consequence of the novel regulatory interactions was that regulatory pathways of unicellular organisms became interlaced and ultimately evolved into the intricate developmental gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of extant metazoans.",0
28108526,"Lipid exchange between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and peroxisomes is necessary for the synthesis and catabolism of lipids, the trafficking of cholesterol, and peroxisome biogenesis in mammalian cells. However, how lipids are exchanged between these two organelles is not understood. In this study, we report that the ER-resident VAMP-associated proteins A and B (VAPA and VAPB) interact with the peroxisomal membrane protein acyl-CoA binding domain containing 5 (ACBD5) and that this interaction is required to tether the two organelles together, thereby facilitating the lipid exchange between them. Depletion of either ACBD5 or VAP expression results in increased peroxisome mobility, suggesting that VAP-ACBD5 complex acts as the primary ER-peroxisome tether. We also demonstrate that tethering of peroxisomes to the ER is necessary for peroxisome growth, the synthesis of plasmalogen phospholipids, and the maintenance of cellular cholesterol levels. Collectively, our data highlight the importance of VAP-ACBD5-mediated contact between the ER and peroxisomes for organelle maintenance and lipid homeostasis.",1

28095712,"Despite many recent advances in the HIV prevention landscape, an effective vaccine remains the most promising tool to end the HIV-1 pandemic. Areas covered: This review summarizes past HIV vaccine efficacy trials and current vaccine strategies as well as new approaches about to move into first-in-human trials. Expert opinion: Despite many setbacks in early HIV vaccine efficacy trials, the success of RV144 has provided the glimmer of hope necessary to invigorate the vaccine field, and has led to the development of a large number of vaccine strategies aiming at inducing an array of different immune responses. The follow-up pox-protein trials, developed to replicate and enhance the polyfunctional antibody responses induced by the RV144 regimen, are already reaching efficacy trials, while a large body of work providing a more complete understanding of the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies is now being translated into immunogen design using several different strategies. T-cell based vaccines, fallen out of favor after Ad5-based trials showed increased infection rates in Ad5 seropositive vaccine recipients, are experiencing a comeback based in part on the promising results from non-human primate challenge studies using rhCMV-based immunogens. This diverse array of vaccine candidates may finally allow us to identify a broadly effective HIV vaccine able to contain the epidemic.",1

28067899,"Heritable thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD), including Marfan syndrome (MFS), currently lack a cure, and causative mutations have been identified for only a fraction of affected families. Here we identify the metalloproteinase ADAMTS1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) as therapeutic targets in individuals with TAAD. We show that Adamts1 is a major mediator of vascular homeostasis, given that genetic haploinsufficiency of Adamts1 in mice causes TAAD similar to MFS. Aortic nitric oxide and Nos2 levels were higher in Adamts1-deficient mice and in a mouse model of MFS (hereafter referred to as MFS mice), and Nos2 inactivation protected both types of mice from aortic pathology. Pharmacological inhibition of Nos2 rapidly reversed aortic dilation and medial degeneration in young Adamts1-deficient mice and in young or old MFS mice. Patients with MFS showed elevated NOS2 and decreased ADAMTS1 protein levels in the aorta. These findings uncover a possible causative role for the ADAMTS1-NOS2 axis in human TAAD and warrant evaluation of NOS2 inhibitors for therapy.",1
28067311,"Adaptation of bacteria occurs predominantly via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). While it is widely recognized that horizontal acquisitions frequently encompass multiple genes, it is unclear what the size distribution of successfully transferred DNA segments looks like and what evolutionary forces shape this distribution. Here, we identified 1790 gene family pairs that were consistently co-gained on the same branches across a phylogeny of 53 E. coli strains. We estimated a lower limit of their genomic distances at the time they were transferred to their host genomes; this distribution shows a sharp upper bound at 30 kb. The same gene-pairs can have larger distances (up to 70 kb) in other genomes. These more distant pairs likely represent recent acquisitions via transduction that involve the co-transfer of excised prophage genes, as they are almost always associated with intervening phage-associated genes. The observed distribution of genomic distances of co-transferred genes is much broader than expected from a model based on the co-transfer of genes within operons; instead, this distribution is highly consistent with the size distribution of supra-operonic clusters (SOCs), groups of co-occurring and co-functioning genes that extend beyond operons. Thus, we propose that SOCs form a basic unit of horizontal gene transfer.",0

28056993,"Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by reversible airway obstruction with persistent airway inflammation and airway remodeling, which is associated with increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated in inflammatory and airway blood vessel remodeling in asthma. Recent evidence indicates that a deficiency of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) may influence asthma pathogenesis. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)33 has been identified as playing a role in the pathophysiology of asthma. ADAM33, which is expressed in ASM cells, is suggested to play a role in the function of these cells. Recent studies show that 1,25-(OH)2D3 exerts direct inhibitory effects on passively sensitized human ASM cells in vitro, including inhibition of ADAM33 expression and cell proliferation; however, the mechanism has not been fully understood.",1
28055957,"Chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis is attracting increasing attention because it heralds an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing surgery because of liver metastases. The aim of this study was to develop in vitro and in vivo models to analyze the pathogenesis of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced steatohepatitis.Therefore, primary human hepatocytes and HepG2 hepatoma cells were incubated with 5-FU at non-toxic concentrations up to 24 h. Furthermore, hepatic tissue of C57BL/6N mice was analyzed 24 h after application of a single 5-FU dose (200 mg/kg body weight). In vitro, incubation with 5-FU induced a significant increase of hepatocellular triglyceride levels. This was paralleled by an impairment of mitochondrial function and a dose- and time-dependently increased expression of fatty acid acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), which catalyzes the initial step for peroxisomal β-oxidation. The latter is known to generate reactive oxygen species, and consequently, expression of the antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) was significantly upregulated in 5-FU-treated cells, indicative for oxidative stress. Furthermore, 5-FU significantly induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes IL-8 and ICAM-1. Also in vivo, 5-FU significantly induced hepatic ACOX1 and HMOX1 expression as well as JNK-activation, pro-inflammatory gene expression and immune cell infiltration. In summary, we identified molecular mechanisms by which 5-FU induces hepatocellular lipid accumulation and inflammation. Our newly developed models can be used to gain further insight into the pathogenesis of 5-FU-induced steatohepatitis and to develop therapeutic strategies to inhibit its development and progression.",1
28051079,"Neuropathic pain-like joint symptoms (NP) are seen in a proportion of individuals diagnosed with osteoarthritis (OA) and post total joint replacement (TJR). In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using NP as defined by the painDETECT questionnaire (score >12 indicating possible NP) in 613 post-TJR participants recruited from Nottinghamshire (UK). The prevalence of possible NP was 17.8%. The top four hits from the GWAS and two other biologically relevant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were replicated in individuals with OA and post TJR from an independent study in the same area (N=908) and in individuals from the Rotterdam Study (N=212). Three of these SNPs showed effect sizes in the same direction as in the GWAS results in both replication cohorts. The strongest association upon meta-analysis of a recessive model was for the variant allele in rs887797 mapping to the protein kinase C alpha (PRKCA) gene odds ratio (OR)<sub>possNP</sub>=2.41 (95% CI 1.74-3.34, P=1.29 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). This SNP has been found to be associated with multiple sclerosis and encodes a functional variant affecting splicing and expression of the PRKCA gene. The PRKCA gene has been associated with long-term potentiation, synaptic plasticity, chronic pain and memory in the literature, making this a biologically relevant finding.",1
28049137,"Transcription networks consist of hundreds of transcription factors with thousands of often overlapping target genes. While we can reliably measure gene expression changes, we still understand relatively little why expression changes the way it does. How does a coordinated response emerge in such complex networks and how many input signals are necessary to achieve it? Here, we unravel the regulatory program of gene expression in Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism with more than 30 known transcription factors. Using a library of fluorescent transcriptional reporters, we comprehensively quantify the activity of central metabolic promoters in 26 environmental conditions. The expression patterns were dominated by growth rate-dependent global regulation for most central metabolic promoters in concert with highly condition-specific activation for only few promoters. Using an approximate mathematical description of promoter activity, we dissect the contribution of global and specific transcriptional regulation. About 70% of the total variance in promoter activity across conditions was explained by global transcriptional regulation. Correlating the remaining specific transcriptional regulation of each promoter with the cell's metabolome response across the same conditions identified potential regulatory metabolites. Remarkably, cyclic AMP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, and fructose-1-phosphate alone explained most of the specific transcriptional regulation through their interaction with the two major transcription factors Crp and Cra. Thus, a surprisingly simple regulatory program that relies on global transcriptional regulation and input from few intracellular metabolites appears to be sufficient to coordinate E. coli central metabolism and explain about 90% of the experimentally observed transcription changes in 100 genes.",0
28043002,"Precision nutrition encompasses prevention and treatment strategies for optimizing health that consider individual variability in diet, lifestyle, environment and genes by accurately determining an individual's nutritional status. This is particularly important as malnutrition now affects a third of the global population, with most of those affected or their care providers having limited means of determining their nutritional status. Similarly, program implementers often have no way of determining the impact or success of their interventions, thus hindering their scale-up. Exciting new developments in the area of point-of-care diagnostics promise to provide improved access to nutritional status assessment, as a first step towards enabling precision nutrition and tailored interventions at both the individual and community levels. In this review, we focus on the current advances in developing portable diagnostics for assessment of nutritional status at point-of-care, along with the numerous design challenges in this process and potential solutions.",0

27998979,"Glucocorticoids are a general class of steroids that possess renoprotective activity in glomeruli through their interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor. However, the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids ameliorate proteinuria and glomerular disease are not well understood. In this study, we demonstrated that α actinin 4 (ACTN4), an actin-cross-linking protein known to coordinate cytoskeletal organization, interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the nucleus of human podocytes (HPCs), a key cell type in the glomerulus critical for kidney filtration function. The GR-ACTN4 complex enhances glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-driven reporter activity. Stable knockdown of ACTN4 by shRNA in HPCs significantly reduces dexamethasone-mediated induction of GR target genes and GRE-driven reporter activity without disrupting dexamethasone-induced nuclear translocation of GR. Synonymous mutations or protein expression losses in ACTN4 are associated with kidney diseases, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, characterized by proteinuria and podocyte injury. We found that focal segmental glomerulosclerosis-linked ACTN4 mutants lose their ability to bind liganded GR and support GRE-mediated transcriptional activity. Mechanistically, GR and ACTN4 interact in the nucleus of HPCs. Furthermore, disruption of the LXXLL nuclear receptor-interacting motif present in ACTN4 results in reduced GR interaction and dexamethasone-mediated transactivation of a GRE reporter while still maintaining its actin-binding activity. In contrast, an ACTN4 isoform, ACTN4 (Iso), that loses its actin-binding domain is still capable of potentiating a GRE reporter. Dexamethasone induces the recruitment of ACTN4 and GR to putative GREs in dexamethasone-transactivated promoters, SERPINE1, ANGPLT4, CCL20, and SAA1 as well as the NF-κB (p65) binding sites on GR-transrepressed promoters such as IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 Taken together, our data establish ACTN4 as a transcriptional co-regulator that modulates both dexamethasone-transactivated and -transrepressed genes in podocytes.",1
27994121,"Gene duplications and gene losses have been frequent events in the evolution of animal genomes, with the balance between these two dynamic processes contributing to major differences in gene number between species. After gene duplication, it is common for both daughter genes to accumulate sequence change at approximately equal rates. In some cases, however, the accumulation of sequence change is highly uneven with one copy radically diverging from its paralogue. Such 'asymmetric evolution' seems commoner after tandem gene duplication than after whole-genome duplication, and can generate substantially novel genes. We describe examples of asymmetric evolution in duplicated homeobox genes of moths, molluscs and mammals, in each case generating new homeobox genes that were recruited to novel developmental roles. The prevalence of asymmetric divergence of gene duplicates has been underappreciated, in part, because the origin of highly divergent genes can be difficult to resolve using standard phylogenetic methods.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evo-devo in the genomics era, and the origins of morphological diversity'.",1
27992526,"Strong evidence suggests that lipid metabolism (LM) has an essential role in tumor growth to support special energetic and structural requirements of tumor cells. Recently, overexpression of LM-related genes, apolipoproteins related to metabolic syndrome, and ACSL/SCD network involved in fatty acid activation have been proposed as prognostic markers of colon cancer (CC). Furthermore, activation of this latter lipid network has been recently demonstrated to confer invasive and stem cell properties to tumor cells promoting tumor aggressiveness and patient relapse. With the aim of elucidating whether any genetic variation within these genes could influence basal expression levels and consequent susceptibility to relapse, we genotype, in 284 CC patients, 57 polymorphisms located in the 7 genes of these lipid networks previously associated with worse clinical outcome of CC patients (ABCA1, ACSL1, AGPAT1, APOA2, APOC1, APOC2 and SCD), some of them related to CC aggressiveness. After adjusting with clinical confounding factors and multiple comparisons, an association between genotype and disease-free survival (DFS) was shown for rs8086 in 3'-UTR of ACSL1 gene (HR 3.08; 95% CI 1.69-5.63; adjusted p = 0.046). Furthermore, the risk T/T genotype had significantly higher ACSL1 gene expression levels than patients carrying C/T or C/C genotype (means = 5.34; 3.73; 2.37 respectively; p-value (ANOVA) = 0.019), suggesting a functional role of this variant. Thus, we have identified a ""risk genotype"" of ACSL1 gene that confers constitutive high levels of the enzyme, which is involved in the activation of fatty acids through conversion to acyl-CoA and has been recently related to increased invasiveness of tumor cells. These results suggest that rs8086 of ACSL1 could be a promising prognostic marker in CC patients, reinforcing the relevance of LM in the progression of CC.",1
27989736,"Our ability to genetically manipulate microbial systems is often hampered by the availability of genetic tools. Thus, there is a need for the continued expansion of our molecular tool box. In support of this expansion, this study reports the design, construction, and validation of a new bicistronic shuttle vector series, pDUO, for the dual expression of genes in different hosts. Each vector was designed and constructed to contain two araC-p<sub>BAD</sub> inducible promoter systems for tight control over gene expression. Each araC-p<sub>BAD</sub> promoter precedes a ribosomal binding site and a multicloning site (MCS). The 5' end of MCS1 contains a sequence encoding an affinity HIS-tag N-terminus and MCS2 terminates with a sequence encoding an affinity S-tag C-terminus for one-step purification of recombinant proteins encoded by the inserted genes. Both MCS are followed by an rrnBT1 and T2 transcriptional terminator sequence. Each vector in this series also contains a PBR322 and pRO1600-derived replicon to support replication in different host bacteria along with one of four different selectable markers. The functionality of the pDUO vector series was validated through the dual expression of oxalate biosynthetic component (obc) 1 and mrfp in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens. It is anticipated that this new vector series will facilitate functional studies as well as the engineering of bacterial strains for biotechnological purposes.",1

27980647,"Population-based identity by descent (IBD) mapping is a statistical method for detection of genetic loci that share an ancestral segment among ""unrelated"" pairs of individuals for a disease. As a complementary method to genome-wide association studies, IBD mapping is robust to allelic heterogeneity and may identify rare inherited variants when combined with sequence data. Our objective is to identify the causal genes for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). We applied a population-based IBD mapping method to 105 unrelated individuals selected from the family data provided for the Genetic Analysis Workshop 19. Using the genome-wide association study data (ie, the microarray data), chromosome 3 was scanned for IBD sharing segments among all pairs of these individuals. At the chromosomal region with the most significant relationship between IBD sharing and DBP, the whole genome sequence data were examined to identify the risk variants for DBP. The most significant chromosomal region that was identified to have a relationship between the IBD sharing and DBP was at 3q12.3 (<i>p</i> = 0.0016), although it did not achieve the chromosome-wide significance level (<i>p</i> = 0.00012). This chromosomal region contains 1 gene, <i>ZPLD1</i>, which has been reported to be associated with cerebral cavernous malformations, a disease with enlarged small blood vessels (capillaries) in the brain. Although 24 deleterious variants were identified at this region, no significant association was found between these variants and DBP (<i>p</i> = 0.40). We presented a mapping strategy which combined a population-based IBD mapping method with sequence data analyses. One gene was located at a chromosomal region identified by this method for DBP. However, further study with a large sample size is needed to assess this result.",1
27965376,"The increasing size of timetrees in recent years has led to a focus on diversification analyses to better understand patterns of macroevolution. Thus far, nearly all studies have been conducted with eukaryotes primarily because phylogenies have been more difficult to reconstruct and calibrate to geologic time in prokaryotes. Here, we have estimated a timetree of 11,784 'species' of prokaryotes and explored their pattern of diversification. We used data from the small subunit ribosomal RNA along with an evolutionary framework from previous multi-gene studies to produce three alternative timetrees. For each timetree we surprisingly found a constant net diversification rate derived from an exponential increase of lineages and showing no evidence of saturation (rate decline), the same pattern found previously in eukaryotes. The implication is that prokaryote diversification as a whole is the result of the random splitting of lineages and is neither limited by existing diversity (filled niches) nor responsive in any major way to environmental changes.",0

27913843,"In the 1960s, advances in protein chemistry and molecular genetics provided new means for the study of biological evolution. Amino acid sequencing, nucleic acid hybridization, zone gel electrophoresis, and immunochemistry were some of the experimental techniques that brought about new perspectives to the study of the patterns and mechanisms of evolution. New concepts, such as the molecular evolutionary clock, and the discovery of unexpected molecular phenomena, like the presence of repetitive sequences in eukaryotic genomes, eventually led to the realization that evolution might occur at a different pace at the organismic and the molecular levels, and according to different mechanisms. These developments sparked important debates between defendants of the molecular and organismic approaches. The most vocal confrontations focused on the relation between primates and humans, and the neutral theory of molecular evolution. By the 1980s and 1990s, the construction of large protein and DNA sequences databases, and the development of computer-based statistical tools, facilitated the coming together of molecular and evolutionary biology. Although in its contemporary form the field of molecular evolution can be traced back to the last five decades, the field has deep roots in twentieth century experimental life sciences.

27911795,"Excessive alcohol consumption is a major public health problem worldwide. Although drinking habits are known to be inherited, few genes have been identified that are robustly linked to alcohol drinking.

We show that brain-specific β-Klotho KO mice have an increased alcohol preference and that FGF21 inhibits alcohol drinking by acting on the brain. These data suggest that a liver-brain endocrine axis may play an important role in the regulation of alcohol drinking behavior and provide a unique pharmacologic target for reducing alcohol consumption.",1

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the clinical significance of miR-206 and its target gene YRDC in human bladder cancer, and to determine its effects on oncogenic phenotypes of this disease. Our results showed that miR-206 expression was downregulated significantly in bladder cancer tissues and cell lines compared with adjacent normal bladder tissues and human bladder epithelial immortalized SV-HUC-1 cell line, respectively. Overexpression of miR-206 reduced the expression of YRDC and inhibited bladder cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion and induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. In addition, knockdown of YRDC exhibited similar effects with miR-206 overexpression in bladder cancer cells and restoration of YRDC partially reversed the effects of miR-206 in bladder cancer cells.

Such interesting electronic properties are not realized in two-dimensional (2D) Si honeycomb lattices prepared recently on metallic substrates where the crystal and hybrid electronic structures of these 'epitaxial silicene' phases are strongly influenced by the substrate, and thus different from those predicted for isolated 2D structures. While the realization of such low-dimensional Si <i>π</i> materials has hardly been imagined previously, it is evident that the materials science behind silicene remains challenging. In this contribution, we will review our recent results that lead to an enhanced understanding of epitaxial silicene formed on diboride thin films, and discuss the remaining challenges that must be addressed in order to turn Si 2D nanostructures into technologically interesting nanoelectronic materials.",0
27875799,"Genetically modified (GM) techniques to improve the nutrition and health content of foods is a highly debated area riddled with ethical dilemmas. Assessing GM technology with a public health ethical framework, this paper identifies public health goals, the potential burdens of the technology, and areas to consider for minimizing burdens and ensuring beneficence, autonomy, and little infringements on justice. Both policymakers and food producers should acknowledge local food environments and the agricultural context of each community in order to effectively prepare communication strategies and equitably distribute any proposed GM food intervention.",0
27862978,"Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and clopidogrel combined therapy has been reported to be beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Antiplatelet drug resistance, especially to clopidogrel, is a multifactorial phenomenon that affects a large number of ACS patients. The genetic contribution to this drug response is not fully elucidated. We investigated the relationship of ABC-type efflux subfamily C member 3 (ABCC3) polymorphisms and mRNA expression with plasma concentrations of clopidogrel, salicylic acid (SA) and a carboxylic acid metabolite (CAM). Clopidogrel, CAM and SA plasma concentrations were measured simultaneously by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) from 83 ACS patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. ABCC3 (rs757421, rs733392 and rs739923) and CYP2C19*2 (rs4244285) polymorphisms as well as mRNA expression were evaluated. A positive correlation was found between CAM concentrations and ABCC3 mRNA expression (r = 0.494, p < 0.0001). Patients carrying genotype AA (rs757421 variant) had higher CAM concentrations and ABCC3 mRNA expression as compared to those of GG + GA carriers (p = 0.017). A multiple linear regression analysis revealed that ABCC3 mRNA expression (p = 0.017), rs757421 AA genotype (p = 0.001), blood collection time (p = 0.018) and clopidogrel dose (p = 0.001) contributed to the concentration of CAM. No associations were observed for the CYP2C19*2 polymorphism. These results suggest that up-regulation of ABCC3 mRNA expression leads to increased plasma CAM levels through MRP3-mediated cell efflux. The ABCC3 rs757421 polymorphism may contribute to gene expression. Therefore, ABCC3 may be a potential biomarker for the response to clopidogrel.",1
27859260,"The expression of A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 8 (ADAM8) is associated with several inflammatory diseases. Elevated ADAM8 levels have been shown in gingival crevicular fluid of patients with chronic periodontitis.

ADAM8 expression and its inductive mechanism were examined in human gingival epithelial cells (HGECs) and human gingival fibroblasts.",1
27857161,"Breast cancer is commonest cancer in women worldwide. Elucidation of underlying biology and molecular pathways is necessary for improving therapeutic options and clinical outcomes. Molecular alterations in breast cancer are complex and involve cross-talk between multiple signaling pathways. The aim of this study is to extract a unique mRNA fingerprint of breast cancer in Lebanese women using microarray technologies. Gene-expression profiles of 94 fresh breast tissue samples (84 cancerous/10 non-tumor adjacent samples) were analyzed using GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Quantitative real-time PCR was employed to validate candidate genes. Differentially expressed genes between breast cancer and non-tumor tissues were screened. Significant differences in gene expression were established for COL11A1/COL10A1/MMP1/COL6A6/DLK1/S100P/CXCL11/SOX11/LEP/ADIPOQ/OXTR/FOSL1/ACSBG1 and C21orf37. Pathways/diseases representing these genes were retrieved and linked using PANTHER<sup>®</sup>/Pathway Studio<sup>®</sup>. Many of the deregulated genes are associated with extracellular matrix, inflammation, angiogenesis, metastasis, differentiation, cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Characteristics of breast cancers in Lebanese were compared to those of women from Western populations to explain why breast cancer is more aggressive and presents a decade earlier in Lebanese victims. Delineating molecular mechanisms of breast cancer in Lebanese women led to key genes which could serve as potential biomarkers and/or novel drug targets for breast cancer.",1
27846808,"Transitions between perennial and an annual life history occur often in plant lineages, but the genes that control whether a plant is an annual or perennial are largely unknown. To identify genes that confer differences between annuals and perennials we compared the gene content of four pairs of sister lineages (Arabidopsis thaliana/Arabidopsis lyrata, Arabis montbretiana/Arabis alpina, Arabis verna/Aubrieta parviflora and Draba nemorosa/Draba hispanica) in the Brassicaceae in which each pair contains one annual and one perennial, plus one extra annual species (Capsella rubella).",0
27844209,"Primary hyperparathyroidism has been associated with increased incidence of morbidity and mortality of the cardiovascular system. The etiopathogenetic mechanisms underlying this association are still not completely clear. Accumulating evidence suggested that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin-like motifs (ADAMTS) has a role in the development of inflammation and atherosclerosis. In this study, we aimed to determine whether there is a change in serum levels of ADAMTS1, ADAMTS4, carotid intima-media thickness, and cardiovascular risk score after the surgery and also whether there is a relationship between ADAMTS levels and cardiovascular risk score in hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism patients.",1
27842070,"Ferroptosis is a form of regulated necrotic cell death controlled by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). At present, mechanisms that could predict sensitivity and/or resistance and that may be exploited to modulate ferroptosis are needed. We applied two independent approaches-a genome-wide CRISPR-based genetic screen and microarray analysis of ferroptosis-resistant cell lines-to uncover acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) as an essential component for ferroptosis execution. Specifically, Gpx4-Acsl4 double-knockout cells showed marked resistance to ferroptosis. Mechanistically, ACSL4 enriched cellular membranes with long polyunsaturated ω6 fatty acids. Moreover, ACSL4 was preferentially expressed in a panel of basal-like breast cancer cell lines and predicted their sensitivity to ferroptosis. Pharmacological targeting of ACSL4 with thiazolidinediones, a class of antidiabetic compound, ameliorated tissue demise in a mouse model of ferroptosis, suggesting that ACSL4 inhibition is a viable therapeutic approach to preventing ferroptosis-related diseases.",1
27838634,"The incidence of liver cancer has increased in recent years. Worldwide, liver cancer is common: more than 600000 related deaths are estimated each year. In the USA, about 27170 deaths due to liver cancer are estimated for 2016. Liver cancer is highly resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. For all stages combined, the 5-year survival rate is 15-17%, leaving much to be desired for liver cancer prevention and therapy. Heterogeneity, which can originate from genomic instability, is one reason for poor outcome. About 80-90% of liver cancers are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and recent cancer genome sequencing studies have revealed frequently mutated genes in HCC. In this review, we discuss the cause of the tumor heterogeneity based on the functions of genes that are frequently mutated in HCC. We overview the functions of the genes that are most frequently mutated (e.g. TP53, CTNNB1, AXIN1, ARID1A and WWP1) that portray major pathways leading to HCC and identify the roles of these genes in preventing genomic instability. Notably, the pathway analysis suggested that oxidative stress management may be critical to prevent accumulation of DNA damage and further mutations. We propose that both chromosome instability (CIN) and microsatellite instability (MIN) are integral to the hepatic carcinogenesis process leading to heterogeneity in HCC and that the pathways leading to heterogeneity may be targeted for prognosis, prevention and treatment.",1
27835795,"Animal breeders have used a variety of methods in selective breeding programs to genetically improve food animal species. Recently this has included the use of both genetic engineering and genome editing, particularly for targeting improvement in traits for which there is no within-species or within-breed genetic variation. Both intraspecies and interspecies allele substitutions and gene knock-ins have been accomplished with genome editing tools, targeting a number of important traits. The regulatory status of such animals is unclear as the definition of a regulated article is not consistent among different regulatory agencies and organizations. In the absence of a harmonized global regulatory approach to the genetic improvement of animals, it will be difficult for breeders to effectively achieve sustainable breeding objectives.",0
27830327,"Microcystic stromal tumors (MCST), first described in 2009 by Irving et al., are rare ovarian neoplasms. The entity was introduced into the 2014 WHO classification of tumors of female reproductive organs in the group of sex cord-stromal tumors, which is rather heterogeneous. We studied three cases of ovarian tumor with the characteristic morphological features and immunohistochemical marker profiles of MCST. The three tumors showed micro, and macrocystic patterns with solid areas, and were composed of small round to spindle-shaped cells, without atypia. The tumors diffusely and strongly expressed CD10, FOXL2, and nuclear β-catenin, but without immmunoreactivity for hormone receptors, calretinin, or inhibin. Genome analyses showed no somatic mutation of exon 1 of the FOXL2 gene and of exons 24 and 25 of DICER1 gene, the latter not having been reported previously. The patients are well, without evidence of tumor progression 1 to 10 years after diagnosis.The absence of FOXL2 and DICER1 gene mutation, along with strong FOXL2 immunoreactivity provides additional evidence to place MCST within pure gonadal stromal rather than sex cord ovarian tumors.",1
27829000,"Recovering gene regulatory networks from expression data is a challenging problem in systems biology that provides valuable information on the regulatory mechanisms of cells. A number of algorithms based on computational models are currently used to recover network topology. However, most of these algorithms have limitations. For example, many models tend to be complicated because of the ""large p, small n"" problem. In this paper, we propose a novel regulatory network inference method called the maximum-relevance and maximum-significance network (MRMSn) method, which converts the problem of recovering networks into a problem of how to select the regulator genes for each gene. To solve the latter problem, we present an algorithm that is based on information theory and selects the regulator genes for a specific gene by maximizing the relevance and significance. A first-order incremental search algorithm is used to search for regulator genes. Eventually, a strict constraint is adopted to adjust all of the regulatory relationships according to the obtained regulator genes and thus obtain the complete network structure. We performed our method on five different datasets and compared our method to five state-of-the-art methods for network inference based on information theory. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method.",0
27824142,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a heritable disease that affects more than thirty million individuals worldwide. Extensive efforts have been devoted to the study of genetic determinants of AF. The objective of our study is to examine the effect of gene-gene interaction on AF susceptibility. We performed a large-scale association analysis of gene-gene interactions with AF in 8,173 AF cases, and 65,237 AF-free referents collected from 15 studies for discovery. We examined putative interactions between genome-wide SNPs and 17 known AF-related SNPs. The top interactions were then tested for association in an independent cohort for replication, which included more than 2,363 AF cases and 114,746 AF-free referents. One interaction, between rs7164883 at the HCN4 locus and rs4980345 at the SLC28A1 locus, was found to be significantly associated with AF in the discovery cohorts (interaction OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.27-1.65, P = 4.3 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). Eight additional gene-gene interactions were also marginally significant (P < 5 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). However, none of the top interactions were replicated. In summary, we did not find significant interactions that were associated with AF susceptibility. Future increases in sample size and denser genotyping might facilitate the identification of gene-gene interactions associated with AF.",1
27821203,"Immunosenescence during ageing is a major challenge which weakens the ability of older individuals to respond to infection or vaccination. There has been much interest in dietary strategies to improve immunity in older people, but there is an assumption that modulation of the immune response in older people will be based on the same principles as for younger adults. Recent evidence suggests that ageing fundamentally alters the impact of nutrition on immune function. As a result, interpretation of data from studies investigating the impact of diet on immune function is highly dependent on subject age. Study design is critically important when investigating the efficacy of dietary components, and most studies involving older people include rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria based on medical history, laboratory tests, general health status and often nutritional status. However, immunological status is rarely accounted for, but can vary significantly, even amongst healthy older people. There are several clear examples of age-related changes in immune cell composition, phenotype and/or function, which can directly alter the outcome of an intervention. This review uses two case studies to illustrate how the effects of n-3 PUFA and probiotics differ markedly in young v. older subjects. Evidence from both suggests that baseline differences in immunosenescence influence the outcome of an intervention, highlighting the need for detailed immunological characterisation of subjects prior to interventions. Finally, future work elucidating alterations in metabolic regulation within cells of the immune system as a result of ageing may be important in understanding the impact of diet on immune function in older people.",0
27799384,"The U-BIOPRED study is a multicentre European study aimed at a better understanding of severe asthma. It included three steroid-treated adult asthma groups (severe nonsmokers (SAn group), severe current/ex-smokers (SAs/ex group) and those with mild-moderate disease (MMA group)) and healthy controls (HC group). The aim of this cross-sectional, bronchoscopy substudy was to compare bronchial immunopathology between these groups.In 158 participants, bronchial biopsies and bronchial epithelial brushings were collected for immunopathologic and transcriptomic analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis of glycol methacrylate resin-embedded biopsies showed there were more mast cells in submucosa of the HC group (33.6 mm<sup>-2</sup>) compared with both severe asthma groups (SAn: 17.4 mm<sup>-2</sup>, p<0.001; SAs/ex: 22.2 mm<sup>-2</sup>, p=0.01) and with the MMA group (21.2 mm<sup>-2</sup>, p=0.01). The number of CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes was decreased in the SAs/ex group (4.7 mm<sup>-2</sup>) compared with the SAn (11.6 mm<sup>-2</sup>, p=0.002), MMA (10.1 mm<sup>-2</sup>, p=0.008) and HC (10.6 mm<sup>-2</sup>, p<0.001) groups. No other differences were observed.Affymetrix microarray analysis identified seven probe sets in the bronchial brushing samples that had a positive relationship with submucosal eosinophils. These mapped to COX-2 (cyclo-oxygenase-2), ADAM-7 (disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 7), SLCO1A2 (solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1A2), TMEFF2 (transmembrane protein with epidermal growth factor like and two follistatin like domains 2) and TRPM-1 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 1); the remaining two are unnamed.We conclude that in nonsmoking and smoking patients on currently recommended therapy, severe asthma exists despite suppressed tissue inflammation within the proximal airway wall.",1
27791010,"Carcinosarcomas (CSs) of the uterus and ovary are highly aggressive neoplasms containing both carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements. We analyzed the mutational landscape of 68 uterine and ovarian CSs by whole-exome sequencing. We also performed multiregion whole-exome sequencing comprising two carcinoma and sarcoma samples from six tumors to resolve their evolutionary histories. The results demonstrated that carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements derive from a common precursor having mutations typical of carcinomas. In addition to mutations in cancer genes previously identified in uterine and ovarian carcinomas such as TP53, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A, KRAS, PTEN, CHD4, and BCOR, we found an excess of mutations in genes encoding histone H2A and H2B, as well as significant amplification of the segment of chromosome 6p harboring the histone gene cluster containing these genes. We also found frequent deletions of the genes TP53 and MBD3 (a member with CHD4 of the nucleosome remodeling deacetylase complex) and frequent amplification of chromosome segments containing the genes PIK3CA, TERT, and MYC Stable transgenic expression of H2A and H2B in a uterine serous carcinoma cell line demonstrated that mutant, but not wild-type, histones increased expression of markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as tumor migratory and invasive properties, suggesting a role in sarcomatous transformation. Comparison of the phylogenetic relationships of carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements of the same tumors demonstrated separate lineages leading to these two components. These findings define the genetic landscape of CSs and suggest therapeutic targets for these highly aggressive neoplasms.",1
27777418,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects around 350 million people worldwide; however, the underlying genetic basis remains largely unknown. In this study, we took into account that MDD is a gene-environment disorder, in which stress is a critical component, and used whole-genome screening of functional variants to investigate the 'missing heritability' in MDD. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using single- and multi-locus linear mixed-effect models were performed in a Los Angeles Mexican-American cohort (196 controls, 203 MDD) and in a replication European-ancestry cohort (499 controls, 473 MDD). Our analyses took into consideration the stress levels in the control populations. The Mexican-American controls, comprised primarily of recent immigrants, had high levels of stress due to acculturation issues and the European-ancestry controls with high stress levels were given higher weights in our analysis. We identified 44 common and rare functional variants associated with mild to moderate MDD in the Mexican-American cohort (genome-wide false discovery rate, FDR, <0.05), and their pathway analysis revealed that the three top overrepresented Gene Ontology (GO) processes were innate immune response, glutamate receptor signaling and detection of chemical stimulus in smell sensory perception. Rare variant analysis replicated the association of the PHF21B gene in the ethnically unrelated European-ancestry cohort. The TRPM2 gene, previously implicated in mood disorders, may also be considered replicated by our analyses. Whole-genome sequencing analyses of a subset of the cohorts revealed that European-ancestry individuals have a significantly reduced (50%) number of single nucleotide variants compared with Mexican-American individuals, and for this reason the role of rare variants may vary across populations. PHF21b variants contribute significantly to differences in the levels of expression of this gene in several brain areas, including the hippocampus. Furthermore, using an animal model of stress, we found that Phf21b hippocampal gene expression is significantly decreased in animals resilient to chronic restraint stress when compared with non-chronically stressed animals. Together, our results reveal that including stress level data enables the identification of novel rare functional variants associated with MDD.",1
27771292,"Over the past three decades, extensive research has been able to determine the biologic functions for the main bioactive sphingolipids, namely ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) (Hannun, 1996; Hannun et al., 1986; Okazaki et al., 1989). These studies have managed to define the metabolism, regulation, and function of these bioactive sphingolipids. This emerging body of literature has also implicated bioactive sphingolipids, particularly S1P and ceramide, as key regulators of cellular homeostasis. Ceramidases have the important role of cleaving fatty acid from ceramide and producing sphingosine, thereby controlling the interconversion of these two lipids. Thus far, five human ceramidases encoded by five different genes have been identified: acid ceramidase (AC), neutral ceramidase (NC), alkaline ceramidase 1 (ACER1), alkaline ceramidase 2 (ACER2), and alkaline ceramidase 3 (ACER3). These ceramidases are classified according to their optimal pH for catalytic activity. AC, which is localized to the lysosomal compartment, has been associated with Farber's disease and is involved in the regulation of cell viability. Neutral ceramidase, which is localized to the plasma membrane and primarily expressed in the small intestine and colon, is involved in digestion, and has been implicated in colon carcinogenesis. ACER1 which can be found in the endoplasmic reticulum and is highly expressed in the skin, plays an important role in keratinocyte differentiation. ACER2, localized to the Golgi complex and highly expressed in the placenta, is involved in programed cell death in response to DNA damage. ACER3, also localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex, is ubiquitously expressed, and is involved in motor coordination-associated Purkinje cell degeneration. This review seeks to consolidate the current knowledge regarding these key cellular players.",1
27766264,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are one of the largest families of membrane-bound proteins and transport a wide variety of substrates across both extra- and intracellular membranes. They play a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. To date, four ABC transporters belonging to subfamily D have been identified. ABCD1-3 and ABCD4 are localized to peroxisomes and lysosomes, respectively. ABCD1 and ABCD2 are involved in the transport of long and very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) or their CoA-derivatives into peroxisomes with different substrate specificities, while ABCD3 is involved in the transport of branched chain acyl-CoA into peroxisomes. On the other hand, ABCD4 is deduced to take part in the transport of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> from lysosomes into the cytosol. It is well known that the dysfunction of ABCD1 results in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, a severe neurodegenerative disease. Recently, it is reported that ABCD3 and ABCD4 are responsible for hepatosplenomegaly and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, respectively. In this review, the targeting mechanism and physiological functions of the ABCD transporters are summarized along with the related disease.",1
27760137,"Autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADTLE) is a focal epilepsy syndrome caused by mutations in the LGI1 gene, which encodes a secreted protein. Most ADLTE-causing mutations inhibit LGI1 protein secretion, and only a few secretion-positive missense mutations have been reported. Here we describe the effects of four disease-causing nonsynonymous LGI1 mutations, T380A, R407C, S473L, and R474Q, on protein secretion and extracellular interactions. Expression of LGI1 mutant proteins in cultured cells shows that these mutations do not inhibit protein secretion. This finding likely results from the lack of effects of these mutations on LGI1 protein folding, as suggested by 3D protein modelling. In addition, immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that all four mutations significantly impair interaction of LGI1 with the ADAM22 and ADAM23 receptors on the cell surface. These results support the existence of a second mechanism, alternative to inhibition of protein secretion, by which ADLTE-causing LGI1 mutations exert their loss-of-function effect extracellularly, and suggest that interactions of LGI1 with both ADAM22 and ADAM23 play an important role in the molecular mechanisms leading to ADLTE.",1

27717669,"Physiological functioning of the brain requires fine-tuned synaptic transmission, and its dysfunction causes various brain disorders such as autism, dementia, and epilepsy. It is therefore extremely important to identify and characterize key regulators of synaptic function. In particular, disease-related synaptic proteins, such as autism-related neurexin-neuroligin and psychiatric disorder-related NMDA receptor, have attracted considerable attention. Recent basic and clinical research has highlighted critical roles of a ligand-receptor complex, LGI1-ADAM22, in synaptic transmission and brain function, as mutations in the LGI1 gene cause autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy and autoantibodies to LGI1 cause limbic encephalitis which is characterized by memory loss and seizures. Here, we will review our current knowledge about LGI1 and ADAM22, and discuss their patho-physiological roles in synaptic transmission and synaptic disorders.",1
27692106,"Familial predisposition is among the major genetic risk factors for non-contact musculoskeletal tissue injuries. Personal genome sequence shows that different polymorphism profiles may account for the number and the degree of injuries and the recovery time. Genotyping studies allow investigation into genome factors with potential impact on pathogenesis of non-contact ligament injuries. We have studied a family with twin sibling males surgically diagnosed of an anterior cruciate ligament non-contact rupture and non-affected progenitors (father and mother) were subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis. WES analysis previously carried out on 16 individuals, without ACL injury medical records, were also included in this study for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions detection (indels), variant filtering and to prioritize variants relative to the disease. WES analysis to identify SNVs and indels was performed using open web-based bioinformatics tools. A set of 11 new variants shared by family members can be associated to ACL non-contact injury, including SerpinA11, ARSI, NOCHT4, EPB41, FDFT1, POMC, KIF26A, OLFML2B, ATG7, FAH and WDR6. All of them, except ATG7 and WDR6, have shown a damaging predictive pattern by combinatorial standard predictive scores. In combination to the identified SNVs of EPB41 and SerpinA11 genes, ACTL7A gene showed a predicted deleterious variant reinforcing the idea these variants impact on of fibroblast-like cells deformability and ECM misbalance, Differential gene expression and RNA sequencing analysis will help to understand the combined participation of these protein coding genes in ACL non-contact injuries.",1
27686078,"The development of ischemic stroke is associated with advanced age. Telomere length, as a marker of biological aging, has been reported to influence the risk of several age-related diseases, including ischemic stroke. Recent studies have identified the genetic variant within ACYP2 and TSPYL6 associated with shorter telomere length. The objective of this study is to investigate the putative association of ischemic stroke with common polymorphisms in ACYP2 and TSPYL6 genes in a Chinese Han population. We found that the risk alleles of six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs11125529, rs12615793, rs843711, rs11896604, and rs843706 within both ACYP2 and TSPYL6, and rs17045754 in ACYP2 gene, were related with increased risk of ischemic stroke according to both allelic and genotype association analyses. The significant correlations between ACYP2 and TSPYL6 SNPs and ischemic stroke risk were also observed in dominant, recessive, and additive models, respectively. Two blocks in high linkage disequilibrium were identified in this study, and two haplotypes were associated with higher ischemic stroke susceptibility. In conclusion, the genetic polymorphisms of ACYP2 and TSPYL6 are associated with increased risk of developing ischemic stroke. Further studies with larger sample sizes are required to validate our findings.",1
27664236,"Increased lipid synthesis is a key characteristic of many cancers that is critical for cancer progression. ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), a key enzyme for lipid synthesis, is frequently overexpressed or activated in cancer to promote lipid synthesis and tumor progression. Cullin3 (CUL3), a core protein for the CUL3-RING ubiquitin ligase complex, has been reported to be a tumor suppressor and frequently down-regulated in lung cancer. Here, we found that CUL3 interacts with ACLY through its adaptor protein, KLHL25 (Kelch-like family member 25), to ubiquitinate and degrade ACLY in cells. Through negative regulation of ACLY, CUL3 inhibits lipid synthesis, cell proliferation, and xenograft tumor growth of lung cancer cells. Furthermore, ACLY inhibitor SB-204990 greatly abolishes the promoting effect of CUL3 down-regulation on lipid synthesis, cell proliferation, and tumor growth. Importantly, low CUL3 expression is associated with high ACLY expression and poor prognosis in human lung cancer. In summary, our results identify CUL3-KLHL25 ubiquitin ligase as a novel negative regulator for ACLY and lipid synthesis and demonstrate that decreased CUL3 expression is an important mechanism for increased ACLY expression and lipid synthesis in lung cancer. These results also reveal that negative regulation of ACLY and lipid synthesis is a novel and critical mechanism for CUL3 in tumor suppression.",1

27625340,"Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome (BWCFF) (BRWS; MIM #243310, 614583) is a rare developmental disorder affecting multiple organ systems. It is characterised by intellectual disability (mild to severe) and distinctive facial appearance (metopic ridging/trigonocephaly, bilateral ptosis, hypertelorism). The additional presence of cortical malformations (pachygyria/lissencephaly) and ocular colobomata are also suggestive of this syndrome. Other features include moderate short stature, contractures, congenital cardiac disease and genitourinary malformations. BWCFF is caused by missense mutations in the cytoplasmic beta- and gamma-actin genes ACTB and ACTG1.

27623284,"Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a complex disease and is one of the major leading causes of blindness worldwide. Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified several common variants associated with glaucoma; however, most of these variants only explain a small proportion of the genetic risk. Apart from the standard approach to identify main effects of variants across the genome, it is believed that gene-gene interactions can help elucidate part of the missing heritability by allowing for the test of interactions between genetic variants to mimic the complex nature of biology. To explain the etiology of glaucoma, we first performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on glaucoma case-control samples obtained from electronic medical records (EMR) to establish the utility of EMR data in detecting non-spurious and relevant associations; this analysis was aimed at confirming already known associations with glaucoma and validating the EMR derived glaucoma phenotype. Our findings from GWAS suggest consistent evidence of several known associations in POAG. We then performed an interaction analysis for variants found to be marginally associated with glaucoma (SNPs with main effect p-value <0.01) and observed interesting findings in the electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics Network (eMERGE) network dataset. Genes from the top epistatic interactions from eMERGE data (Likelihood Ratio Test i.e. LRT p-value <1e-05) were then tested for replication in the NEIGHBOR consortium dataset. To replicate our findings, we performed a gene-based SNP-SNP interaction analysis in NEIGHBOR and observed significant gene-gene interactions (p-value <0.001) among the top 17 gene-gene models identified in the discovery phase. Variants from gene-gene interaction analysis that we found to be associated with POAG explain 3.5% of additional genetic variance in eMERGE dataset above what is explained by the SNPs in genes that are replicated from previous GWAS studies (which was only 2.1% variance explained in eMERGE dataset); in the NEIGHBOR dataset, adding replicated SNPs from gene-gene interaction analysis explain 3.4% of total variance whereas GWAS SNPs alone explain only 2.8% of variance. Exploring gene-gene interactions may provide additional insights into many complex traits when explored in properly designed and powered association studies.",1
27577411,"Since the introduction of diagnosis-related groups in the German healthcare system, classifying patient diagnosis and procedures with controlled vocabularies have become mandatory and thus creating a large dataset for secondary use in biomedical research.

27571068,"The A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 9 (ADAM9) protein has been suggested to promote carcinoma invasion and appears to be overexpressed in various human cancers. However, its role has rarely been investigated in gliomas and, thus, in the current study we have evaluated ADAM9 expression in gliomas and examined the relevance of its expression in the prognosis of glioma patients. Clinical characteristics, RNA sequence data, and the case follow-ups were reviewed for 303 patients who had histological, confirmed gliomas. The ADAM9 expression between lower-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma (GBM) patients was compared and its association with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed to evaluate its prognostic value. Our data suggested that GBM patients had significantly higher expression of ADAM9 in comparison to LGG patients (p < 0.001, t-test). In addition, among the LGG patients, aggressive astrocytic tumors displayed significantly higher ADAM9 expression than oligodendroglial tumors (p < 0.001, t-test). Moreover, high ADAM9 expression also correlated with poor clinical outcome (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, log-rank test, for PFS and OS, respectively) in LGG patients. Further, multivariate analysis suggested ADAM9 expression to be an independent marker of poor survival (p = 0.002 and p = 0.003, for PFS and OS, respectively). These results suggest that ADAM9 mRNA expression is associated with tumor grade and histological type in gliomas and can serve as an independent prognostic factor, specifically in LGG patients.",1
27568525,"Elucidating the poorly defined mechanisms by which inflammatory lesions are spatially restricted in vivo is of critical importance in understanding skin disease. Chemokines are the principal regulators of leukocyte migration and are essential in the initiation and maintenance of inflammation. The membrane-bound psoriasis-associated atypical chemokine receptor 2 (ACKR2) binds, internalizes and degrades most proinflammatory CC-chemokines. Here we investigate the role of ACKR2 in limiting the spread of cutaneous psoriasiform inflammation to sites that are remote from the primary lesion. Circulating factors capable of regulating ACKR2 function at remote sites were identified and examined using a combination of clinical samples, relevant primary human cell cultures, in vitro migration assays, and the imiquimod-induced model of psoriasiform skin inflammation. Localized inflammation and IFN-γ together up-regulate ACKR2 in remote tissues, protecting them from the spread of inflammation. ACKR2 controls inflammatory T-cell chemotaxis and positioning within the skin, preventing an epidermal influx that is associated with lesion development. Our results have important implications for our understanding of how spatial restriction is imposed on the spread of inflammatory lesions and highlight systemic ACKR2 induction as a therapeutic strategy in the treatment and prevention of psoriasis and potentially a broad range of other immune-mediated diseases.",1
27545680,"The overall understanding of the molecular etiologies of intellectual disability (ID) and developmental delay (DD) is increasing as next-generation sequencing technologies identify genetic variants in individuals with such disorders. However, detailed analyses conclusively confirming these variants, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms explaining the diseases, are often lacking. Here, we report on an ID syndrome caused by de novo heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in SON. The syndrome is characterized by ID and/or DD, malformations of the cerebral cortex, epilepsy, vision problems, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and congenital malformations. Knockdown of son in zebrafish resulted in severe malformation of the spine, brain, and eyes. Importantly, analyses of RNA from affected individuals revealed that genes critical for neuronal migration and cortex organization (TUBG1, FLNA, PNKP, WDR62, PSMD3, and HDAC6) and metabolism (PCK2, PFKL, IDH2, ACY1, and ADA) are significantly downregulated because of the accumulation of mis-spliced transcripts resulting from erroneous SON-mediated RNA splicing. Our data highlight SON as a master regulator governing neurodevelopment and demonstrate the importance of SON-mediated RNA splicing in human development.",1
27545300,"Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) is a chronic osteoarthropathy, which manifests as joint deformities and growth retardation. Only a few genetic studies of growth retardation associated with the KBD have been carried out by now. In this study, we conducted a two-stage bivariate genome-wide association study (BGWAS) of the KBD using joint deformities and body height as study phenotypes, totally involving 2,417 study subjects. Articular cartilage specimens from 8 subjects were collected for immunohistochemistry. In the BGWAS, ADAM12 gene achieved the most significant association (rs1278300 p-value = 9.25 × 10(-9)) with the KBD. Replication study observed significant association signal at rs1278300 (p-value = 0.007) and rs1710287 (p-value = 0.002) of ADAM12 after Bonferroni correction. Immunohistochemistry revealed significantly decreased expression level of ADAM12 protein in the KBD articular cartilage (average positive chondrocyte rate = 47.59 ± 7.79%) compared to healthy articular cartilage (average positive chondrocyte rate = 64.73 ± 5.05%). Our results suggest that ADAM12 gene is a novel susceptibility gene underlying both joint destruction and growth retardation of the KBD.",1
27542224,"A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) family is involved in tumor development. However, how ADAMTS6 influences cancer remains unknown. We investigated the biological function and clinical implications of ADAMTs6 in breast cancer (BC). Its functional significance in BC cell lines was confirmed by ADAMTs6 overexpression or downregulation both in vitro and in vivo studies. Enhanced ADAMTS6 expression suppressed cell migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis, whereas knockdown promoted these characteristics. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway was partially involved in ADAMTS6-mediated inhibition of BC development, and miR-221-3p was identified as a predicted target for ADAMTS6. Results from the luciferase assay confirmed that miR-221-3p directly inhibited ADAMTS6 expression by binding its 3'-untranslated region. In addition, immunohistochemistry data from specimens from 182 BC patients showed that high ADAMTS6 expression was significantly correlated with favorable disease-free survival (DFS, p = 0.045). Subgroup analysis of patients with ER positive, PR positive or HER-2 negative tumors revealed that high ADAMTS6 expression more strongly extended DFS compared to low expression (p = 0.004, p = 0.009, p = 0.017). Multivariate analyses confirmed that ADAMTS6 expression was an independent risk factor for DFS (p = 0.011). Together, these data demonstrate that ADAMTS6 inhibits tumor development by regulating the ERK pathway via binding of miR-221-3p. Thus, its expression may be a potential prognostic biomarker for BC.",1
27539004,"PM<sub>2.5</sub> travels along the respiratory tract and enters systemic blood circulation. Studies have shown that PM<sub>2.5</sub> increases the incidence of various diseases not only in adults but also in newborn infants. It causes chronic inflammation in pregnant women and retards fetal development. In this study, pregnant rats were exposed to PM<sub>2.5</sub> for extended periods of time and it was found that PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure increased immune cells in mother rats. In addition, cytokines and free radicals rapidly accumulated in the amniotic fluid and indirectly affected the fetuses. The authors collected cerebral cortex and hippocampus samples at E18 and analyzed changes of miRNA levels. Expression levels of cortical miR-6315, miR-3588, and miR-466b-5p were upregulated, and positively correlated with the genes Pkn2 (astrocyte migration), Gorab (neuritogenesis), and Mobp (allergic encephalomyelitis). In contrast, PM<sub>2.5</sub> decreased expression of miR-338-5p and let-7e-5p, both related to mental development. Further, PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure increased miR-3560 and let-7b-5p in the hippocampus, two proteins that regulate genes Oxct1 and Lin28b that control ketogenesis and glycosylation, and neural cell differentiation, respectively. miR-99b-5p, miR-92b-5p, and miR-99a-5p were decreased, leading to reduced expression of Kbtbd8 and Adam11 which reduced cell mitosis, migration, and differentiation, and inhibited learning abilities and motor coordination of the fetus. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

27529621,"Stressful events have been identified as a risk factor for depression. Although gene-environment (G × E) interaction in a limited number of candidate genes has been explored, no genome-wide search has been reported. The aim of the present study is to identify genes that influence the association of stressful events with depression. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide G × E interaction analysis in the Japanese population. A genome-wide screen with 320 subjects was performed using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human Array 6.0. Stressful life events were assessed using the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) and depression symptoms were assessed with self-rating questionnaires using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale. The p values for interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and stressful events were calculated using the linear regression model adjusted for sex and age. After quality control of genotype data, a total of 534,848 SNPs on autosomal chromosomes were further analyzed. Although none surpassed the level of the genome-wide significance, a marginal significant association of interaction between SRRS and rs10510057 with depression were found (p = 4.5 × 10-8). The SNP is located on 10q26 near Regulators of G-protein signaling 10 (RGS10), which encodes a regulatory molecule involved in stress response. When we investigated a similar G × E interaction between depression (K6 scale) and work-related stress in an independent sample (n = 439), a significant G × E effect on depression was observed (p = 0.015). Our findings suggest that rs10510057, interacting with stressors, may be involved in depression risk. Incorporating G × E interaction into GWAS can contribute to find susceptibility locus that are potentially missed by conventional GWAS.",1
27503288,"Primary Sjögren's syndrome (PSS) is an autoimmune disease targeting exocrine glands. It ten times more dominantly affects women than men with an onset peak at menopause. The genetic factor predisposing women to PSS remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to identify susceptibility loci for PSS in women. We performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 242 female PSS patients and 1444 female control in Han Chinese population residing in Taiwan. Replication was conducted in an independent cohort of 178 female PSS and 14,432 control subjects. We identified rs117026326 on GTF2I with GWAS significance (P = 1.10 × 10<sup>-15</sup>) and rs13079920 on RBMS3 with suggestive significance (P = 2.90 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) associating with PSS in women. The association of RBMS3 was further evidenced by imputation in which rs13072846 (P = 4.89 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) was identified and confirmed as female PSS associating SNP within the same LD with rs13079920. PSS pathogenesis involves both immune (effector) and exocrine (target) system. We suggested that while GTF2I is a previously reported associating gene which may function in immune system, RBMS3 is a novel susceptibility gene that predisposes women to PSS potentially through modulating acinar apoptosis and TGF-β signaling in target exocrine system.",1
27500523,"Metformin is the first-line antidiabetic drug with over 100 million users worldwide, yet its mechanism of action remains unclear. Here the Metformin Genetics (MetGen) Consortium reports a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS), consisting of 13,123 participants of different ancestries. The C allele of rs8192675 in the intron of SLC2A2, which encodes the facilitated glucose transporter GLUT2, was associated with a 0.17% (P = 6.6 × 10(-14)) greater metformin-induced reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in 10,577 participants of European ancestry. rs8192675 was the top cis expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) for SLC2A2 in 1,226 human liver samples, suggesting a key role for hepatic GLUT2 in regulation of metformin action. Among obese individuals, C-allele homozygotes at rs8192675 had a 0.33% (3.6 mmol/mol) greater absolute HbA1c reduction than T-allele homozygotes. This was about half the effect seen with the addition of a DPP-4 inhibitor, and equated to a dose difference of 550 mg of metformin, suggesting rs8192675 as a potential biomarker for stratified medicine.",1
27492611,"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare and devastating genetic disease of heterotopic endochondral ossification (HEO), and currently no effective therapies are available for this disease. A recurrent causative heterozygous mutation (c.617 G>A; R206H) for FOP was identified in activin receptor type IA (ACVR1), a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor. This mutation aberrantly activates the BMP-Smad1/5/8 signaling pathway and leads to HEO in FOP patients. Here we report development of a soluble recombinant ACVR1-Fc fusion protein by combining the extracellular domain of human wild type ACVR1 and the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1). The ACVR1-Fc fusion protein significantly down-regulated the dysregulated BMP signaling caused by the FOP ACVR1 mutation and effectively suppressed chondro-osseous differentiation in a previously described cellular FOP model, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that were infected with adenovirus-ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> (HUVEC<sup>R206H</sup>). This ACVR1-Fc fusion protein holds great promise for prevention and treatment of HEO in FOP and related diseases.",1
27480026,"Hypertension is a major global health burden and a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Although its heritability has been documented previously, contributing loci identified to date account for only a small fraction of blood pressure (BP) variation, which strongly suggests the existence of undiscovered variants. To identify novel variants, we conducted a three staged genetic study in 21,990 hypertensive cases and normotensive controls. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at three new genes (L3MBTL4 rs403814, Pmeta = 6.128 × 10(-9); LOC729251, and TCEANC) and seven SNPs at five previously reported genes were identified as being significantly associated with hypertension. Through functional analysis, we found that L3MBTL4 is predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and up-regulated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Rats with ubiquitous over-expression of L3MBTL4 exhibited significantly elevated BP, increased thickness of the vascular media layer and cardiac hypertrophy. Mechanistically, L3MBTL4 over-expression could lead to down-regulation of latent transforming growth factor-β binding protein 1 (LTBP1), and phosphorylation activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway, which is known to trigger the pathological progression of vascular remodeling and BP elevation. These findings pinpointed L3MBTL4 as a critical contributor to the development and progression of hypertension and uncovers a novel target for therapeutic intervention.",1
27461219,"African Americans (AAs) are at higher risk for developing end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) compared to European Americans. Genome-wide association studies have identified variants associated with diabetic and non-diabetic kidney diseases. Nephropathy loci, including SLC7A9, UMOD, and SHROOM3, have been implicated in the maintenance of normal glomerular and renal tubular structure and function. Herein, 47 genes important in podocyte, glomerular basement membrane, mesangial cell, mesangial matrix, renal tubular cell, and renal interstitium structure were examined for association with type 2 diabetes (T2D)-attributed ESKD in AAs. Single-variant association analysis was performed in the discovery stage, including 2041 T2D-ESKD cases and 1140 controls (non-diabetic, non-nephropathy). Discrimination analyses in 667 T2D cases-lacking nephropathy excluded T2D-associated SNPs. Nominal associations were tested in an additional 483 T2D-ESKD cases and 554 controls in the replication stage. Meta-analysis of 4218 discovery and replication samples revealed three significant associations with T2D-ESKD at CD2AP and MMP2 (P <sub>corr</sub> < 0.05 corrected for effective number of SNPs in each locus). Removal of APOL1 renal-risk genotype carriers revealed additional association at five loci, TTC21B, COL4A3, NPHP3-ACAD11, CLDN8, and ARHGAP24 (P <sub>corr</sub> < 0.05). Genetic variants at COL4A3, CLDN8, and ARHGAP24 were potentially pathogenic. Gene-based associations revealed suggestive significant aggregate effects of coding variants at four genes. Our findings suggest that genetic variation in kidney structure-related genes may contribute to T2D-attributed ESKD in the AA population.",1
27454492,"The purpose of the study was to determine the changes in knowledge of information technology (IT) professionals after receiving a nutrition education intervention for a month. The sample comprised of 40 IT professionals (29 males and 11 females). The sample was drawn from four IT companies of Hyderabad city using random sampling techniques. The data on the general information of the subjects was collected. The data regarding the commonly accessed sources of nutrition and health information by the subjects was also obtained from the study. The intervention study group received nutrition education by distribution of the developed CD-ROMs to them followed by interactive sessions. To assess the impact of nutrition education intervention, the knowledge assessment questionnaire (KAQ) was developed and administered before and after the education programme. A significant improvement in the mean nutritional knowledge scores was observed among the total study subjects from 22.30 to 40.55 after the intervention (p < 0.05). The findings support the importance of providing professionals with nutrition knowledge to promote healthy dietary behaviors.Thus, the method of e-learning and development of CD-Rom is essential for teaching the educated groups on nutrition, physical activity and overall health education to improve their health, lifestyle and eating habits.",0
27424934,"To identify genetic variants that influence bone mineral density (BMD) in East Asians, we performed a quantitative trait analysis of lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD in a Korean population-based cohort (N=2729) and follow-up replication analysis in a Chinese Han population and two Caucasian populations (N=1547, 2250 and 987, respectively). From the meta-analysis of the stage 1 discovery analysis and stage 2 replication analysis, we identified four BMD loci that reached near-genome-wide significance level (P<5×10(-7)). One locus on 1q23 (UHMK1, rs16863247, P=4.1×10(-7) for femoral neck BMD and P=3.2×10(-6) for total hip BMD) was a novel BMD signal. Interestingly, rs16863247 was very rare in Caucasians (minor allele frequency<0.01), indicating that this association could be specific to East Asians. In gender specific analysis, rs1160574 on 1q32 (KCNH1) was associated with femoral neck BMD (P=2.1×10(-7)) in female subjects. rs9371538 in the known BMD region on 6q25 ESR1 was associated with lumbar spine BMD (P=5.6×10(-9)). rs7776725 in the known BMD region on 7q31 WTN16 was associated with total hip BMD (P=8.6×10(-9)). In osteoblasts, endogenous UHMK1 expression was increased during differentiation and UHMK1 knockdown decreased its differentiation, while UHMK1 overexpression increased its differentiation. In osteoclasts, endogenous UHMK1 expression was decreased during differentiation and UHMK1 knockdown increased its differentiation, while UHMK1 overexpression decreased its differentiation. In conclusion, our genome-wide association study identified the UHMK1 gene as a novel BMD locus specific to East Asians. Functional studies suggest a role of UHMK1 on regulation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts.",1

However, much of the evidence for vitamin supplementation in pregnancy comes from studies carried out in low-income countries,(3) where women are more likely to be undernourished or malnourished than within the UK population. The challenges lie in knowing which supplements are beneficial and in improving uptake among those at most need. Here we summarise current UK guidance for vitamin supplementation in pregnancy and review the evidence behind it.",0
27404257,"Apoptosis is a form of active cell death engaged by developmental cues as well as many different cellular stresses in which the dying cell essentially 'packages' itself for removal. The process of apoptotic cell death, as defined at the molecular level, is unique to the Metazoa (animals). Yet active cell death exists in non-animal organisms, and in some cases molecules involved in such death show some sequence similarities to those involved in apoptosis, leading to extensive speculation regarding the evolution of apoptosis. Here, we examine such speculation from the perspective of the functional properties of molecules of the mitochondrial apoptotic cell death pathway. We suggest scenarios for the evolution of one pathway of apoptosis, the mitochondrial pathway, and consider how they might be tested. We conclude with a 'Just So Story' of how the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis might have evolved during eukaryotic evolution.",1
27392606,"The remarkable capacity of some viruses to adapt to new hosts and environments is highly dependent on their ability to generate de novo diversity in a short period of time. Rates of spontaneous mutation vary amply among viruses. RNA viruses mutate faster than DNA viruses, single-stranded viruses mutate faster than double-strand virus, and genome size appears to correlate negatively with mutation rate. Viral mutation rates are modulated at different levels, including polymerase fidelity, sequence context, template secondary structure, cellular microenvironment, replication mechanisms, proofreading, and access to post-replicative repair. Additionally, massive numbers of mutations can be introduced by some virus-encoded diversity-generating elements, as well as by host-encoded cytidine/adenine deaminases. Our current knowledge of viral mutation rates indicates that viral genetic diversity is determined by multiple virus- and host-dependent processes, and that viral mutation rates can evolve in response to specific selective pressures.",0

27378695,"Rare and low frequency variants are not well covered in most germline genotyping arrays and are understudied in relation to epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) risk. To address this gap, we used genotyping arrays targeting rarer protein-coding variation in 8,165 EOC cases and 11,619 controls from the international Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC). Pooled association analyses were conducted at the variant and gene level for 98,543 variants directly genotyped through two exome genotyping projects. Only common variants that represent or are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with previously-identified signals at established loci reached traditional thresholds for exome-wide significance (P < 5.0 × 10 <sup>-</sup>  <sup>7</sup>). One of the most significant signals (P<sub>all histologies </sub>=<sub> </sub>1.01 × 10 <sup>-</sup>  <sup>13</sup>;P<sub>serous </sub>=<sub> </sub>3.54 × 10 <sup>-</sup>  <sup>14</sup>) occurred at 3q25.31 for rs62273959, a missense variant mapping to the LEKR1 gene that is in LD (r<sup>2 </sup>=<sup> </sup>0.90) with a previously identified 'best hit' (rs7651446) mapping to an intron of TIPARP. Suggestive associations (5.0 × 10 <sup>-</sup>  <sup>5 </sup>><sup> </sup>P≥5.0 ×10 <sup>-</sup>  <sup>7</sup>) were detected for rare and low-frequency variants at 16 novel loci. Four rare missense variants were identified (ACTBL2 rs73757391 (5q11.2), BTD rs200337373 (3p25.1), KRT13 rs150321809 (17q21.2) and MC2R rs104894658 (18p11.21)), but only MC2R rs104894668 had a large effect size (OR = 9.66). Genes most strongly associated with EOC risk included ACTBL2 (P<sub>AML </sub>=<sub> </sub>3.23 × 10 <sup>-</sup>  <sup>5</sup>; P<sub>SKAT-o </sub>=<sub> </sub>9.23 × 10 <sup>-</sup>  <sup>4</sup>) and KRT13 (P<sub>AML </sub>=<sub> </sub>1.67 × 10 <sup>-</sup>  <sup>4</sup>; P<sub>SKAT-o </sub>=<sub> </sub>1.07 × 10 <sup>-</sup>  <sup>5</sup>), reaffirming variant-level analysis.

27369867,"Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and other lymphomas derived from follicular T-helper cells (TFH) represent a large proportion of peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) with poorly understood pathogenesis and unfavorable treatment results. We investigated a series of 85 patients with AITL (n = 72) or other TFH-derived PTCL (n = 13) by targeted deep sequencing of a gene panel enriched in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling elements. RHOA mutations were identified in 51 of 85 cases (60%) consisting of the highly recurrent dominant negative G17V variant in most cases and a novel K18N in 3 cases, the latter showing activating properties in in vitro assays. Moreover, half of the patients carried virtually mutually exclusive mutations in other TCR-related genes, most frequently in PLCG1 (14.1%), CD28 (9.4%, exclusively in AITL), PI3K elements (7%), CTNNB1 (6%), and GTF2I (6%). Using in vitro assays in transfected cells, we demonstrated that 9 of 10 PLCG1 and 3 of 3 CARD11 variants induced MALT1 protease activity and increased transcription from NFAT or NF-κB response element reporters, respectively. Collectively, the vast majority of variants in TCR-related genes could be classified as gain-of-function. Accordingly, the samples with mutations in TCR-related genes other than RHOA had transcriptomic profiles enriched in signatures reflecting higher T-cell activation. Although no correlation with presenting clinical features nor significant impact on survival was observed, the presence of TCR-related mutations correlated with early disease progression. Thus, targeting of TCR-related events may hold promise for the treatment of TFH-derived lymphomas.",1

27363013,"Accumulating evidences indicate that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms remain largely unknown. To explore lncRNAs and circRNAs expression profiling and their biological functions in bladder cancer, we surveyed the lncRNA/circRNA and mRNA expression profiles of bladder cancer and para-cancer tissues using microarray for four patients. Thousands of significantly changed lncRNAs and mRNAs as well as hundreds of circRNAs were identified. Five dysregulated lncRNAs and four mRNAs were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR in 30 pairs of samples. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were executed to determine the principal functions of the significantly deregulated genes. Further more, we constructed correlated expression networks including coding-noncoding co-expression (CNC), competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA), cis regulation, lncRNAs-transcription factor (TF)-mRNA with bioinformatics methods. Co-expression analysis showed lncRNA APLP2 expression is correlated with apoptosis-related genes, including PTEN and TP53INP1. CeRNA network inferred that lncRNA H19 and circRNA MYLK could bind competitively with miRNA-29a-3p increasing target gene DNMT3B, VEGFA and ITGB1 expressions. Moreover, the nearby genes pattern displayed that overexpressing ADAM2 and C8orf4 are cis-regulated by lncRNA RP11-359E19.2, involving in progression of bladder cancer. In addition, lncRNAs-TF-mRNA diagram indicated that lncRNA BC041488 could trans-regulate CDK1 mRNA expression through SRF transcription factor. Taken together, these results suggested lncRNAs and circRNAs could implicate in the pathogenesis and development of bladder cancer. Our findings provide a novel perspective on lncRNAs and circRNAs and lay the foundation for future research of potential roles of lncRNAs and circRNAs in bladder carcinoma.",1
27359055,"We selected 19 significantly-mutated genes in AMLs, including FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, RUNX1, CEBPA, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, NRAS, ASXL1, SETD2, PTPN11, TP53, KIT, JAK2, KRAS, BRAF and CBL, and performed massively parallel sequencing for 114 patients with acute myeloid leukemias, mainly including those with normal karyotypes (CN-AML). More than 80% of patients had at least one mutation in the genes tested.

The enzymatic and physiological characterization of the human xenobiotic/medium chain fatty acid: CoA ligases (ACSMs) has been severely neglected even though xenobiotics, such as benzoate and salicylate, are detoxified through this pathway.",1
27350560,"Homelessness is present in most societies and represents a situation in which the basic needs for survival including food are often limited. It is logical to surmise that the homeless person's diet is likely to be nutritionally deficient and yet there is a relative paucity in research regarding this issue with studies varying in both their methodology and homeless population. Despite these differences, diets of the homeless are frequently characterised as high in saturated fat and deficient in fibre and certain micronutrients, all of which can have negative implications for the homeless individual's health and/or mental state. The conclusion from intervention studies is that there is no consensus as to the most effective method for assessing dietary intake. In order to address this, the present review aims to provide a greater understanding of the existing literature surrounding nutrition and the homeless and to act as a foundation from which further research can be conducted. An evaluation of the main findings and challenges surrounding the assessment of the nutritional status of the homeless will be provided followed by a review of the physical and mental consequences of the homeless diet. Current and potential interventions aimed at increasing the nutritional quality of food consumed by the homeless will be addressed with a focus on the role of the nutritional science community in assisting in this endeavour.",0
27333034,"Although several ADAMs (A disintegrin-like and metalloproteases) have been shown to contribute to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, the full spectrum of metalloproteases involved in this metabolism remains to be established. Transcriptomic analyses centred on metalloprotease genes unraveled a 50% decrease in ADAM30 expression that inversely correlates with amyloid load in Alzheimer's disease brains. Accordingly, in vitro down- or up-regulation of ADAM30 expression triggered an increase/decrease in Aβ peptides levels whereas expression of a biologically inactive ADAM30 (ADAM30(mut)) did not affect Aβ secretion. Proteomics/cell-based experiments showed that ADAM30-dependent regulation of APP metabolism required both cathepsin D (CTSD) activation and APP sorting to lysosomes. Accordingly, in Alzheimer-like transgenic mice, neuronal ADAM30 over-expression lowered Aβ42 secretion in neuron primary cultures, soluble Aβ42 and amyloid plaque load levels in the brain and concomitantly enhanced CTSD activity and finally rescued long term potentiation alterations. Our data thus indicate that lowering ADAM30 expression may favor Aβ production, thereby contributing to Alzheimer's disease development.",1
27303034,"Proper biogenesis of a sperm-specific organelle, the acrosome, is essential for gamete interaction. An acrosomal matrix protein, ACRBP, is known as a proacrosin-binding protein. In mice, two forms of ACRBP, wild-type ACRBP-W and variant ACRBP-V5, are generated by pre-mRNA alternative splicing of Acrbp Here, we demonstrate the functional roles of these two ACRBP proteins. ACRBP-null male mice lacking both proteins showed a severely reduced fertility, because of malformation of the acrosome. Notably, ACRBP-null spermatids failed to form a large acrosomal granule, leading to the fragmented structure of the acrosome. The acrosome malformation was rescued by transgenic expression of ACRBP-V5 in ACRBP-null spermatids. Moreover, exogenously expressed ACRBP-W blocked autoactivation of proacrosin in the acrosome. Thus, ACRBP-V5 functions in the formation and configuration of the acrosomal granule during early spermiogenesis. The major function of ACRBP-W is to retain the inactive status of proacrosin in the acrosome until acrosomal exocytosis.",1
27294501,"Prolonged unaccustomed exercise involving muscle lengthening (eccentric) actions can result in ultrastructural muscle disruption, impaired excitation-contraction coupling, inflammation and muscle protein degradation. This process is associated with delayed onset muscle soreness and is referred to as exercise-induced muscle damage. Although a certain amount of muscle damage may be necessary for adaptation to occur, excessive damage or inadequate recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage can increase injury risk, particularly in older individuals, who experience more damage and require longer to recover from muscle damaging exercise than younger adults. Furthermore, it is apparent that inter-individual variation exists in the response to exercise-induced muscle damage, and there is evidence that genetic variability may play a key role. Although this area of research is in its infancy, certain gene variations, or polymorphisms have been associated with exercise-induced muscle damage (i.e. individuals with certain genotypes experience greater muscle damage, and require longer recovery, following strenuous exercise). These polymorphisms include ACTN3 (R577X, rs1815739), TNF (-308 G>A, rs1800629), IL6 (-174 G>C, rs1800795), and IGF2 (ApaI, 17200 G>A, rs680). Knowing how someone is likely to respond to a particular type of exercise could help coaches/practitioners individualise the exercise training of their athletes/patients, thus maximising recovery and adaptation, while reducing overload-associated injury risk. The purpose of this review is to provide a critical analysis of the literature concerning gene polymorphisms associated with exercise-induced muscle damage, both in young and older individuals, and to highlight the potential mechanisms underpinning these associations, thus providing a better understanding of exercise-induced muscle damage.",1
27287556,"α-Actinin-2 (ACTN2) is the only muscle isoform of α-actinin expressed in cardiac muscle. Mutations in this protein have been implicated in mild to moderate forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We have investigated the effects of two mutations identified from HCM patients, A119T and G111V, on the secondary and tertiary structure of a purified actin binding domain (ABD) of ACTN2 by circular dichroism and X-ray crystallography, and show small but distinct changes for both mutations. We also find that both mutants have reduced F-actin binding affinity, although the differences are not significant. The full length mEos2 tagged protein expressed in adult cardiomyocytes shows that both mutations additionally affect Z-disc localization and dynamic behaviour. Overall, these two mutations have small effects on structure, function and behaviour, which may contribute to a mild phenotype for this disease.",1

27281222,"Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) arises after transformation of a haemopoietic stem cell (HSC) by the protein-tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL. Direct inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase has revolutionized disease management, but fails to eradicate leukaemic stem cells (LSCs), which maintain CML. LSCs are independent of BCR-ABL for survival, providing a rationale for identifying and targeting kinase-independent pathways. Here we show--using proteomics, transcriptomics and network analyses--that in human LSCs, aberrantly expressed proteins, in both imatinib-responder and non-responder patients, are modulated in concert with p53 (also known as TP53) and c-MYC regulation. Perturbation of both p53 and c-MYC, and not BCR-ABL itself, leads to synergistic cell kill, differentiation, and near elimination of transplantable human LSCs in mice, while sparing normal HSCs. This unbiased systems approach targeting connected nodes exemplifies a novel precision medicine strategy providing evidence that LSCs can be eradicated.",1
27272014,"We know little about on how frequently transitions into new habitats occur, especially the colonization of novel environments that are the most likely to instigate adaptive evolution. One of the most extreme ecological transitions has been the shift in habitat associated with the move from water to land by amphibious fish. We provide the first phylogenetic investigation of these transitions for living fish. Thirty-three families have species reported to be amphibious and these are likely independent evolutionary origins of fish emerging onto land. Phylogenetic reconstructions of closely related taxa within one of these families, the Blenniidae, inferred as many as seven convergences on a highly amphibious lifestyle. Taken together, there appear to be few constraints on fish emerging onto land given amphibious behavior has evolved repeatedly many times across ecologically diverse families. The colonization of novel habitats by other taxa resulting in less dramatic changes in environment should be equally, if not, more frequent in nature, providing an important prerequisite for subsequent adaptive differentiation.",0
27271629,"Traditional monopulse angle estimations are mainly based on phase comparison and amplitude comparison methods, which are commonly adopted in narrowband radars. In modern radar systems, wideband radars are becoming more and more important, while the angle estimation for wideband signals is little studied in previous works. As noise in wideband radars has larger bandwidth than narrowband radars, the challenge lies in the accumulation of energy from the high resolution range profile (HRRP) of monopulse. In wideband radars, linear frequency modulated (LFM) signals are frequently utilized. In this paper, we investigate the monopulse angle estimation problem for wideband LFM signals. To accumulate the energy of the received echo signals from different scatterers of a target, we propose utilizing a cross-correlation operation, which can achieve a good performance in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In the proposed algorithm, the problem of angle estimation is converted to estimating the frequency of the cross-correlation function (CCF). Experimental results demonstrate the similar performance of the proposed algorithm compared with the traditional amplitude comparison method. It means that the proposed method for angle estimation can be adopted. When adopting the proposed method, future radars may only need wideband signals for both tracking and imaging, which can greatly increase the data rate and strengthen the capability of anti-jamming. More importantly, the estimated angle will not become ambiguous under an arbitrary angle, which can significantly extend the estimated angle range in wideband radars.",0
27271309,"We performed genome-wide analyses to identify genomic loci that interact with sodium to influence blood pressure (BP) using single-marker-based (1 and 2 df joint tests) and gene-based tests among 1876 Chinese participants of the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Salt-Sensitivity (GenSalt) study. Among GenSalt participants, the average of 3 urine samples was used to estimate sodium excretion. Nine BP measurements were taken using a random zero sphygmomanometer. A total of 2.05 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms were imputed using Affymetrix 6.0 genotype data and the Chinese Han of Beijing and Japanese of Tokyo HapMap reference panel. Promising findings (P<1.00×10(-4)) from GenSalt were evaluated for replication among 775 Chinese participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Single-nucleotide polymorphism and gene-based results were meta-analyzed across the GenSalt and MESA studies to determine genome-wide significance. The 1 df tests identified interactions for UST rs13211840 on diastolic BP (P=3.13×10(-9)). The 2 df tests additionally identified associations for CLGN rs2567241 (P=3.90×10(-12)) and LOC105369882 rs11104632 (P=4.51×10(-8)) with systolic BP. The CLGN variant rs2567241 was also associated with diastolic BP (P=3.11×10(-22)) and mean arterial pressure (P=2.86×10(-15)). Genome-wide gene-based analysis identified MKNK1 (P=6.70×10(-7)), C2orf80 (P<1.00×10(-12)), EPHA6 (P=2.88×10(-7)), SCOC-AS1 (P=4.35×10(-14)), SCOC (P=6.46×10(-11)), CLGN (P=3.68×10(-13)), MGAT4D (P=4.73×10(-11)), ARHGAP42 (P≤1.00×10(-12)), CASP4 (P=1.31×10(-8)), and LINC01478 (P=6.75×10(-10)) that were associated with at least 1 BP phenotype. In summary, we identified 8 novel and 1 previously reported BP loci through the examination of single-nucleotide polymorphism and gene-based interactions with sodium.",1
27270174,"Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a devastating eye disease and an important cause of childhood blindness worldwide. In PCG, defects in the anterior chamber aqueous humor outflow structures of the eye result in elevated intraocular pressure (IOP); however, the genes and molecular mechanisms involved in the etiology of these defects have not been fully characterized. Previously, we observed PCG-like phenotypes in transgenic mice that lack functional angiopoietin-TEK signaling. Herein, we identified rare TEK variants in 10 of 189 unrelated PCG families and demonstrated that each mutation results in haploinsufficiency due to protein loss of function. Multiple cellular mechanisms were responsible for the loss of protein function resulting from individual TEK variants, including an absence of normal protein production, protein aggregate formation, enhanced proteasomal degradation, altered subcellular localization, and reduced responsiveness to ligand stimulation. Further, in mice, hemizygosity for Tek led to the formation of severely hypomorphic Schlemm's canal and trabecular meshwork, as well as elevated IOP, demonstrating that anterior chamber vascular development is sensitive to Tek gene dosage and the resulting decrease in angiopoietin-TEK signaling. Collectively, these results identify TEK mutations in patients with PCG that likely underlie disease and are transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern with variable expressivity.",1
27259050,"Ataxia-pancytopenia (AP) syndrome is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, variable hematologic cytopenias, and predisposition to marrow failure and myeloid leukemia, sometimes associated with monosomy 7. Here, in the four-generation family UW-AP, linkage analysis revealed four regions that provided the maximal LOD scores possible, one of which was in a commonly microdeleted chromosome 7q region. Exome sequencing identified a missense mutation (c.2640C>A, p.His880Gln) in the sterile alpha motif domain containing 9-like gene (SAMD9L) that completely cosegregated with disease. By targeted sequencing of SAMD9L, we subsequently identified a different missense mutation (c.3587G>C, p.Cys1196Ser) in affected members of the first described family with AP syndrome, Li-AP. Neither variant is reported in the public databases, both affect highly conserved amino acid residues, and both are predicted to be damaging. With time in culture, lymphoblastic cell lines (LCLs) from two affected individuals in family UW-AP exhibited copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity for large portions of the long arm of chromosome 7, resulting in retention of only the wild-type SAMD9L allele. Newly established LCLs from both individuals demonstrated the same phenomenon. In addition, targeted capture and sequencing of SAMD9L in uncultured blood DNA from both individuals showed bias toward the wild-type allele. These observations indicate in vivo hematopoietic mosaicism. The hematopoietic cytopenias that characterize AP syndrome and the selective advantage for clones that have lost the mutant allele support the postulated role of SAMD9L in the regulation of cell proliferation. Furthermore, we show that AP syndrome is distinct from the dyskeratoses congenita telomeropathies, with which it shares some clinical characteristics.",1
27245242,"The WNT signaling pathway has an essential role in colorectal carcinogenesis and progression, which involves a cascade of genetic and epigenetic changes. We aimed to analyze DNA methylation affecting the WNT pathway genes in colorectal carcinogenesis in promoter and gene body regions using whole methylome analysis in 9 colorectal cancer, 15 adenoma, and 6 normal tumor adjacent tissue (NAT) samples by methyl capture sequencing. Functional methylation was confirmed on 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine-treated colorectal cancer cell line datasets. In parallel with the DNA methylation analysis, mutations of WNT pathway genes (APC, β-catenin/CTNNB1) were analyzed by 454 sequencing on GS Junior platform. Most differentially methylated CpG sites were localized in gene body regions (95% of WNT pathway genes). In the promoter regions, 33 of the 160 analyzed WNT pathway genes were differentially methylated in colorectal cancer vs. normal, including hypermethylated AXIN2, CHP1, PRICKLE1, SFRP1, SFRP2, SOX17, and hypomethylated CACYBP, CTNNB1, MYC; 44 genes in adenoma vs. NAT; and 41 genes in colorectal cancer vs. adenoma comparisons. Hypermethylation of AXIN2, DKK1, VANGL1, and WNT5A gene promoters was higher, while those of SOX17, PRICKLE1, DAAM2, and MYC was lower in colon carcinoma compared to adenoma. Inverse correlation between expression and methylation was confirmed in 23 genes, including APC, CHP1, PRICKLE1, PSEN1, and SFRP1. Differential methylation affected both canonical and noncanonical WNT pathway genes in colorectal normal-adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Aberrant DNA methylation appears already in adenomas as an early event of colorectal carcinogenesis.",1
27238288,"The atypical chemokine receptor CXCR7/ACKR3 binds two endogenous chemokines, CXCL12 and CXCL11, and is upregulated in many cancers or following infection by several cancer-inducing viruses, including HHV-8. ACKR3 is a ligand-scavenging receptor and does not activate the canonical G protein pathways but was proposed to trigger β-arrestin-dependent signaling. Here, we identified the human herpesvirus 8-encoded CC chemokine vCCL2/vMIP-II as a third high-affinity ligand for ACKR3. vCCL2 acted as partial ACKR3 agonist, inducing β-arrestin recruitment to the receptor, subsequent reduction of its surface levels and its delivery to endosomes. In addition, ACKR3 reduced vCCL2-triggered MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt signaling through other chemokine receptors. Our data suggest that ACKR3 acts as a scavenger receptor for vCCL2, regulating its availability and activity toward human receptors, thereby likely controlling its function in HHV-8 infection. Our study provides new insights into the complex crosstalk between viral chemokines and host receptors as well as into the biology of ACKR3, this atypical and still enigmatic receptor.",1
27218841,"In the 1960s, several groups of scientists, including Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling, had noted that proteins experience amino acid replacements at a surprisingly consistent rate across very different species. This presumed single, uniform rate of genetic evolution was subsequently described using the term 'molecular clock'. Biologists quickly realised that such a universal pacemaker could be used as a yardstick for measuring the timescale of evolutionary divergences: estimating the rate of amino acid exchanges per unit of time and applying it to protein differences across a range of organisms would allow deduction of the divergence times of their respective lineages (Figure 1).",0
27196068,"ATP-binding cassette G1 (ABCG1) and ABCG4, expressed in neurons and glia in the central nervous system, mediate cholesterol efflux to lipid acceptors. The relationship between cholesterol level in the central nervous system and Alzheimer's disease has been reported. In this study, we examined the effects of ABCG1 and ABCG4 on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, the product of which, amyloid β (Aβ), is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Expression of ABCG1 or ABCG4 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells that stably expressed Swedish-type mutant APP increased cellular and cell surface APP levels. Products of cleavage from APP by α-secretase and by β-secretase also increased. The levels of secreted Aβ, however, decreased in the presence of ABCG1 and ABCG4, but not ABCG4-KM, a nonfunctional Walker-A lysine mutant. In contrast, secreted Aβ levels increased in differentiated SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells in which ABCG1 and ABCG4 were suppressed. Furthermore, Aβ42 peptide in the cerebrospinal fluid from Abcg1 null mice significantly increased compared to the wild type mice. To examine the underlying mechanism, we analyzed the activity and distribution of γ-secretase. ABCG1 and ABCG4 suppressed γ-secretase activity and disturbed γ-secretase localization in the raft domains where γ-secretase functions. These results suggest that ABCG1 and ABCG4 alter the distribution of γ-secretase on the plasma membrane, leading to the decreased γ-secretase activity and suppressed Aβ secretion. ABCG1 and ABCG4 may inhibit the development of Alzheimer's disease and can be targets for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",1
27191271,"To find a new locus that confers significant susceptibility to CAD in Chinese Han population, a genome-wide association study in 200 ""extreme individuals"" from a Shandong cohort and a pathway-based candidate gene study from a Shanghai cohort (293 CAD/293 controls) were simultaneously performed. Amongst them, 13 SNPs associated with CAD were selected to conduct validation and replication studies in additional 3363 CAD patients and 3148 controls. A novel locus rs700926 in natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPR-C) was identified in Shandong and Hubei cohorts. Then rs700926 and other nine tag SNPs were genotyped in four geographically different populations (Shandong, Shaanxi, Hubei and Sichuan cohorts), and 6 SNPs (rs700926, rs1833529, rs2270915, rs17541471, rs3792758 and rs696831) showed stronger association with CAD, regardless of single or combined analysis. We further genotyped rs2270915 and 10 additional tag SNPs in a central China cohort and identified rs12697273 and rs10066436 as the loci associated with CAD. All these positive associations remained significant after adjustment for traditional risk factors of CAD. NPR-C gene SNPs significantly contribute to CAD susceptibility in the Chinese Han population.",1
27189545,"The number of substitutions (of nucleotides, amino acids, etc.) that take place during the evolution of a sequence is a stochastic variable of fundamental importance in the field of molecular evolution. Although the mean number of substitutions during molecular evolution of a sequence can be estimated for a given substitution model, no simple solution exists for the variance of this random variable. We show in this article that the computation of the variance is as simple as that of the mean number of substitutions for both short and long times. Apart from its fundamental importance, this result can be used to investigate the dispersion index R, that is, the ratio of the variance to the mean substitution number, which is of prime importance in the neutral theory of molecular evolution. By investigating large classes of substitution models, we demonstrate that although [Formula: see text], to obtain R significantly larger than unity necessitates in general additional hypotheses on the structure of the substitution model.",0
27184932,"Integrin αvβ6 is involved in the transition from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast. In addition, integrin β6 (ITGB6) is of prognostic value in invasive breast cancers, particularly in HER2+ subtype. However, pathways mediating the activity of integrin αvβ6 in clinical progression of invasive breast cancers need further elucidation. We have examined human breast cancer specimens (N = 460) for the expression of integrin β6 (ITGB6) mRNA by qPCR. In addition, we have examined a subset (N = 147) for the expression of αvβ6 integrin by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expression levels of members of Rho-Rac pathway including downstream genes (ACTR2, ACTR3) and effector proteinases (MMP9, MMP15) were estimated by qPCR in the HER2+ subset (N = 59). There is a significant increase in the mean expression of ITGB6 in HER2+ tumors compared to HR+HER2- and triple negative (TNBC) subtypes (P = 0.00). HER2+ tumors with the highest levels (top quartile) of ITGB6 have significantly elevated levels of all the genes of the Rho-Rac pathway (P-values from 0.01 to 0.0001). Patients in this group have a significantly shorter disease-free survival compared to the group with lower ITGB6 levels (HR = 2.9 (0.9-8.9), P = 0.05). The mean level of ITGB6 expression is increased further in lymph node-positive tumors. The increased regional and distant metastasis observed in HER2+ tumors with high levels of ITGB6 might be mediated by the canonical Rho-Rac pathway through increased expression of MMP9 and MMP15.",1
27171439,"Dysregulated lipid metabolism contributes to cancer progression. Our previous study indicates that long-chain fatty acyl-Co A synthetase (ACSL) 3 is essential for lipid upregulation induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress. In this report, we aimed to identify the role of ACSL family in cancer with systematic analysis and in vitro experiment. We explored the ACSL expression using Oncomine database to determine the gene alteration during carcinogenesis and identified the association between ACSL expression and the survival of cancer patient using PrognoScan database. ACSL1 may play a potential oncogenic role in colorectal and breast cancer and play a potential tumor suppressor role in lung cancer. Co-expression analysis revealed that ACSL1 was coexpressed with MYBPH, PTPRE, PFKFB3, SOCS3 in colon cancer and with LRRFIP1, TSC22D1 in lung cancer. In accordance with PrognoScan analysis, downregulation of ACSL1 in colon and breast cancer cell line inhibited proliferation, migration, and anchorage-independent growth. In contrast, increase of oncogenic property was observed in lung cancer cell line by attenuating ACSL1. High ACSL3 expression predicted a better prognosis in ovarian cancer; in contrast, high ACSL3 predicted a worse prognosis in melanoma. ACSL3 was coexpressed with SNUPN, TRIP13, and SEMA5A in melanoma. High expression of ACSL4 predicted a worse prognosis in colorectal cancer, but predicted better prognosis in breast, brain and lung cancer. ACSL4 was coexpressed with SERPIN2, HNRNPCL1, ITIH2, PROCR, LRRFIP1. High expression of ACSL5 predicted good prognosis in breast, ovarian, and lung cancers. ACSL5 was coexpressed with TMEM140, TAPBPL, BIRC3, PTPRE, and SERPINB1. Low ACSL6 predicted a worse prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia. ACSL6 was coexpressed with SOX6 and DARC. Altogether, different members of ACSLs are implicated in diverse types of cancer development. ACSL-coexpressed molecules may be used to further investigate the role of ACSL family in individual type of cancers.",1
27153395,"Sequencing tests assaying panels of genes or whole exomes are widely available for cancer risk evaluation. However, methods for classification of variants resulting from this testing are not well studied. We evaluated the ability of a variant-classification methodology based on American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines to define the rate of mutations and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in 180 medically relevant genes, including all ACMG-designated reportable cancer and non-cancer-associated genes, in individuals who met guidelines for hereditary cancer risk evaluation. We performed whole-exome sequencing in 404 individuals in 253 families and classified 1,640 variants. Potentially clinically actionable (likely pathogenic [LP] or pathogenic [P]) versus nonactionable (VUS, likely benign, or benign) calls were 95% concordant with locus-specific databases and Clinvar. LP or P mutations were identified in 12 of 25 breast cancer susceptibility genes in 26 families without identified BRCA1/2 mutations (11%). Evaluation of 84 additional genes associated with autosomal-dominant cancer susceptibility identified LP or P mutations in only two additional families (0.8%). However, individuals from 10 of 253 families (3.9%) had incidental LP or P mutations in 32 non-cancer-associated genes, and 9% of individuals were monoallelic carriers of a rare LP or P mutation in 39 genes associated with autosomal-recessive cancer susceptibility. Furthermore, 95% of individuals had at least one VUS. In summary, these data support the clinical utility of ACMG variant-classification guidelines. Additionally, evaluation of extended panels of cancer-associated genes in breast/ovarian cancer families leads to only an incremental clinical benefit but substantially increases the complexity of the results.",1
27132795,"Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles that are responsible for degrading and recycling macromolecules. Lysosomal dysfunction occurs in enzymatic and non-enzymatic deficiencies, which result in abnormal accumulation of materials. Although lysosomal storage disorders affect different organs, the central nervous system is the most vulnerable. Evidence shows the role of lysosomal dysfunction in different neurodegenerative diseases, such as Niemann-Pick Type C disease, juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Lysosomal enzymes such as lysosomal acid phosphatase 2 (Acp2) play a critical role in mannose-6-phosphate removal and Acp2 controls molecular and cellular functions in the brain during development and adulthood. Acp2 is essential in cerebellar development, and mutations in this gene cause severe cerebellar neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. In this mini-review, we highlight lysosomal dysfunctions in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and/or neurodegenerative diseases with special attention to Acp2 dysfunction.",1

27124358,"Expression of the miR-34 family (miR-34a, -34b, -34c) is elevated in settings of heart disease, and inhibition with antimiR-34a/antimiR-34 has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Under chronic cardiac disease settings, targeting the entire miR-34 family is more effective than targeting miR-34a alone. The identification of transcription factor (TF)-miRNA regulatory networks has added complexity to understanding the therapeutic potential of miRNA-based therapies. Here, we sought to determine whether antimiR-34 targets secondary miRNAs via TFs which could contribute to antimiR-34-mediated protection. Using miRNA-Seq we identified differentially regulated miRNAs in hearts from mice with cardiac pathology due to transverse aortic constriction (TAC), and focused on miRNAs which were also regulated by antimiR-34. Two clusters of stress-responsive miRNAs were classified as ""pathological"" and ""cardioprotective,"" respectively. Using ChIPBase we identified 45 TF binding sites on the promoters of ""pathological"" and ""cardioprotective"" miRNAs, and 5 represented direct targets of miR-34, with the capacity to regulate other miRNAs. Knockdown studies in a cardiomyoblast cell line demonstrated that expression of 2 ""pathological"" miRNAs (let-7e, miR-31) was regulated by one of the identified TFs. Furthermore, by qPCR we confirmed that expression of let-7e and miR-31 was lower in hearts from antimiR-34 treated TAC mice; this may explain why targeting the entire miR-34 family is more effective than targeting miR-34a alone. Finally, we showed that Acsl4 (a common target of miR-34, let-7e and miR-31) was increased in hearts from TAC antimiR-34 treated mice. In summary, antimiR-34 regulates the expression of other miRNAs and this has implications for drug development.",1
27121416,"Gallstones grow inside the gallbladder or biliary tract. These stones can be asymptomatic or symptomatic; only gallstones with symptoms or complications are defined as gallstone disease. Based on their composition, gallstones are classified into cholesterol gallstones, which represent the predominant entity, and bilirubin ('pigment') stones. Black pigment stones can be caused by chronic haemolysis; brown pigment stones typically develop in obstructed and infected bile ducts. For treatment, localization of the gallstones in the biliary tract is more relevant than composition. Overall, up to 20% of adults develop gallstones and >20% of those develop symptoms or complications. Risk factors for gallstones are female sex, age, pregnancy, physical inactivity, obesity and overnutrition. Factors involved in metabolic syndrome increase the risk of developing gallstones and form the basis of primary prevention by lifestyle changes. Common mutations in the hepatic cholesterol transporter ABCG8 confer most of the genetic risk of developing gallstones, which accounts for ∼25% of the total risk. Diagnosis is mainly based on clinical symptoms, abdominal ultrasonography and liver biochemistry tests. Symptoms often precede the onset of the three common and potentially life-threatening complications of gallstones (acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis and biliary pancreatitis). Although our knowledge on the genetics and pathophysiology of gallstones has expanded recently, current treatment algorithms remain predominantly invasive and are based on surgery. Hence, our future efforts should focus on novel preventive strategies to overcome the onset of gallstones in at-risk patients in particular, but also in the population in general.",1
27117140,"Melanocytic lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) may be primary to the site but are more commonly metastases from cutaneous primaries. In fact, melanomas are one of the most common malignancies that can metastasize to the brain, and some patients may not have a diagnosis of melanoma prior to the discovery of the CNS lesion. In such cases, identifying the primary site may be challenging. We reviewed the archives of a large referral center for melanocytic tumors involving the CNS and selected 48 patients for this study based on our inclusion criteria. We used sequencing to identify mutation status of these tumors and compared these with clinicopathological features. Mutations in exon 9, 11, 13, 17, and 18 of KIT gene, exon 15 of BRAF gene, exon 2 and 3 of NRAS gene, exon 4 and 5 of GNAQ and GNA11 genes were analyzed. Mutations in BRAF-exon 15 were the most common among tumors (58.3%). NRAS-exon 2 and NRAS-exon 3 mutations were detected in 3 and 7 cases, respectively. GNAQ-exon 4, GNAQ-exon 5 and GNA11-exon 5 mutation were present in 1 tumor each. Eight tumors were wild type for all 5 genes, and 6 of these were not known primary despite a work-up and clinical follow-up. Only 1 of these tumors showed a mutation in exon 11 of KIT gene. When compared to primary melanocytic lesions of the CNS, metastatic melanomas were characterized by BRAF gene mutations and wild-type GNAQ and GNA11 genes.",1
27098658,"The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterised by venous and/or arterial thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity in women combined with the persistent presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). We aimed to identify genetic factors associated with the presence of aPL in a population based cohort. Furthermore, we wanted to clarify if the presence of aPL affects gene expression in circulating monocytes. Titres of IgG and IgM against cardiolipin, β2glycoprotein 1 (anti-β2GPI), and IgG against domain 1 of β2GPI (anti-domain 1) were determined in approx. 5,000 individuals from the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) a population based cohort of German descent. Genotyping was conducted on Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 arrays. Monocyte gene expression was determined in a subgroup of 1,279 individuals by using the Illumina HT-12 v3 BeadChip. Gene expression data were confirmed in vitro and ex vivo by qRT-PCR. Genome wide analysis revealed significant associations of anti-β2GPI IgG and APOH on chromosome 17, which had been previously identified by candidate gene approaches, and of anti-domain1 and MACROD2 on chromosome 20 which has been listed in a previous GWAS as a suggestive locus associated with the occurrence of anti-β2GPI antibodies. Expression analysis confirmed increased expression of TNFα in monocytes and identified and confirmed neuron navigator 3 (NAV3) as a novel gene induced by aPL. In conclusion, MACROD2 represents a novel genetic locus associated with aPL. Furthermore, we show that aPL induce the expression of NAV3 in monocytes and endothelial cells. This will stimulate further research into the role of these genes in the APS.",1

In order to highlight the role of chemical cues and toxins in plankton ecology this review has been organized by ecological interaction types starting with intraspecific interactions, then interspecific interactions (including facilitation and mutualism, host-parasite, allelopathy, and predator-prey), and finally community and ecosystem-wide interactions.",0
27082954,"There is a growing literature indicating that genetic variants modify many of the associations between environmental exposures and clinical outcomes, potentially by increasing susceptibility to these exposures. However, genome-scale investigations of these interactions have been rarely performed particularly in the case of air pollution exposures. We performed race-stratified genome-wide gene-environment interaction association studies on European-American (EA, N = 1623) and African-American (AA, N = 554) cohorts to investigate the joint influence of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and residential exposure to traffic (""traffic exposure"")-a recognized vascular disease risk factor-on peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Traffic exposure was estimated via the distance from the primary residence to the nearest major roadway, defined as the nearest limited access highways or major arterial. The rs755249-traffic exposure interaction was associated with PAD at a genome-wide significant level (P = 2.29x10-8) in European-Americans. Rs755249 is located in the 3' untranslated region of BMP8A, a member of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) gene family. Further investigation revealed several variants in BMP genes associated with PAD via an interaction with traffic exposure in both the EA and AA cohorts; this included interactions with non-synonymous variants in BMP2, which is regulated by air pollution exposure. The BMP family of genes is linked to vascular growth and calcification and is a novel gene family for the study of PAD pathophysiology. Further investigation of BMP8A using the Genotype Tissue Expression Database revealed multiple variants with nominally significant (P < 0.05) interaction P-values in our EA cohort were significant BMP8A eQTLs in tissue types highlight relevant for PAD such as rs755249 (tibial nerve, eQTL P = 3.6x10-6) and rs1180341 (tibial artery, eQTL P = 5.3x10-6). Together these results reveal a novel gene, and possibly gene family, associated with PAD via an interaction with traffic air pollution exposure. These results also highlight the potential for interactions studies, particularly at the genome scale, to reveal novel biology linking environmental exposures to clinical outcomes.",1
27057633,"Melanomas arising in association with a common or cellular blue nevus (MABN) comprise a relatively rare and heterogeneous group of lethal melanomas. Although GNAQ is known to be frequently mutated in common blue nevus, cellular blue nevus (CBN) and MABN and these malignant lesions present gross chromosome alterations harboring BAP1 mutations, little is known about other mutations that contribute to the development and progression of these neoplasms. Thus, the genetic profile of these tumors is important to increase the number of intervention and treatment modalities. Here, we characterized and genetically profiled two different sections of a rare MABN and two CBNs from three different patients. All of the samples harbored a GNAQ mutation, exhibited RAS pathway activation, and harbored additional mutations in genes associated with genomic instability and epigenetic regulation (KMT2C, FANCD2, ATR, ATRX, NBN, ERCC2, SETD2, and WHSC1). In addition, all neoplasms harbored mutations that directly or indirectly affected either the regulation or activation of the PI3K pathway (PIK3CA, NF1, INPP5B and GSK3B). Our results not only help understand the genetic complexity of these blue melanocytic lesions but provide a rationale to use the combination of PI3K/MTOR and MEK1/2 inhibitors against these types of tumors.",1

27033238,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous disease at the genetic level. Chromosomal abnormalities are used as diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers to provide subtype, outcome and drug response information. t(12;21)/ETV6-RUNX1 and high hyper-diploidy are good-risk prognostic biomarkers whereas KMT2A(MLL) translocations, t(17;19)/TCF3-HLF, haploidy or low hypodiploidy are high-risk biomarkers. t(9;22)/BCR-ABL1 patients require targeted treatment (imatinib/dasatinib), whereas iAMP21 patients achieve better outcomes when treated intensively. High-risk genetic biomarkers are four times more prevalent in adults compared to children. The application of genomic technologies to cases without an established abnormality (B-other) reveals copy number alterations which can be used either individually or in combination as prognostic biomarkers. Transcriptome sequencing studies have identified a network of fusion genes involving kinase genes -ABL1,ABL2,PDGFRB,CSF1R,CRLF2,JAK2 and EPOR in-vitro and in-vivo studies along with emerging clinical observations indicate that patients with a kinase-activating aberration may respond to treatment with small molecular inhibitors like imatinib/dasatinib and ruxolitinib. Further work is required to determine the true frequency of these abnormalities across the age spectrum and the optimal way to incorporate such inhibitors into protocols. In conclusion, genetic biomarkers are playing an increasingly important role in the management of patients with ALL.",1
27028815,"A group of patients with ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction (N = 156) and a reference population sample (N = 300) were genotyped for 58 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes involved in extracellular matrix function and collagen metabolism or associated with cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerotic plaque stability. Genotyping was performed by mass-spectrometry with two multiplex sets of 27 and 31 SNPs. The study revealed different genetic composition of predisposition to cardiovascular disease continuum (CVDC) syntropy (patients with concomitant conditions: hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and type-II diabetes mellitus, N = 96) and to isolated myocardial infarction (without these conditions, N = 60). Only the KIAA1462 gene (rs3739998) showed associations with both CVDC syntropy (OR = 1.71; 95% CI 1.19-2.45; р = 0.003) and isolated infarction (OR = 1.58; 95% CI 1.05-2.40; р = 0.028). Isolated myocardial infarction was also associated with LIG1 (rs20579) (OR = 2.08; 95% CI 1.06-4.17; р = 0.028) and ADAMDEC1 (rs3765124) (OR = 1.63; 95% CI 1.07-2.50; р = 0.020). CVDC syntropy was associated with CDKN2BAS1 (rs1333049) (OR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.03-2.12; р = 0.029) and APOA2 (rs5082) (OR = 1.47; 95% CI 1.02-2.11; р = 0.035). So, genes involved in fibrogenesis contribute to predisposition to the myocardial infarction as well. Isolated myocardial infarction and CVDC syntropy can be considered as pathogenetically different cardiovascular conditions, with different genes that contribute to the susceptibility.",1
27025572,"Members of the genus Ranavirus (family Iridoviridae) are large double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses that are found world-wide infecting fish, amphibian and reptile ectothermic hosts. Ranavirus genomes range from 105 to 155kbp in length and they are predicted to encode around 90-125 genes. Currently, our knowledge of the function of ∼50% of these genes is known or inferred based on homology to orthologous genes characterized in other systems; however, the function of the remaining open reading frames (ORFS) is unknown. Therefore, in order to begin to uncover the function of unknown ORFs in ranaviruses we developed a standardized approach to generate a recombination cassette for any ORF in Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV). Our standardized approach quickly and efficiently assembles recombination cassettes and recombinant ATV. We have used this approach to identify two essential, one semi-essential and two non-essential genes in ATV.",0
27020472,"Myopia is the most common human eye disorder and it results from complex genetic and environmental causes. The rapidly increasing prevalence of myopia poses a major public health challenge. Here, the CREAM consortium performs a joint meta-analysis to test single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) main effects and SNP × education interaction effects on refractive error in 40,036 adults from 25 studies of European ancestry and 10,315 adults from 9 studies of Asian ancestry. In European ancestry individuals, we identify six novel loci (FAM150B-ACP1, LINC00340, FBN1, DIS3L-MAP2K1, ARID2-SNAT1 and SLC14A2) associated with refractive error. In Asian populations, three genome-wide significant loci AREG, GABRR1 and PDE10A also exhibit strong interactions with education (P<8.5 × 10(-5)), whereas the interactions are less evident in Europeans. The discovery of these loci represents an important advance in understanding how gene and environment interactions contribute to the heterogeneity of myopia.",1
27006499,"Mutations in SMAD4 predispose to the development of gastrointestinal cancer, which is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. To identify genes driving gastric cancer (GC) development, we performed a Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon mutagenesis screen in the stomach of Smad4(+/-) mutant mice. This screen identified 59 candidate GC trunk drivers and a much larger number of candidate GC progression genes. Strikingly, 22 SB-identified trunk drivers are known or candidate cancer genes, whereas four SB-identified trunk drivers, including PTEN, SMAD4, RNF43, and NF1, are known human GC trunk drivers. Similar to human GC, pathway analyses identified WNT, TGF-β, and PI3K-PTEN signaling, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, adherens junctions, and RNA degradation in addition to genes involved in chromatin modification and organization as highly deregulated pathways in GC. Comparative oncogenomic filtering of the complete list of SB-identified genes showed that they are highly enriched for genes mutated in human GC and identified many candidate human GC genes. Finally, by comparing our complete list of SB-identified genes against the list of mutated genes identified in five large-scale human GC sequencing studies, we identified LDL receptor-related protein 1B (LRP1B) as a previously unidentified human candidate GC tumor suppressor gene. In LRP1B, 129 mutations were found in 462 human GC samples sequenced, and LRP1B is one of the top 10 most deleted genes identified in a panel of 3,312 human cancers. SB mutagenesis has, thus, helped to catalog the cooperative molecular mechanisms driving SMAD4-induced GC growth and discover genes with potential clinical importance in human GC.",1
27002987,"Gene synthesis is getting more important with the growing availability of low-cost commercial services. The coding sequences are often ""optimized"" as for the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) before synthesis, which is generally included in the commercial services. However, the codon optimization processes are different among different providers and are often hidden from the users. Here, the d'Hondt method, which is widely adopted as a method for determining the number of seats for each party in proportional-representation public elections, is applied to RSCU fitting. This allowed me to make a set of electronic spreadsheets for manual design of protein coding sequences for expression in Escherichia coli, with which users can see the process of codon optimization and can manually edit the codons after the automatic optimization. The spreadsheets may also be useful for molecular biology education.",0
27001270,"Glaucoma is the largest cause of irreversible blindness affecting more than 60 million people globally. The disease is defined as a gradual loss of peripheral vision due to death of Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGC). The RGC death is largely influenced by the rate of aqueous humor production by ciliary processes and its passage through the trabecular meshwork (TM) in the anterior part of the eye. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common subtype, is a genetically complex disease. Multiple genes and many loci have been reported to be involved in POAG but taken together they explain less than 10 % of the patients from a genetic perspective warranting more studies in different world populations. The purpose of this study was to perform genome-wide search for common variants associated with POAG in an east-Indian population.",1

26942290,"Encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis (ECCL) is a sporadic condition characterized by ocular, cutaneous, and central nervous system anomalies. Key clinical features include a well-demarcated hairless fatty nevus on the scalp, benign ocular tumors, and central nervous system lipomas. Seizures, spasticity, and intellectual disability can be present, although affected individuals without seizures and with normal intellect have also been reported. Given the patchy and asymmetric nature of the malformations, ECCL has been hypothesized to be due to a post-zygotic, mosaic mutation. Despite phenotypic overlap with several other disorders associated with mutations in the RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, the molecular etiology of ECCL remains unknown. Using exome sequencing of DNA from multiple affected tissues from five unrelated individuals with ECCL, we identified two mosaic mutations, c.1638C>A (p.Asn546Lys) and c.1966A>G (p.Lys656Glu) within the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR1, in two affected individuals each. These two residues are the most commonly mutated residues in FGFR1 in human cancers and are associated primarily with CNS tumors. Targeted resequencing of FGFR1 in multiple tissues from an independent cohort of individuals with ECCL identified one additional individual with a c.1638C>A (p.Asn546Lys) mutation in FGFR1. Functional studies of ECCL fibroblast cell lines show increased levels of phosphorylated FGFRs and phosphorylated FRS2, a direct substrate of FGFR1, as well as constitutive activation of RAS-MAPK signaling. In addition to identifying the molecular etiology of ECCL, our results support the emerging overlap between mosaic developmental disorders and tumorigenesis.",1
26934405,"α-smooth muscle actin, encoded by ACTA2 gene, is an isoform of the vascular smooth muscle actins, typically expressed in the vascular smooth muscle cells contributing to vascular motility and contraction. ACTA2 gene mutations cause a diversity of diffuse vasculopathies such as thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections as well as occlusive vascular diseases, including premature coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke. Dynamics of differentiation-specific α-smooth muscle actin in arterial smooth muscle cells and proliferation of the proteins have been well described. Although a variety of research works have been undertaken in terms of modifications of α-smooth muscle actin and mutations of ACTA2 gene and myosin, the underlying mechanisms towards the pathological processes by way of gene mutations are yet to be clarified. The purpose of the present article is to describe the phenotypes of α-smooth muscle actin and implications of ACTA2 mutations in vasculopathies in order to enhance the understanding of potential mechanisms of aortic and coronary disorders.",1
26930657,"ADAM15 is a member of a family of catalytically active disintegrin membrane metalloproteinases that function as molecular signaling switches, shed membrane bound growth factors and/or cleave and inactivate cell adhesion molecules. Aberrant metalloproteinase function of ADAM15 may contribute to tumor progression through the release of growth factors or disruption of cell adhesion. In this study, we utilized human bladder cancer tissues and cell lines to evaluate the expression and function of ADAM15 in the progression of human bladder cancer. Examination of genome and transcriptome databases revealed that ADAM15 ranked in the top 5% of amplified genes and its mRNA was significantly overexpressed in invasive and metastatic bladder cancer compared to noninvasive disease. Immunostaining of a bladder tumor tissue array designed to evaluate disease progression revealed increased ADAM15 immunoreactivity associated with increasing cancer stage and exhibited significantly stronger staining in metastatic samples. About half of the invasive tumors and the majority of the metastatic cases exhibited high ADAM15 staining index, while all low grade and noninvasive cases exhibited negative or low staining. The knockdown of ADAM15 mRNA expression significantly inhibited bladder tumor cell migration and reduced the invasive capacity of bladder tumor cells through MatrigelTM and monolayers of vascular endothelium. The knockdown of ADAM15 in a human xenograft model of bladder cancer inhibited tumor growth by 45% compared to controls. Structural modeling of the catalytic domain led to the design of a novel ADAM15-specific sulfonamide inhibitor that demonstrated bioactivity and significantly reduced the viability of bladder cancer cells in vitro and in human bladder cancer xenografts. Taken together, the results revealed an undescribed role of ADAM15 in the invasion of human bladder cancer and suggested that the ADAM15 catalytic domain may represent a viable therapeutic target in patients with advanced disease.",1
26918856,"ADAM28 (disintegrin and metalloproteinase 28), which was originally reported to be lymphocyte-specific, is over-expressed by carcinoma cells and plays a key role in cell proliferation and progression in human lung and breast carcinomas. We studied ADAM28 expression in human normal tissues and examined its biological function. By using antibodies specific to ADAM28, ADAM28 was immunolocalized mainly to epithelial cells in several tissues, including epididymis, bronchus and stomach, whereas lymphocytes in lymph nodes and spleen were negligibly immunostained. RT-PCR, immunoblotting and ELISA analyses confirmed the expression in these tissues, and low or negligible expression by lymphocytes was found in the lymph node and spleen. C1q was identified as a candidate ADAM28-binding protein from a human lung cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid system, and specific binding was demonstrated by binding assays, immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance. C1q treatment of normal bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B and NHBE cells, both of which showed low-level expression of ADAM28, caused apoptosis through activation of p38 and caspase-3, and cell death with autophagy through accumulation of LC3-II and autophagosomes, respectively. C1q-induced cell death was attenuated by treatment of the cells with antibodies against the C1q receptor gC1qR/p33 or cC1qR/calreticulin. Treatment of C1q with recombinant ADAM28 prior to addition to culture media reduced C1q-induced cell death, and knockdown of ADAM28 using siRNAs increased cell death. These data demonstrate that ADAM28 is expressed by epithelial cells of several normal organs, and suggest that ADAM28 plays a role in cell survival by suppression of C1q-induced cytotoxicity in bronchial epithelial cells.",1

26896819,"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a rare and as yet untreatable genetic disorder of progressive extraskeletal ossification, is the most disabling form of heterotopic ossification (HO) in humans and causes skeletal deformities, movement impairment, and premature death. Most FOP patients carry an activating mutation in a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor gene, ACVR1(R206H) , that promotes ectopic chondrogenesis and osteogenesis and, in turn, HO. We showed previously that the retinoic acid receptor γ (RARγ) agonist palovarotene effectively inhibited HO in injury-induced and genetic mouse models of the disease. Here we report that the drug additionally prevents spontaneous HO, using a novel conditional-on knock-in mouse line carrying the human ACVR1(R206H) mutation for classic FOP. In addition, palovarotene restored long bone growth, maintained growth plate function, and protected growing mutant neonates when given to lactating mothers. Importantly, palovarotene maintained joint, limb, and body motion, providing clear evidence for its encompassing therapeutic potential as a treatment for FOP. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",1
26891804,"Somatic mutations of the BRCA1 associated protein-1 (BAP1) gene, which maps to 3p21, have been found in several tumors including malignant mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The role of BAP1 inactivation in tumor development remains unclear. It has been reported that Vhl knock-out mice did not develop RCC, but Vhl knock-out mice with single allele loss of Bap1 in nephron progenitor cells developed RCC, indicating that Bap1 inactivation may be essential in murine renal tumorigenesis. To clarify the role of BAP1 in human RCC development, we performed mutation analyses, including copy number detection of BAP1 and assessment of allelic imbalance using microsatellite polymorphisms on 3p, in 45 RCC samples derived from 45 patients without VHL or BAP1 germline mutation. Additionally, we analyzed the sequences of the VHL, PBRM1, and SETD2 genes, and examined promoter methylation of VHL. Using immunostaining, we also checked for expression of BAP1 protein, which is normally located in the nuclei. None of the RCCs had biallelic deletion of BAP1, but five (11.1%) showed a biallelic mutation (four with a sequence-level mutation with monoallelic loss and one with a biallelic sequence-level mutation); these cells were negative for nuclear BAP1 staining. These patients had worse recurrence-free survival than the patients without a biallelic mutation (p=0.046). However, there were no significant differences in worse outcome by multivariate analysis combined with age, T stage, histological subtype, infiltration and vascular invasion. In 35 RCCs (77.8%), monoallelic loss of BAP1 was accompanied by VHL biallelic mutation or VHL promoter hypermethylation. In five RCCs (11.1%), we detected 3p loss-of-heterozygosity, but the copy number of BAP1 was normal. Surprisingly, nuclear staining of BAP1 was negative in 10 out of 31 tumors (32.3%) with hemizygous normal BAP1, suggesting that haploinsufficiency may relate to RCC development.",1
26888488,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of infertility with metalloproteinases ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS5, which are known to be responsible for the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins associated with many diseases. ECM is the noncellular component that provides structural and biochemical support to the surrounding cells required for tissue morphogenesis, differentiation and homoeostasis. Sixty infertile individuals and 10 healthy semen donors were included in this study. The infertile individuals were classified as normozoospermia (NS; n = 20), oligozoospermia (OS; n = 20), azoospermia (AS; n = 20) groups. ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS5 protein levels in semen were analysed by Western blot. ADAMTS1 protein level was 3.0-, 3.3- and 1.6-fold lower in the OS, AS and NS groups, respectively, than in the control group (P < 0.001). ADAMTS5 protein level was 3.2-, 2.7- and 1.4-fold lower in the OS, AS and NS groups, respectively, than in the control group (P < 0.001). Sperm count and sperm motility showed a negative correlation with the levels of ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS5 protein expression: r = -0.477, r = -0.470; and r = -0.332, r = -0.275 respectively (P < 0.001). In conclusion, ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS5 protein expressions in semen are significantly related with sperm production. It is very important to understand molecular function and organisation of ADAMTSs which will be significant in enlightening the process of spermatogenesis in male infertility.",1
26887001,"The minimizing-deep-coalescence (MDC) approach infers a median (species) tree for a given set of gene trees under the deep coalescence cost. This cost accounts for the minimum number of deep coalescences needed to reconcile a gene tree with a species tree where the leaf-genes are mapped to the leaf-species through a function called leaf labeling. In order to better understand the MDC approach we investigate here the diameter of a gene tree, which is an important property of the deep coalescence cost. This diameter is the maximal deep coalescence costs for a given gene tree under all leaf labelings for each possible species tree topology. While we prove that this diameter is generally infinite, this result relies on the diameter's unrealistic assumption that species trees can be of infinite size. Providing a more practical definition, we introduce a natural extension of the gene tree diameter that constrains the species tree size by a given constant. For this new diameter, we describe an exact formula, present a complete classification of the trees yielding this diameter, derive formulas for its mean and variance, and demonstrate its ability using comparative studies.",0
26883881,"Vitamin consumption prior to and during pregnancy has increased as a result of proactive recommendations by health professionals, wide availability of vitamin supplements, and liberal food-fortification policies. Folic acid, alone or in combination with other B vitamins, is the most recommended vitamin consumed during pregnancy because deficiency of this vitamin leads to birth defects in the infant. Folic acid and other B vitamins are also integral components of biochemical processes that are essential to the development of regulatory systems that control the ability of the offspring to adapt to the external environment. Although few human studies have investigated the lasting effects of high vitamin intakes during pregnancy, animal models have shown that excess vitamin supplementation during gestation is associated with negative metabolic effects in both the mothers and their offspring. This research from animal models, combined with the recognition that epigenetic regulation of gene expression is plastic, provides evidence for further examination of these relationships in the later life of pregnant women and their children.",0

Here, based on published guidelines for reporting suspected adverse drug reactions, I propose a checklist for reporting details of suspected drug interactions, the REporting Anecdotal Drug Interactions (READI) checklist, hoping to stimulate discussion and improve reporting of suspected drug interactions. The checklist includes items relating, among others, to the patient affected, the drugs involved, and the outcome.",0
26861389,"Dietary intake and higher serum concentrations of lycopene have been associated with lower incidence of prostate cancer and other chronic diseases. Identifying determinants of serum lycopene concentrations may thus have important public health implications. Prior studies have suggested that serum lycopene concentrations are under partial genetic control. The goal of this research was to identify genetic predictors of serum lycopene concentrations using the genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach among a sample of 441 Old Order Amish adults that consumed a controlled diet. Linear regression models were utilized to evaluate associations between genetic variants and serum concentrations of lycopene. Variant rs7680948 on chromosome 4, located in the intron region of the SETD7 gene, was significantly associated with serum lycopene concentrations (p = 3.41 × 10(-9)). Our findings also provided nominal support for the association previously noted between SCARB1 and serum lycopene concentrations, although with a different SNP (rs11057841) in the region. This study identified a novel locus associated with serum lycopene concentrations and our results raise a number of intriguing possibilities regarding the nature of the relationship between SETD7 and lycopene, both of which have been independently associated with prostate cancer. Further investigation into this relationship might help provide greater mechanistic understanding of these associations.",1

26856250,"The search for biomarkers of response to antipsychotic medications is hindered by difficulties inherent in the topic or related to persistent methodological difficulties, such as high rates of anticipated discontinuation and consequent distortions in the imputation of missing data. Because early response to antipsychotics represents a sufficiently reliable index of the subsequent treatment response in patients with schizophrenia, we undertook a real-world, genome-wide association study (GWAS) with the aim of identifying genetic predictors of response to risperidone after 2 weeks in 86 patients with schizophrenia. Limited to the associations reaching significance in the GWAS, confirmatory analysis relative to risperidone response over 9 months was also designed involving 97 patients (European only) enroled in the CATIE (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness) genetic substudy. The GWAS revealed a significant association (false discovery rate 0.02) of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2133450 inside the GRM7 gene with Emsley's positive domain derived from the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Patients with the rs2133450 CC genotype presented poorer improvement in the positive domain over 2 weeks, with odds ratios of 12.68 (95% CI, 3.51-45.76) and 6.95 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.37-20.37) compared with patients with the AA and AC genotypes, respectively. Compared with A homozygotes, rs2133450 C homozygotes enroled in the CATIE-derived confirmatory analysis showed less improvement in Emsley's positive, excited and depression domains, positive and general PANSS subtypes, and total PANSS after 9 months of treatment with risperidone. The original GWAS and the CATIE-derived confirmatory analysis support the proposal that the rs2133450 may have translational relevance as a predictor of response to risperidone.",1
26820484,"Membrane transporters (such as ABCs, SLCs and ATPases) act in carcinogenesis and chemoresistance development, but their relevance for prognosis of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains poorly understood. We evaluated the gene expression profile of 39 ABC and 12 SLC transporters and three ATPases in EOC tissues and addressed their putative role in prognosis and clinical course of EOC patients. Relative gene expression in a set of primary EOC (n=57) and in control ovarian tissues (n=14) was estimated and compared with clinical data and survival of patients. Obtained data were validated in an independent set of patients (n=60). Six ABCs and SLC22A18 gene were significantly overexpressed in carcinomas when compared with controls, while expression of 12 ABCs, five SLCs, ATP7A and ATP11B was decreased. Expression of ABCA12, ABCC3, ABCC6, ABCD3, ABCG1 and SLC22A5 was higher in high grade serous carcinoma compared with other subtypes. ABCA2 gene expression significantly associated with EOC grade in both sets of patients. Notably, expression level of ABCA9, ABCA10, ABCC9 and SLC16A14 significantly associated with progression-free survival (PFS) of the disease in either pilot or validation sets. ABCG2 level associated with PFS in the pooled set of patients. In conclusion, ABCA2, ABCA9, ABCA10, ABCC9, ABCG2 and SLC16A14 present novel putative markers of EOC progression and together with the revealed relationship between ABCA12, ABCC3, ABCC6, ABCD3, ABCG1 and SLC22A5 expression, and high grade serous type of EOC should be further examined by larger follow-up study.",1
26813566,"Chemokine receptor-like 1 (CCRL1) has the potential in creating a low level of CCL19 and CCL21 to hinder CCR7(+) cell tracking to tumor tissue. Previously, we found a tumor suppressive role of CCRL1 by impairing CCR7-related chemotaxis of tumor cells in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we reported a contribution of CCR7(+) mononuclear cells in the tumor microenvironment to the progression of disease. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the distribution and clinical significance of CCR7(+) cells in a cohort of 240 HCC patients. Furthermore, the phenotype, composition, and functional status of CCR7(+) cells were determined by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and in vitro co-culture assays. We found that CCR7(+) mononuclear cells were dispersed around tumor tissue and negatively related to tumoral expression of CCRL1 (P < 0.001, r = 0.391). High density of CCR7(+) mononuclear cells positively correlated with the absence of tumor capsule, vascular invasion, and poor differentiation (P < 0.05). Survival analyses revealed that increased number of CCR7(+) mononuclear cells was significantly associated with worse survival and increased recurrence. We found that CCR7(+) mononuclear cells featured a naive Treg-like phenotype (CD45RA(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+)) and possessed tumor-promoting potential by producing TGF-β1. Moreover, CCR7(+) cells were also composed of several immunocytes, a third of which were CD8(+) T cells. CCR7(+) Treg-like cells facilitate tumor growth and indicate unfavorable prognosis in HCC patients, but fortunately, their tracking to tumor tissue is under the control of CCRL1.",1
26802027,"Approximately half of children suffering from recurrent Wilms tumor (WT) develop resistance to salvage therapies. Hence the importance to disclose events driving tumor progression/recurrence. Future therapeutic trials, conducted in the setting of relapsing patients, will need to prioritize targets present in the recurrent lesions. Different studies identified primary tumor-specific signatures associated with poor prognosis. However, given the difficulty in recruiting specimens from recurrent WTs, little work has been done to compare the molecular profile of paired primary/recurrent diseases. We studied the genomic profile of a cohort of eight pairs of primary/recurrent WTs through whole-genome SNP arrays, and investigated known WT-associated genes, including SIX1, SIX2 and micro RNA processor genes, whose mutations have been recently proposed as associated with worse outcome. Through this approach, we sought to uncover anomalies characterizing tumor recurrence, either acquired de novo or already present in the primary disease, and to investigate whether they overlapped with known molecular prognostic signatures. Among the aberrations that we disclosed as potentially acquired de novo in recurrences, some had been already recognized in primary tumors as associated with a higher risk of relapse. These included allelic imbalances of chromosome 1q and of chromosome 3, and CN losses on chromosome 16q. In addition, we found that SIX1 and DROSHA mutations can be heterogeneous events (both spatially and temporally) within primary tumors, and that their co-occurrence might be positively selected in the progression to recurrent disease. Overall, these results provide new insights into genomic and genetic events underlying WT progression/recurrence.",1
26801681,"Microbes acquire DNA from a variety of sources. The last decades, which have seen the development of genome sequencing, have revealed that horizontal gene transfer has been a major evolutionary force that has constantly reshaped genomes throughout evolution. However, because the history of life must ultimately be deduced from gene phylogenies, the lack of methods to account for horizontal gene transfer has thrown into confusion the very concept of the tree of life. As a result, many questions remain open, but emerging methodological developments promise to use information conveyed by horizontal gene transfer that remains unexploited today.",0
26800504,"Cancer cells contain a small population of cancer stem cells or cancer initiating cells, which can be enriched in the side population (SP) after fluorescence activated cell sorting. To examine the members of the ADAM, ADAMTS and MMP gene families related to phenotypes of the SP and the main population (MP), we screened the expression of all the members in the propagated SP and MP of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, and found that the relative expression ratio of ADAM23 in the MP to the SP is most highly increased, but none of them are increased in the SP. A similar result on the ADAM23 expression was obtained with another cell line, Calu-3 cells. Overexpression of ADAM23 inhibited colony formation, cell adhesion and migration, and knockdown of ADAM23 by shRNA showed the reverse effects. ADAM23-mediated suppression of colony formation, cell adhesion and migration was greatly reduced by treatment with neutralizing anti-ADAM23 antibody, anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody and/or ADAM23 disintegrin peptide. Expression of cancer stem cell-related genes, including AKRC1/2, TM4SF1 and NR0B1, was increased by knockdown of ADAM23. In addition, lung metastasis of A549 transfectants with different levels of ADAM23 expression was negatively regulated by the ADAM23 expression levels. Our data provide evidence that ADAM23 plays a role in suppression of cancer cell progression through interaction with αvβ3 integrin, and suggest that downregulation of ADAM23 in SP cells may contribute toward providing a cancer stem cell phenotype by facilitating the activity of integrin αvβ3.",1

26796671,"Emerging gene-editing technologies are nearing a revolutionary phase in genetic medicine: precisely modifying or repairing causal genetic defects. This may include any number of DNA sequence manipulations, such as knocking out a deleterious gene, introducing a particular mutation, or directly repairing a defective sequence by site-specific recombination. All of these edits can currently be achieved via programmable rare-cutting endonucleases to create targeted DNA breaks that can engage and exploit endogenous DNA repair pathways to impart site-specific genetic changes. Over the past decade, several distinct technologies for introducing site-specific DNA breaks have been developed, yet the different biological origins of these gene-editing technologies bring along inherent differences in parameters that impact clinical implementation. This review aims to provide an accessible overview of the various endonuclease-based gene-editing platforms, highlighting the strengths and weakness of each with respect to therapeutic applications.",0
26787476,"Mammalian hibernators experience physiological extremes, e.g. ischemia, muscle disuse and hypothermia, which are lethal to non-hibernators, implying the existence of underlying mechanisms that allow hibernators to withstand these physiological extremes. Increased cell proliferation is suggested to be such a strategy, but its molecular basis remains unknown. In this study, we characterized the expression pattern of ZBED1 (zinc finger, BED-type containing 1), a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation, in five tissues of the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) during pre-hibernation, deep hibernation and post-hibernation. Moreover, we investigated the ZBED1 genetic divergence from individuals with variable hibernation phenotypes that cover all three known mtDNA lineages of the species. Expression analyses showed that ZBED1 is overexpressed only in brain and skeletal muscle, not in the other three tissues, suggesting an increased cell proliferation in these two tissues during deep hibernation. Evolutionary analyses showed that ZBED1 sequences were clustered into two well-supported clades with each one dominated by hibernating and non-hibernating individuals, respectively. Positive selection analyses further showed some positively selected sites and a divergent selection pressure among hibernating and non-hibernating groups of R. ferrumequinum. Our results suggest that ZBED1 as a potential candidate gene that regulates cell proliferation for hibernators to face physiological extremes during hibernation.",1
26780541,"In up to 30% of patients with colorectal adenomatous polyposis, no germline mutation in the known genes APC, causing familial adenomatous polyposis, MUTYH, causing MUTYH-associated polyposis, and POLE or POLD1, causing Polymerase-Proofreading-associated polyposis can be identified, although a hereditary etiology is likely. To uncover new causative genes, exome sequencing was performed using DNA from leukocytes and a total of 12 colorectal adenomas from seven unrelated patients with unexplained sporadic adenomatous polyposis. For data analysis and variant filtering, an established bioinformatics pipeline including in-house tools was applied. Variants were filtered for rare truncating point mutations and copy-number variants assuming a dominant, recessive, or tumor suppressor model of inheritance. Subsequently, targeted sequence analysis of the most promising candidate genes was performed in a validation cohort of 191 unrelated patients. All relevant variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. The analysis of exome sequencing data resulted in the identification of rare loss-of-function germline mutations in three promising candidate genes (DSC2, PIEZO1, ZSWIM7). In the validation cohort, further variants predicted to be pathogenic were identified in DSC2 and PIEZO1. According to the somatic mutation spectra, the adenomas in this patient cohort follow the classical pathways of colorectal tumorigenesis. The present study identified three candidate genes which might represent rare causes for a predisposition to colorectal adenoma formation. Especially PIEZO1 (FAM38A) and ZSWIM7 (SWS1) warrant further exploration. To evaluate the clinical relevance of these genes, investigation of larger patient cohorts and functional studies are required.",1
26772908,"The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is composed of three homologous subunits and allows the flow of Na(+) ions across high resistance epithelia, maintaining body salt and water homeostasis. ENaC dependent reabsorption of Na(+) in the kidney tubules regulates extracellular fluid (ECF) volume and blood pressure by modulating osmolarity. In multi-ciliated cells, ENaC is located in cilia and plays an essential role in the regulation of epithelial surface liquid volume necessary for cilial transport of mucus and gametes in the respiratory and reproductive tracts respectively. The subunits that form ENaC (named as alpha, beta, gamma and delta, encoded by genes SCNN1A, SCNN1B, SCNN1G, and SCNN1D) are members of the ENaC/Degenerin superfamily. The earliest appearance of ENaC orthologs is in the genomes of the most ancient vertebrate taxon, Cyclostomata (jawless vertebrates) including lampreys, followed by earliest representatives of Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates) including cartilaginous sharks. Among Euteleostomi (bony vertebrates), Actinopterygii (ray finned-fishes) branch has lost ENaC genes. Yet, most animals in the Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish) branch including Tetrapoda, amphibians and amniotes (lizards, crocodiles, birds, and mammals), have four ENaC paralogs. We compared the sequences of ENaC orthologs from 20 species and established criteria for the identification of ENaC orthologs and paralogs, and their distinction from other members of the ENaC/Degenerin superfamily, especially ASIC family. Differences between ENaCs and ASICs are summarized in view of their physiological functions and tissue distributions. Structural motifs that are conserved throughout vertebrate ENaCs are highlighted. We also present a comparative overview of the genotype-phenotype relationships in inherited diseases associated with ENaC mutations, including multisystem pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA1B), Liddle syndrome, cystic fibrosis-like disease and essential hypertension.",1
26763881,"Previous reports including genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have described associations of serum lipids with genomic variations. In the present study, we examined the association of ∼2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 3041 Japanese healthy volunteers obtained from the Japan Pharmacogenomics Data Science Consortium (JPDSC) database with serum lipids. We confirmed the previously reported associations of 14 SNPs in 5 regions for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, 23 SNPs in 12 regions for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 16 SNPs in 6 regions for triglyceride and 5 SNPs in 1 region for phospholipid. Furthermore, we identified 16 possible novel candidate genes associated with LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol or triglycerides, where SNPs had P-values of <1 × 10(-5). Further replication analyses of these genes with Korean data revealed significant associations of SNPs located within the PCSK7 gene and triglyceride (Pmeta=7.98 × 10(-9) and 1.91 × 10(-8) for rs508487 and rs236911, respectively). These associations remained significant even by the conditional analysis adjusting for three neighboring variations associated with triglyceride. Our present data suggest that PCSK7 as well as PCSK9 may be associated with lipids, especially triglyceride, and may serve as a candidate for a new drug target to treat lipid abnormality syndromes.",1

26752167,"Cigarette smoking has been shown to be a health hazard. In addition to being considered a negative lifestyle behavior, studies have shown that cigarette smoking has been linked to genetic underpinnings of hypertension. Because African Americans have the highest incidence and prevalence of hypertension, we examined the joint effect of genetics and cigarette smoking on health among this understudied population. The sample included African Americans from the genome wide association studies of HyperGEN (N = 1083, discovery sample) and GENOA (N = 1427, replication sample), both part of the FBPP. Results suggested that 2 SNPs located on chromosomes 14 (NEDD8; rs11158609; raw p = 9.80 × 10(-9), genomic control-adjusted p = 2.09 × 10(-7)) and 17 (TTYH2; rs8078051; raw p = 6.28 × 10(-8), genomic control-adjusted p = 9.65 × 10(-7)) were associated with SBP including the genetic interaction with cigarette smoking. These two SNPs were not associated with SBP in a main genetic effect only model. This study advances knowledge in the area of main and joint effects of genetics and cigarette smoking on hypertension among African Americans and offers a model to the reader for assessing these risks. More research is required to determine how these genes play a role in expression of hypertension.",1
26733164,"ATP-binding cassette E1 (ABCE1) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporters and regulates a broad range of biological functions including viral infection, cell proliferation, and anti-apoptosis. We have previously shown that ABCE1 is a prognostic indicator for lung cancer, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate whether the ABCE1 gene contributes to the malignancy of lung tumors, we introduced ABCE1 into LTEP-a-2 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Ectopic ABCE1 expression promoted clonogenicity and anchorage-independent growth of LTEP-a-2 cells, while in a mouse xenograft tumor model, it had an augmentative effect on tumor growth and metastasis and reduced the expression of the tumor-suppressor gene growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45α (GADD45α). Moreover, apoptosis was not significantly influenced by ABCE1 in vitro. In summary, we have provided evidence that ABCE1 plays an essential role in the progression and metastasis of lung cancers and may represent a valuable therapeutic target for the management of lung tumor.",1
26733130,"Bone mineral density (BMD) is a measure of osteoporosis and is useful in evaluating the risk of fracture. In a genome-wide association study of BMD among 20,100 Icelanders, with follow-up in 10,091 subjects of European and East-Asian descent, we found a new BMD locus that harbours the PTCH1 gene, represented by rs28377268 (freq. 11.4-22.6%) that associates with reduced spine BMD (P=1.0 × 10(-11), β=-0.09). We also identified a new spine BMD signal in RSPO3, rs577721086 (freq. 6.8%), that associates with increased spine BMD (P=6.6 × 10(-10), β=0.14). Importantly, both variants associate with osteoporotic fractures and affect expression of the PTCH1 and RSPO3 genes that is in line with their influence on BMD and known biological function of these genes. Additional new BMD signals were also found at the AXIN1 and SOST loci and a new lead SNP at the EN1 locus.",1
26729027,"The Abelson tyrosine kinases were initially identified as drivers of leukemia in mice and humans. The Abl family kinases Abl1 and Abl2 regulate diverse cellular processes during development and normal homeostasis, and their functions are subverted during inflammation, cancer and other pathologies. Abl kinases can be activated by multiple stimuli leading to cytoskeletal reorganization required for cell morphogenesis, motility, adhesion and polarity. Depending on the cellular context, Abl kinases regulate cell survival and proliferation. Emerging data support important roles for Abl kinases in pathologies linked to inflammation. Among these are neurodegenerative diseases and inflammatory pathologies. Unexpectedly, Abl kinases have also been identified as important players in mammalian host cells during microbial pathogenesis. Thus, the use of Abl kinase inhibitors might prove to be effective in the treatment of pathologies beyond leukemia and solid tumors. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and in the accompanying poster, we highlight the emerging roles of Abl kinases in the regulation of cellular processes in normal cells and diverse pathologies ranging from cancer to microbial pathogenesis.",1
26698646,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide because of metastasis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is widely considered to be crucial to the invasion-metastasis cascade during cancer progression. Actin-like 6A (ACTL6A) is initially verified important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In this study, we find that ACTL6A plays an essential role in metastasis and EMT of HCC. ACTL6A expression is up-regulated in HCC cells and tissues. A high level of ACTL6A in HCCs is correlated with aggressive clinicopathological features and is an independent poor prognostic factor for overall and disease-free survival of HCC patients. Ectopic expression of ACTL6A markedly promotes HCC cells migration, invasion, as well as EMT in vitro and promotes tumor growth and metastasis in the mouse xenograft model. Opposite results are observed when ACTL6A is knocked down. Mechanistically, ACTL6A promotes metastasis and EMT through activating Notch signaling. ACTL6A knockdown has the equal blockage effect as the Notch signaling inhibitor, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butylester, in HCC cells. Further studies indicate that ACTL6A might manipulate SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2) expression and then activate Notch1 signaling.",1
26697963,"Neuroinflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide range of neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. For over 20 years, (11)C-PK11195 PET, which aims to image expression of the translocator protein (TSPO) on activated microglia in the brain, has been used in preclinical and clinical research to investigate neuroinflammation in vivo in patients with brain diseases. However, (11)C-PK11195 suffers from two major limitations: its low brain permeability and high nonspecific and plasma binding results in a low signal-to-noise ratio, and the use of (11)C restricts its use to PET research centers and hospitals with an on-site cyclotron. In recent years, there has been a great deal of work into the development of new TSPO-specific PET radiotracers. This work has focused on fluorinated radiotracers, which would enable wider use and improved signal-to-noise ratios. These radiotracers have been utilized in preclinical and clinical studies of several neurologic diseases with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, the application of these second-generation TSPO radiotracers has revealed additional problems, including a polymorphism that affects TSPO binding. In this review, the developments in TSPO imaging are discussed, and current limitations and suggestions for future directions are explored.",1
26693737,"Study of the relationship between the structural and functional organization of proteins and their coding genes is necessary for an understanding of the evolution of molecular systems and can provide new knowledge for many applications for designing proteins with improved medical and biological properties. It is well known that the functional properties of proteins are determined by their functional sites. Functional sites are usually represented by a small number of amino acid residues that are distantly located from each other in the amino acid sequence. They are highly conserved within their functional group and vary significantly in structure between such groups. According to this facts analysis of the general properties of the structural organization of the functional sites at the protein level and, at the level of exon-intron structure of the coding gene is still an actual problem.",0
26690594,"Defects in genes that have role in apoptotic pathways result in development of Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS) and ALPS related disorders. Germline and somatic FAS mutations, FASL and CASP10 mutations constitute other genetic defects in ALPS. Patients who fulfill ALPS diagnostic criteria and do not have any identified known disease causing mutations are classified as ALPS-unknown or ALPS phenotype and comprise about one third of all patients. CASP8, NRAS and KRAS gene mutations were reported for ALPS related diseases. We performed DNA sequence analysis in 25 unrelated patients with probable ALPS for FAS, FASL and CASP8 gene defects. Pathogenic mutations could not be found in the FAS, FASL and CASP8 genes. However, we found that the frequencies of SNPs rs2234978 and rs1045487 of FAS and CASP8 genes were significantly higher in the patients. Our results suggest that CASP8 and FAS gene polymorphisms in particular, may contribute to the susceptibility to development of ALPS phenotype.",1
26686863,"Recombinant DNA technology and new material concepts are shaping future directions in biomaterial science for the design and production of the next-generation biomaterial platforms. Aside from conventionally used synthetic polymers, numerous natural biopolymers (e.g., silk, elastin, collagen, gelatin, alginate, cellulose, keratin, chitin, polyhydroxyalkanoates) have been investigated for properties and manipulation via bioengineering. Genetic engineering provides a path to increase structural and functional complexity of these biopolymers, and thereby expand the catalog of available biomaterials beyond that which exists in nature. In addition, the integration of experimental approaches with computational modeling to analyze sequence-structure-function relationships is starting to have an impact in the field by establishing predictive frameworks for determining material properties. Herein, we review advances in recombinant DNA-mediated protein production and functionalization approaches, with a focus on hybrids or combinations of proteins; recombinant protein blends or 'recombinamers'. We highlight the potential biomedical applications of fibrous protein recombinamers, such as Silk-Elastin Like Polypeptides (SELPs) and Silk-Bacterial Collagens (SBCs). We also discuss the possibility for the rationale design of fibrous proteins to build smart, stimuli-responsive biomaterials for diverse applications. We underline current limitations with production systems for these proteins and discuss the main trends in systems/synthetic biology that may improve recombinant fibrous protein design and production.",0
26662454,"The cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin genes are attractive candidates for neurodegenerative disorders given their functional role in retrograde transport along neurons. The cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (DYNC1H1) gene has been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders, and dynactin 1 (DCTN1) genes have been implicated in a wide spectrum of disorders including motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy and hereditary spastic paraplegia. However, the involvement of other dynactin genes with inherited peripheral neuropathies (IPN) namely, hereditary sensory neuropathy, hereditary motor neuropathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is under reported. We screened eight genes; DCTN1-6 and ACTR1A and ACTR1B in 136 IPN patients using whole-exome sequencing and high-resolution melt (HRM) analysis. Eight non-synonymous variants (including one novel variant) and three synonymous variants were identified. Four variants have been reported previously in other studies, however segregation analysis within family members excluded them from causing IPN in these families. No variants of disease significance were identified in this study suggesting the dynactin genes are unlikely to be a common cause of IPNs. However, with the ease of querying gene variants from exome data, these genes remain worthwhile candidates to assess unsolved IPN families for variants that may affect the function of the proteins.",1
26647728,"The landscape of genetic alterations in lung adenocarcinoma derived from Asian patients is largely uncharacterized. Here we present an integrated genomic and transcriptomic analysis of 335 primary lung adenocarcinomas and 35 corresponding lymph node metastases from Chinese patients. Altogether 13 significantly mutated genes are identified, including the most commonly mutated gene TP53 and novel mutation targets such as RHPN2, GLI3 and MRC2. TP53 mutations are furthermore significantly enriched in tumours from patients harbouring metastases. Genes regulating cytoskeleton remodelling processes are also frequently altered, especially in metastatic samples, of which the high expression level of IQGAP3 is identified as a marker for poor prognosis. Our study represents the first large-scale sequencing effort on lung adenocarcinoma in Asian patients and provides a comprehensive mutational landscape for both primary and metastatic tumours. This may thus form a basis for personalized medical care and shed light on the molecular pathogenesis of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.",1
26634513,"Recent genome-wide association studies have identified many loci associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hyperuricemia, and obesity in various ethnic populations. However, quantitative traits have been less well investigated in Han Chinese T2DM populations. We investigated the association between candidate gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and metabolic syndrome-related quantitative traits in Han Chinese T2DM subjects. Unrelated Han Chinese T2DM patients (1975) were recruited. Eighty-six SNPs were genotyped and tested for association with quantitative traits including lipid profiles, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), serum uric acid (SUA), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), plasma glucose [fasting plasma glucose (FPG)], plasma glucose 120 min post-OGTT (P2PG; OGTT = oral glucose tolerance test), and insulin resistance-related traits. We found that CAMTA1, ABI2, VHL, KAT2B, PKHD1, ESR1, TOX, SLC30A8, SFI1, and MYH9 polymorphisms were associated with HbA1c, FPG, and/or P2PG; GCK, HHEX, TCF7L2, KCNQ1, and TBX5 polymorphisms were associated with insulin resistance-related traits; ABCG2, SLC2A9, and PKHD1 polymorphisms were associated with SUA; CAMTA1, VHL, KAT2B, PON1, NUB1, SLITRK5, SMAD3, FTO, FANCA, and PCSK2 polymorphisms were associated with blood lipid traits; CAMTA1, SPAG16, TOX, KCNQ1, ACACB, and MYH9 polymorphisms were associated with blood pressure; and UBE2E3, SPAG16, SLC2A9, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, TCF7L2, SMAD3, and PNPLA3 polymorphisms were associated with BMI (all P values <0.05). Some of the candidate genes were associated with metabolic and anthropometric traits in T2DM in Han Chinese. Although none of these associations reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-8)), genes and loci identified in this study are worthy of further replication and investigation.",1
26631228,"Historically, genetic engineering for mammalian reproductive questions has been accomplished primarily in the mouse. However, all the genetic manipulations that can be done in the mouse can now be accomplished in most domesticated mammals. Random integration of transgenes, homologous recombination and gene editing are now routine for several mammalian species. For livestock, queries related to fertility can be asked directly for the species in question, without a need for a mouse model. For human clinical concerns, the most appropriate model should be selected based on physiology, anatomy, or even size. The mouse will continue to be a useful genetically engineered model. However, other species are now amenable to the full range of genetic manipulations and should be considered as possible models for human conditions when appropriate.",0
26626937,"Rapid development and increasing popularity of gene expression microarrays have resulted in a number of studies on the discovery of co-regulated genes. One important way of discovering such co-regulations is the query-based search since gene co-expressions may indicate a shared role in a biological process. Although there exist promising query-driven search methods adapting clustering, they fail to capture many genes that function in the same biological pathway because microarray datasets are fraught with spurious samples or samples of diverse origin, or the pathways might be regulated under only a subset of samples. On the other hand, a class of clustering algorithms known as biclustering algorithms which simultaneously cluster both the items and their features are useful while analyzing gene expression data, or any data in which items are related in only a subset of their samples. This means that genes need not be related in all samples to be clustered together. Because many genes only interact under specific circumstances, biclustering may recover the relationships that traditional clustering algorithms can easily miss. In this chapter, we briefly summarize the literature using biclustering for querying co-regulated genes. Then we present a novel biclustering approach and evaluate its performance by a thorough experimental analysis.",0

26601739,"Multiple genetic variants have been linked to risk of Parkinson disease (PD), but known mutations do not explain a large proportion of the total PD cases. Similarly, multiple loci have been associated with PD risk by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The influence that genetic factors confer on phenotypic diversity remains unclear. Few studies have been performed to determine whether the GWAS loci are also associated with age at onset (AAO) or motor progression. We used 2 PD case-control data sets (Washington University and the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative) to determine whether polymorphisms located at the GWAS top hits (GBA, ACMSD/TMEM163, STK39, MCCC1/LAMP3, GAK/TMEM175, SNCA, and MAPT) show association with AAO or motor progression. We found associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms at the GBA and MAPT loci and PD AAO and progression. These findings reinforce the complex genetic basis of PD and suggest that distinct genes and variants explain the genetic architecture of PD risk, onset, and progression.",1
26598881,"This author (A.I.) has witnessed the introduction of the Nutrition Care Process (NCP) and its subsequent adjustment over 10 y of her career in an acute and critical setting. A.I. observed that the NCP went through several revisions to better suit the actual clinical practices and the NCP was gradually incorporated into everyday work and accepted in a clinical setting. The NCP helped ensure that all practicing registered dietitians (RDs, RDNs) have up-to-date skill sets. The NCP is a systematic problem-solving tool with four distinct and interrelated steps that help RDs to improve critical thinking and address practice-related problems so that RDs can more effectively intervene and evaluate. In summary, RDs using the NCP are producing consistent and easy-to-read documentation of clinical practices that benefit other healthcare members. The intention to provide diagnosis-oriented assessment and to treat nutrition problems with intervention plans opens up opportunities for communication within healthcare teams and clients. The best practice requires interactive and ongoing communication with healthcare teams and clients. The NCP has resulted in improved productivity as the RDs are writing diagnosis- focused documentation with specific plans for intervention. In addition, analysis of common problems and nutrition diagnoses resolution rates appear to be in process in some facilities and may further promote RD roles in practice settings. In conclusion, the NCP is an effective tool to provide improved nutrition care.",0
26560889,"Studies had found that bacterial genes are preferentially located on the leading strands. Subsequently, the preferences of essential genes and highly expressed genes were compared by classifying all genes into four groups, which showed that the former has an exclusive influence on orientation. However, only some functional classes of essential genes have this orientation bias. Nevertheless, previous studies only performed comparative analyzes by differentiating the orientation bias extent of two types of genes. Thus, it is unclear whether the influence of essentiality on strand bias works continuously. Herein, we found a significant correlation between essentiality and orientation bias extent in 19 of 21 analyzed bacterial genomes, based on quantitative measurement of gene essentiality (or fitness). The correlation coefficient was much higher than that derived from binary essentiality measures (essential or non-essential). This suggested that genes with relatively lower essentiality, i.e., conditionally essential genes, also have some orientation bias, although it is weaker than that of absolutely essential genes. The results demonstrated the continuous influence of essentiality on orientation bias and provided details on this visible structural feature of bacterial genomes. It also proved that Geptop and IFIM could serve as useful resources of bacterial gene essentiality, particularly for quantitative analysis.",0
26516778,"Hypertension is a major risk factor for a spectrum of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including myocardial infarction, sudden death, and stroke. In the US, over 65 million people have high blood pressure and a large proportion of these individuals are prescribed antihypertensive medications. Although large long-term clinical trials conducted in the last several decades have identified a number of effective antihypertensive treatments that reduce the risk of future clinical complications, responses to therapy and protection from cardiovascular events vary among individuals.",0
26510302,"The functional classification of genes plays a vital role in molecular biology. Detecting previously unknown role of genes and their products in physiological and pathological processes is an important and challenging problem. In this work, information from several biological sources such as comparative genome sequences, gene expression and protein interactions are combined to obtain robust results on predicting gene functions. The information in such heterogeneous sources is often incomplete and hence making the maximum use of all the available information is a challenging problem. We propose an algorithm that improves the performance of prediction of different models built on individual sources. We also develop a heterogeneous boosting framework that uses all the available information even if some sources do not provide any information about some of the genes. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods in terms of accuracy and F-measure compared to several imputation and integration schemes.",0
26505445,"The genes of top athletes are a valuable genetic resource for the human race, and could be exploited to identify novel genes related to sports ability, as well as other functions. We analyzed the expressed sequence tags from top half-pipe snowboarding athletes using the SMART complementary DNA (cDNA) library construction method to elucidate the characteristics of the athlete genome and the differential expression of the genes it contains. Overall, we established a full-length cDNA library from the lymphocytes of half-pipe snowboarding athletes and analyzed the inserted gene fragments. We also classified those genes according to molecular function, biological characteristics, cellular composition, protein types, and signal paths. A total of 201 functional genes were noted, which were distributed in 27 pathways. TXN, MDH1, ARL1, ARPC3, ACTG1, and other genes measured in sequence may be associated with physical ability. This suggests that the SMART cDNA library constructed from the genetic material from top athletes is an effective tool for preserving genetic sports resources and providing genetic markers of physical ability for athlete selection.",1
26503763,"Lithium is the mainstay prophylactic treatment for bipolar disorder (BD), but treatment response varies considerably across individuals. Patients who respond well to lithium treatment might represent a relatively homogeneous subtype of this genetically and phenotypically diverse disorder. Here, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify (i) specific genetic variations influencing lithium response and (ii) genetic variants associated with risk for lithium-responsive BD. Patients with BD and controls were recruited from Sweden and the United Kingdom. GWAS were performed on 2698 patients with subjectively defined (self-reported) lithium response and 1176 patients with objectively defined (clinically documented) lithium response. We next conducted GWAS comparing lithium responders with healthy controls (1639 subjective responders and 8899 controls; 323 objective responders and 6684 controls). Meta-analyses of Swedish and UK results revealed no significant associations with lithium response within the bipolar subjects. However, when comparing lithium-responsive patients with controls, two imputed markers attained genome-wide significant associations, among which one was validated in confirmatory genotyping (rs116323614, P=2.74 × 10(-8)). It is an intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on chromosome 2q31.2 in the gene SEC14 and spectrin domains 1 (SESTD1), which encodes a protein involved in regulation of phospholipids. Phospholipids have been strongly implicated as lithium treatment targets. Furthermore, we estimated the proportion of variance for lithium-responsive BD explained by common variants ('SNP heritability') as 0.25 and 0.29 using two definitions of lithium response. Our results revealed a genetic variant in SESTD1 associated with risk for lithium-responsive BD, suggesting that the understanding of BD etiology could be furthered by focusing on this subtype of BD.",1
26503584,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple risk loci for testicular germ cell tumour (TGCT), revealing a polygenic model of disease susceptibility strongly influenced by common variation. To identify additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with TGCT, we conducted a multistage GWAS with a combined data set of >25,000 individuals (6,059 cases and 19,094 controls). We identified new risk loci for TGCT at 3q23 (rs11705932, TFDP2, P=1.5 × 10(-9)), 11q14.1 (rs7107174, GAB2, P=9.7 × 10(-11)), 16p13.13 (rs4561483, GSPT1, P=1.6 × 10(-8)) and 16q24.2 (rs55637647, ZFPM1, P=3.4 × 10(-9)). We additionally present detailed functional analysis of these loci, identifying a statistically significant relationship between rs4561483 risk genotype and increased GSPT1 expression in TGCT patient samples. These findings provide additional support for a polygenic model of TGCT risk and further insight into the biological basis of disease development.",1
26499779,"RRP12 (ribosomal RNA processing 12 homolog), a nucleolar protein, plays important roles in cell cycle progression and the response to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage in yeast cells. However, its role has not been investigated in mammalian cells that possess p53, which has close functional association to nucleolus. We explored the role of RRP12 in nucleolar stress condition using an osteosarcoma cell line, U2OS. To induce DNA damage and nucleolar disruption, two cytotoxic drugs, doxorubicin and actinomycin D were used. Cytotoxic stress resulted nucleolar disruption induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in U2OS cells. However, RRP12 overexpression promoted resistance to cytotoxic stress. In contrast, RRP12 silencing enhanced susceptibility to cytotoxic stress. During drug treatment, p53 activity and cell death were suppressed by RRP12 overexpression but promoted by RRP12 silencing. This study demonstrated that RRP12 was crucial for cell survival during cytotoxic stress via the repression of p53 stability. Thus, targeting RRP12 may enhance chemotherapeutic effect in cancers.",1
26493284,"Papillary hidradenoma (a.k.a. hidradenoma papilliferum) is a benign tumor of the anogenital region that almost exclusively arises in middle-aged Caucasian women. These tumors may recur and rare cases of malignant development have been reported. The genetic basis of papillary hidradenoma is currently unknown. Hence, we employed targeted high-coverage next generation sequencing interrogating 50 cancer-related genes and conventional Sanger sequencing to investigate the mutational landscape in a cohort of 15 cases. Additionally, we analyzed the HPV status of these tumors. Thirteen cases (87%) harbored mutations in cancer-related genes. Recurrent mutations in PIK3CA and AKT1 were present in 10 of the cases (67%). One PIK3CA mutated case had a concomitant STK11 mutation. Three cases harbored mutually exclusive mutations in BRAF, APC and ERBB4. The remaining two cases showed no mutations. None of the cases harbored DNA of human papilloma virus. Our results also provide evidence that--just as BRAF V600E mutations in hyperplastic polyps and benign nevi- a mutated driver gene does not imply malignant behavior per se but may set the basis for malignant transformation. The latter point may explain why rare cases of papillary hidradenoma have been reported to take a malignant course. Lastly, our genetic data may suggest treatment avenues beyond conventional surgery for some of these tumors.",1
26485283,"Ovarian development and maintenance are poorly understood; however, diseases that affect these processes can offer insights into the underlying mechanisms. XX female gonadal dysgenesis (XX-GD) is a rare, genetically heterogeneous disorder that is characterized by underdeveloped, dysfunctional ovaries, with subsequent lack of spontaneous pubertal development, primary amenorrhea, uterine hypoplasia, and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Here, we report an extended consanguineous family of Palestinian origin, in which 4 females exhibited XX-GD. Using homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing, we identified a recessive missense mutation in nucleoporin-107 (NUP107, c.1339G>A, p.D447N). This mutation segregated with the XX-GD phenotype and was not present in available databases or in 150 healthy ethnically matched controls. NUP107 is a component of the nuclear pore complex, and the NUP107-associated protein SEH1 is required for oogenesis in Drosophila. In Drosophila, Nup107 knockdown in somatic gonadal cells resulted in female sterility, whereas males were fully fertile. Transgenic rescue of Drosophila females bearing the Nup107D364N mutation, which corresponds to the human NUP107 (p.D447N), resulted in almost complete sterility, with a marked reduction in progeny, morphologically aberrant eggshells, and disintegrating egg chambers, indicating defective oogenesis. These results indicate a pivotal role for NUP107 in ovarian development and suggest that nucleoporin defects may play a role in milder and more common conditions such as premature ovarian failure.",1
26453985,"Evolutionary ecologists are traditionally gene-focused, as genes propagate phenotypic traits across generations and mutations and recombination in the DNA generate genetic diversity required for evolutionary processes. As a consequence, the inheritance of changed DNA provides a molecular explanation for the functional changes associated with natural selection. A direct focus on proteins on the other hand, the actual molecular agents responsible for the expression of a phenotypic trait, receives far less interest from ecologists and evolutionary biologists. This is partially due to the central dogma of molecular biology that appears to define proteins as the 'dead-end of molecular information flow' as well as technical limitations in identifying and studying proteins and their diversity in the field and in many of the more exotic genera often favored in ecological studies. Here we provide an overview of a newly forming field of research that we refer to as 'Evolutionary Proteomics'. We point out that the origins of cellular function are related to the properties of polypeptide and RNA and their interactions with the environment, rather than DNA descent, and that the critical role of horizontal gene transfer in evolution is more about coopting new proteins to impact cellular processes than it is about modifying gene function. Furthermore, post-transcriptional and post-translational processes generate a remarkable diversity of mature proteins from a single gene, and the properties of these mature proteins can also influence inheritance through genetic and perhaps epigenetic mechanisms. The influence of post-transcriptional diversification on evolutionary processes could provide a novel mechanistic underpinning for elements of rapid, directed evolutionary changes and adaptations as observed for a variety of evolutionary processes. Modern state-of the art technologies based on mass spectrometry are now available to identify and quantify peptides, proteins, protein modifications and protein interactions of interest with high accuracy and assess protein diversity and function. Therefore, proteomic technologies can be viewed as providing evolutionary biologist with exciting novel opportunities to understand very early events in functional variation of cellular molecular machinery that are acting as part of evolutionary processes.",0
26448680,"Every time we communicate our science, we are involuntarily involved in an educational activity, affecting the listeners' methodology and motivation. In a beautiful metaphor, late Nobel Laureate, Richard E. Smalley compared interacting atoms and molecules to boys and girls falling in love. Elaborated and exemplified with a couple of entertaining analogies in this discourse is the effectiveness of the use of metaphors in illustrating scientific concepts to both scientific novices and peers. Human brain has been considered to be a complex neural circuitry for the computation of metaphors, which explains the naturalness of their usage, especially when solid arguments could be given in support of the thesis that scientific imagery in general presents a collection of mathematically operable metaphors. On top of this, knowledge could be enriched through logic alone, but new concepts could be learned only through analogies. The greater pervasion of metaphors in scientific presentations could boost their inspirational potential, make the audience more attentive and receptive to their contents, and, finally, expand their educational prospect and enable their outreach to a far broader audience than it has been generally accomplished.",0
26446156,"The only documented activity of a subclass of ADAMTS proteases comprising ADAMTS2, 3 and 14 is the cleavage of the aminopropeptide of fibrillar procollagens. A limited number of in vitro studies suggested that ADAMTS3 is mainly responsible for procollagen II processing in cartilage. Here, we created an ADAMTS3 knockout mouse (Adamts3(-/-)) model to determine in vivo the actual functions of ADAMTS3. Heterozygous Adamts3(+/-) mice were viable and fertile, but their intercrosses demonstrated lethality of Adamts3(-/-) embryos after 15 days of gestation. Procollagens I, II and III processing was unaffected in these embryos. However, a massive lymphedema caused by the lack of lymphatics development, an abnormal blood vessel structure in the placenta and a progressive liver destruction were observed. These phenotypes are most probably linked to dysregulation of the VEGF-C pathways. This study is the first demonstration that an aminoprocollagen peptidase is crucial for developmental processes independently of its primary role in collagen biology and has physiological functions potentially involved in several human diseases related to angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.",1
26443244,"Research efforts in allergic rhinitis have always been intense. Over the past 3 years, numerous breakthroughs in basic science and clinical research have been made, augmenting our understanding of this condition that afflicts a significant proportion of the global population. New epidemiological findings, novel insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of allergy, enhancement of current developmental theories, new concepts of the goals and endpoints of management, and latest therapeutic modalities that includes the harnessing of information technology and big data are some areas where important advances were made. We attempt to bring you a summary of the key research advances made in the field of allergic rhinitis from 2013 to 2015.",0
26417939,"Proper placental development and function is crucial for a healthy pregnancy, and there has been substantial research to identify markers of placental dysfunction for the early detection of pregnancy complications. Low first-trimester levels of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 12 (ADAM12) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) have been consistently associated with the subsequent development of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. These molecules are both metalloproteinases secreted by the placenta that cleave insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs), although ADAM12 also has numerous other substrates. Recent work has identified ADAM12, and particularly its shorter variant, ADAM12S, as a regulator of the migration and invasion of trophoblasts into the lining of the uterus, a critical step in normal placental development. While the mechanisms underlying this regulation are not yet clear, they may involve the liberation of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) and/or IGFs from IGFBPs. In contrast, there has been relatively little functional work examining PAPP-A or the IGFBP substrates of ADAM12 and PAPP-A. Understanding the functions of these markers and the mechanisms underlying their association with disease could improve screening strategies and enable the development of new therapeutic interventions.",1

26401656,"Profiling amino acids and acylcarnitines in whole blood spots is a powerful tool in the laboratory diagnosis of several inborn errors of metabolism. Emerging data suggests that altered blood levels of amino acids and acylcarnitines are also associated with common metabolic diseases in adults. Thus, the identification of common genetic determinants for blood metabolites might shed light on pathways contributing to human physiology and common diseases. We applied a targeted mass-spectrometry-based method to analyze whole blood concentrations of 96 amino acids, acylcarnitines and pathway associated metabolite ratios in a Central European cohort of 2,107 adults and performed genome-wide association (GWA) to identify genetic modifiers of metabolite concentrations. We discovered and replicated six novel loci associated with blood levels of total acylcarnitine, arginine (both on chromosome 6; rs12210538, rs17657775), propionylcarnitine (chromosome 10; rs12779637), 2-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine (chromosome 21; rs1571700), stearoylcarnitine (chromosome 1; rs3811444), and aspartic acid traits (chromosome 8; rs750472). Based on an integrative analysis of expression quantitative trait loci in blood mononuclear cells and correlations between gene expressions and metabolite levels, we provide evidence for putative causative genes: SLC22A16 for total acylcarnitines, ARG1 for arginine, HLCS for 2-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine, JAM3 for stearoylcarnitine via a trans-effect at chromosome 1, and PPP1R16A for aspartic acid traits. Further, we report replication and provide additional functional evidence for ten loci that have previously been published for metabolites measured in plasma, serum or urine. In conclusion, our integrative analysis of SNP, gene-expression and metabolite data points to novel genetic factors that may be involved in the regulation of human metabolism. At several loci, we provide evidence for metabolite regulation via gene-expression and observed overlaps with GWAS loci for common diseases. These results form a strong rationale for subsequent functional and disease-related studies.",1
26394307,"Throughout the biological sciences, the past 15 years have seen a push toward the analysis and engineering of biological systems at the organism level. Given the complexity of even the simplest organisms, though, to elicit a phenotype of interest often requires genotypic manipulation of several loci. By traditional means, sequential editing of genomic targets requires a significant investment of time and labor, as the desired editing event typically occurs at a very low frequency against an overwhelming unedited background. In recent years, the development of a suite of new techniques has greatly increased editing efficiency, opening up the possibility for multiple editing events to occur in parallel. Termed as multiplexed genome engineering, this approach to genome editing has greatly expanded the scope of possible genome manipulations in diverse hosts, ranging from bacteria to human cells. The enabling technologies for multiplexed genome engineering include oligonucleotide-based and nuclease-based methodologies, and their application has led to the great breadth of successful examples described in this review. While many technical challenges remain, there also exists a multiplicity of opportunities in this rapidly expanding field.",0

26357005,"Oligodendrogliomas with combined loss of chromosome arms 1p and 19q are known to be particularly sensitive to chemotherapy, and the CIC gene located on 19q is known to be mutated in over 50% of the 1p/19q codeleted oligodendrogliomas. However, the role of CIC in the oligodendroglioma pathogenesis is not known. Exome sequencing of 11 oligodendroglial tumors identified 9 tumors with combined loss of 1p and 19q. Somatic mutations were found in the CIC and FUBP1 genes. Recurrent somatic mutations were also identified in the Notch signaling pathway genes NOTCH1 and MAML3, the chromatin modifying gene ARID1A and in KRAS. Comparison of the transcriptome profiles of CIC-mutant and CIC-wild type oligodendrogliomas from the study cohort as well as 65 1p/19q codeleted oligodendrogliomas from the TCGA cohort identified genes encoding the ETV transcription factor family to be significantly upregulated in the CIC-mutant tumors. Upregulation of a number of negative regulators of the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway like Sprouty and SPRED family members in the CIC-mutant oligodendrogliomas is likely due to the constitutive activation of the pathway resulting from inactive CIC protein. Higher expression of the oncogenic ETV transcription factors in the CIC-mutant oligodendrogliomas may make these tumors more aggressive than the CIC-wild type tumors.",1
26352407,"Genome-wide association studies with metabolic traits (mGWAS) uncovered many genetic variants that influence human metabolism. These genetically influenced metabotypes (GIMs) contribute to our metabolic individuality, our capacity to respond to environmental challenges, and our susceptibility to specific diseases. While metabolic homeostasis in blood is a well investigated topic in large mGWAS with over 150 known loci, metabolic detoxification through urinary excretion has only been addressed by few small mGWAS with only 11 associated loci so far. Here we report the largest mGWAS to date, combining targeted and non-targeted 1H NMR analysis of urine samples from 3,861 participants of the SHIP-0 cohort and 1,691 subjects of the KORA F4 cohort. We identified and replicated 22 loci with significant associations with urinary traits, 15 of which are new (HIBCH, CPS1, AGXT, XYLB, TKT, ETNPPL, SLC6A19, DMGDH, SLC36A2, GLDC, SLC6A13, ACSM3, SLC5A11, PNMT, SLC13A3). Two-thirds of the urinary loci also have a metabolite association in blood. For all but one of the 6 loci where significant associations target the same metabolite in blood and urine, the genetic effects have the same direction in both fluids. In contrast, for the SLC5A11 locus, we found increased levels of myo-inositol in urine whereas mGWAS in blood reported decreased levels for the same genetic variant. This might indicate less effective re-absorption of myo-inositol in the kidneys of carriers. In summary, our study more than doubles the number of known loci that influence urinary phenotypes. It thus allows novel insights into the relationship between blood homeostasis and its regulation through excretion. The newly discovered loci also include variants previously linked to chronic kidney disease (CPS1, SLC6A13), pulmonary hypertension (CPS1), and ischemic stroke (XYLB). By establishing connections from gene to disease via metabolic traits our results provide novel hypotheses about molecular mechanisms involved in the etiology of diseases.",1
26350623,"The Yin-Yang 2 (YY2) protein is the most recently described member of the family of YY transcription factors. Despite its high structural and functional homology with the well-characterized YY1, less is known about its role in biological processes. In previous studies, we have found differential yy2 mRNA expression levels in various cell types of the murine brain. To investigate the functional implication of yy2 in neurons, we have examined the influence of altered cellular yy2 concentrations during neuronal differentiation. Our results indicate that both the up- and down-regulation of yy2 significantly impairs the outgrowth of the major neurite of primary hippocampal neurons and the numbers of neuronal processes in proximate extensions. Moreover, enhanced expression of wild-type yy2 results in increased cell death, whereas elevated expression levels of a yy2 DNA-binding mutant have no effect on cell viability. Therefore, stringent regulation of the cellular yy2 content might be needed to ensure proper neurite outgrowth and cell vitality.",1
26350515,"Cerebral visual impairment (CVI) is a major cause of low vision in children due to impairment in projection and/or interpretation of the visual input in the brain. Although acquired causes for CVI are well known, genetic causes underlying CVI are largely unidentified. DNAs of 25 patients with CVI and intellectual disability, but without acquired (eg, perinatal) damage, were investigated by whole-exome sequencing. The data were analyzed for de novo, autosomal-recessive, and X-linked variants, and subsequently classified into known, candidate, or unlikely to be associated with CVI. This classification was based on the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database, literature reports, variant characteristics, and functional relevance of the gene. After classification, variants in four genes known to be associated with CVI (AHDC1, NGLY1, NR2F1, PGAP1) in 5 patients (20%) were identified, establishing a conclusive genetic diagnosis for CVI. In addition, in 11 patients (44%) with CVI, variants in one or more candidate genes were identified (ACP6, AMOT, ARHGEF10L, ATP6V1A, DCAF6, DLG4, GABRB2, GRIN1, GRIN2B, KCNQ3, KCTD19, RERE, SLC1A1, SLC25A16, SLC35A2, SOX5, UFSP2, UHMK1, ZFP30). Our findings show that diverse genetic causes underlie CVI, some of which will provide insight into the biology underlying this disease process.",1
26323669,"ADAM15 is a membrane-associated proteinase belonging to a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family. Recent studies suggested that ADAM15 is overexpressed in several types of cancer and is involved in metastatic tumor progression. However, the function of ADAM15 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is currently unknown. In the present study, we found that high expression of ADAM15 was associated with decreased overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in NSCLC patients. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated knockdown of ADAM15 attenuated cell migration and invasion. Mechanistic study demonstrated that ADAM15 upregulated MMP9 expression in lung cancer cells via activation of the MEK-ERK pathway. Moreover, ADAM15 proteolytically cleaved and activated pro-MMP9 in vitro and interacted with MMP9 in vivo. Overexpression of ADAM15 in A549 cells promoted cell invasion, while knocking down MMP9 attenuated cell invasive ability. Therefore, our data not only support a pro-metastatic role of ADAM15 in lung cancer progression, but also reveal a novel mechanism of ADAM15 in promoting cancer cell invasion through directly targeting MMP9 activation.",1
26316429,"Insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells is tightly regulated to keep fasting blood glucose concentrations within the normal range (3.5-5.5 mmol/L). Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (HH) is a heterozygous condition in which insulin secretion becomes unregulated and its production persists despite low blood glucose levels. It is the most common cause of severe and persistent hypoglycaemia in neonates and children. The most severe and permanent forms are due to congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI). Recent advances in genetics have linked CHI to mutations in 9 genes that play a key role in regulating insulin secretion (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HADH, SLC16A1, UCP2, HNF4A and HNF1A). Histologically, CHI can be divided into 3 types; diffuse, focal and atypical. Given the biochemical nature of HH (non-ketotic), a delay in the diagnosis and management can result in irreversible brain damage. Therefore, it is essential to diagnose and treat HH promptly. Advances in molecular genetics, imaging methods (18F-DOPA PET-CT), medical therapy and surgical approach (laparoscopic surgery) have completely changed the management and improved the outcome of these children. This review provides an overview of the genetic and molecular mechanisms leading to development of HH in children. The article summarizes the current diagnostic methods and management strategies for the different types of CHI.",1
26301083,"Mutations in the Alpha-actinin-4 gene (ACTN4) cause a rare form of familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in humans. Individuals with kidney disease-associated ACTN4 mutations tend to have mild to moderate proteinuria, with many developing decreased kidney function progressing to end stage kidney disease. All of the disease-causing ACTN4 mutations identified to date are located within the actin-binding domain of the encoded protein, increasing its binding affinity to F-actin and leading to abnormal actin rich cellular aggregates. The identification of ACTN4 mutations as a cause of human kidney disease demonstrates a key cellular pathway by which alterations in cytoskeletal behavior can mediate kidney disease. Here we review the studies relevant to ACTN4 and its role in mediating kidney disease.",1

Athletes are now educated about food fundamentals (acquiring foods, menu planning, preparing, food safety), personal accountability of hydration and energy monitoring (urinary and body weight assessments), individualized supplementation protocols, and customized nutrition for variable daily training environments according to their Yearly Training Plan. Sport dietitians are an important member of Integrated Sport Teams where collaboration exists amongst professionals who coordinate the athletes' personalized training and performance programming.

26252478,"Immunotherapy is emerging as a supplement to conventional cancer treatment, and identifying antigen targets for specific types of cancer is critical to optimizing therapeutic efficacy. Cancer/testis antigens are highly promising targets for immunotherapy due to their cancer-specific expression and antigenic properties, but the expression patterns of most of the more than 200 identified cancer/testis antigens in various cancers remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, we investigated the expression of the cancer/testis antigens ADAM2, CALR3 and SAGE1 in lung and breast cancer, the two most frequent human cancers, with the purpose of providing novel therapeutic targets for these diseases. We used a set of previously uncharacterized antibodies against the cancer/testis antigens ADAM2, CALR3 and SAGE1 to investigate their expression in a large panel of normal tissues as well as breast and lung cancers. Staining for the well-characterized MAGE-A proteins was included for comparison. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed previous mRNA analysis demonstrating that ADAM2, CALR3 and SAGE1 proteins are confined to testis in normal individuals. Negative tissues included plancenta, which express many other CT antigens, such as MAGE-A proteins. Surprisingly, we detected no ADAM2, CALR3 and SAGE1 in the 67 lung cancers (mainly non-small lung cancer) and 189 breast cancers, while MAGE-A proteins were present in 15% and 7-16% of these tumor types, respectively. Treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors has been proposed as an attractive strategy to increase the expression of cancer/testis antigens in tumors before immunotargeting; however, neither ADAM2, CALR3 nor SAGE1 could be significantly induced in lung and breast cancer cell lines using this strategy. Our results suggest that ADAM2, CALR3 and SAGE1 cancer/testis antigens are not promising targets for immunotherapy of breast and lung cancer.",1
26242992,"X-linked congenital cerebellar ataxia is a heterogeneous nonprogressive neurodevelopmental disorder with onset in early childhood. We searched for a genetic cause of this condition, previously reported in a Buryat pedigree of Mongolian ancestry from southeastern Russia. Using whole-genome sequencing on Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, we found a missense mutation in the ABCB7 (ABC-binding cassette transporter B7) gene, encoding a mitochondrial transporter, involved in heme synthesis and previously associated with sideroblastic anemia and ataxia. The mutation resulting in a substitution of a highly conserved glycine to serine in position 682 is apparently a major causative factor of the cerebellar hypoplasia/atrophy found in affected individuals of a Buryat family who had no evidence of sideroblastic anemia. Moreover, in these affected men we also found the genetic defects in two other genes closely linked to ABCB7 on chromosome X: a deletion of a genomic region harboring the second exon of copper-transporter gene (ATP7A) and a complete deletion of PGAM4 (phosphoglycerate mutase family member 4) retrogene located in the intronic region of the ATP7A gene. Despite the deletion, eliminating the first of six metal-binding domains in ATP7A, no signs for Menkes disease or occipital horn syndrome associated with ATP7A mutations were found in male carriers. The role of the PGAM4 gene has been previously implicated in human reproduction, but our data indicate that its complete loss does not disrupt male fertility. Our finding links cerebellar pathology to the genetic defect in ABCB7 and ATP7A structural variant inherited as X-linked trait, and further reveals the genetic heterogeneity of X-linked cerebellar disorders.",1
26239646,"Drug interaction studies on new drug applications (NDAs) for new molecular entities (NMEs) approved in Japan between 1997 and 2008 are examined in the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). The situations of drug interaction studies in NDAs have changed over the past 12 years, especially in metabolizing enzyme and transporter-based drug interactions. Materials and approaches to study drug-metabolizing enzyme-based drug interactions have improved, and become more rational based on mechanistic theory and new technologies. On the basis of incremental evidence of transporter roles in human pharmacokinetics, transporter-based drug interactions have been increasingly studied during drug development and submitted in recent NDAs. Some recently approved NMEs include transporter-based drug interaction information in their package inserts (PIs). The regulatory document ""Methods of Drug Interaction Studies,"" in addition to recent advances in science and technology, has also contributed to plan and evaluation of drug interaction studies in recent new drug development. This review summarizes current situations and further discussion points on drug interaction studies in NDAs in Japan.",0
26237329,"To better understand prostate function and disease, it is important to define and explore the molecular constituents that signify the prostate gland. The aim of this study was to define the prostate specific transcriptome and proteome, in comparison to 26 other human tissues. Deep sequencing of mRNA (RNA-seq) and immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling were combined to identify prostate specific gene expression patterns and to explore tissue biomarkers for potential clinical use in prostate cancer diagnostics. We identified 203 genes with elevated expression in the prostate, 22 of which showed more than five-fold higher expression levels compared to all other tissue types. In addition to previously well-known proteins we identified two poorly characterized proteins, TMEM79 and ACOXL, with potential to differentiate between benign and cancerous prostatic glands in tissue biopsies. In conclusion, we have applied a genome-wide analysis to identify the prostate specific proteome using transcriptomics and antibody-based protein profiling to identify genes with elevated expression in the prostate. Our data provides a starting point for further functional studies to explore the molecular repertoire of normal and diseased prostate including potential prostate cancer markers such as TMEM79 and ACOXL.",1
26235824,"We conducted a genome-wide association study of low bone mineral density (BMD) at the hip and spine utilizing sequence variants found through whole-genome sequencing of 2636 Icelanders. We found two rare missense mutations, p.Gly496Ala and p.Gly703Ser, in the COL1A2 gene that associate with measures of osteoporosis in Icelanders. Mutations in COL1A2 are known to cause the autosomal dominant disorder osteogenesis imperfecta. Both variants associate with low BMD and with osteoporotic fractures. p.Gly496Ala (frequency of 0.105%) shows the strongest association with low BMD at the spine (p = 1.8 × 10(-7) , odds ratio [OR] = 4.61 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.59, 8.18]), whereas p.Gly703Ser (frequency of 0.050%) is most strongly associated with low BMD at the hip (p = 1.9 × 10(-8) , OR = 9.34 [95% CI 4.28, 20.3]). Association with fractures was p = 2.2 × 10(-5) , OR = 3.75 (95% CI 2.03, 6.93) and p = 0.0023, OR = 4.32 (95% CI 1.69, 11.1), respectively. The carriers of these variants do not have signs of osteogenesis imperfecta other than low BMD, demonstrating that similar mutations in COL1A2 can affect skeletal phenotypes in more than one way.",1
26222560,"Familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer accounts for 3 to 9% of all cases of thyroid cancer, but the susceptibility genes are not known. Here, we report a germline variant of HABP2 in seven affected members of a kindred with familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer and in 4.7% of 423 patients with thyroid cancer. This variant was associated with increased HABP2 protein expression in tumor samples from affected family members, as compared with normal adjacent thyroid tissue and samples from sporadic cancers. Functional studies showed that HABP2 has a tumor-suppressive effect, whereas the G534E variant results in loss of function.",1
26220525,"Myb-Like, SWIRM, and MPN domains 1 (MYSM1) is a metalloprotease that deubiquitinates the K119-monoubiquitinated form of histone 2A (H2A), a chromatin marker associated with gene transcription silencing. Likewise, it has been reported that murine Mysm1 participates in transcription derepression of genes, among which are transcription factors involved in hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis, hematopoiesis, and lymphocyte differentiation. However, whether MYSM1 has a similar function in human subjects remains unclear. Here we describe a patient presenting with a complete lack of B lymphocytes, T-cell lymphopenia, defective hematopoiesis, and developmental abnormalities.",1
26214590,"We report on whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 213 melanomas. Our analysis established NF1, encoding a negative regulator of RAS, as the third most frequently mutated gene in melanoma, after BRAF and NRAS. Inactivating NF1 mutations were present in 46% of melanomas expressing wild-type BRAF and RAS, occurred in older patients and showed a distinct pattern of co-mutation with other RASopathy genes, particularly RASA2. Functional studies showed that NF1 suppression led to increased RAS activation in most, but not all, melanoma cases. In addition, loss of NF1 did not predict sensitivity to MEK or ERK inhibitors. The rebound pathway, as seen by the induction of phosphorylated MEK, occurred in cells both sensitive and resistant to the studied drugs. We conclude that NF1 is a key tumor suppressor lost in melanomas, and that concurrent RASopathy gene mutations may enhance its role in melanomagenesis.",1
26209012,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of still unknown etiology and the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Besides its main neuropathological hallmarks, a dysfunctional homeostasis of transition metals has been reported to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Dysregulation of iron (Fe) metabolism in AD has been suggested, particularly at the level of cellular iron efflux. Herein, we intended to further clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying Fe homeostasis in AD. In order to achieve this goal, the expression of specific Fe metabolism-related genes directly involved in Fe regulation and export was assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 73AD patients and 74 controls by quantitative PCR. The results obtained showed a significant decrease in the expression of aconitase 1 (ACO1; P=0.007); ceruloplasmin (CP; P<0.001) and amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP; P=0.006) genes in AD patients compared with healthy volunteers. These observations point out to a significant downregulation in the expression of genes associated with ferroportin-mediated cellular Fe export in PBMCs from AD patients, when compared to controls. Taken together, these findings support previous studies suggesting impairment of Fe homeostasis in AD, which may lead to cellular Fe retention and oxidative stress, a typical feature of this disease.",1
26203073,"In patients unable to tolerate oral intake, multiple options of nutrient delivery are available to the clinician. Administration of enteral nutrition (EN) has long been considered the standard of care for nutrition support among patients unable to meet energy and protein requirements orally. Healthcare practitioners must make careful decisions related to ordering, administering, and monitoring EN therapy. In the hospital setting, the registered dietitian is a key resource in enteral formula selection and method of administration, monitoring for and troubleshooting EN-related complications, and transitioning to oral feeding. The hospital setting also presents many unique challenges in providing optimal nutrition to the enterally fed patient.",1
26191264,"Gastric cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death partially because of its aggressive metastasis and the fact that it is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Recent studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in multiple biological processes including oncogenesis. In the present study, we found for the first time that the lncRNA ZMAT1 transcript variant 2 is downregulated in gastric cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues (P<0.001). The expression of ZMAT1 transcript variant 2 was inversely correlated with lymph node metastasis (P<0.05), depth of tumor invasion and tumor node metastasis stage (P<0.05). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that ZMAT1 transcript variant 2 expression was an independent predictor for overall survival (P<0.05). Our study suggests that ZMAT1 transcript variant 2 is a potential diagnostic factor in patients with gastric cancer.",1
26189150,"Drawing on data from the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) and employing multilevel modeling as an analytic strategy, this study examined the relations of adolescent children's perceptions of their parents' attitudes towards mathematics to their own attitudes towards mathematics and mathematics achievement among a sample of 5116 adolescents from 384 schools in the United Arab Emirates. The results of this cross-sectional study revealed that adolescents who perceived that their parents liked mathematics and considered mathematics was important for their children not only to study but also for their career tended to report higher levels of intrinsic and instrumental motivation to learn mathematics, mathematics self-concept and self-efficacy, and mathematics work ethic. Moreover, adolescents who perceived that their parents liked mathematics and considered mathematics was important for their children's career tended to report positive intentions and behaviors toward mathematics. However, adolescents who perceived that their parents considered mathematics was important for their children's career tended to report higher levels of mathematics anxiety. Finally, adolescents who perceived that their parents considered mathematics was important for their children to study performed significantly better on the mathematics assessment than did their peers whose parents disregarded the importance of learning mathematics.",0
26184070,"Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a frequent psychiatric disorder seen in children and adolescents with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ODD is also a common antecedent to both affective disorders and aggressive behaviors. Although the heritability of ODD has been estimated to be around 0.60, there has been little research into the molecular genetics of ODD. The present study examined the association of irritable and defiant/vindictive dimensions and categorical subtypes of ODD (based on latent class analyses) with previously described specific polymorphisms (DRD4 exon3 VNTR, 5-HTTLPR, and seven OXTR SNPs) as well as with dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin genes and pathways in a clinical sample of children and adolescents with ADHD. In addition, we performed a multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the aforementioned ODD dimensions and subtypes. Apart from adjusting the analyses for age and sex, we controlled for ""parental ability to cope with disruptive behavior."" None of the hypothesis-driven analyses revealed a significant association with ODD dimensions and subtypes. Inadequate parenting behavior was significantly associated with all ODD dimensions and subtypes, most strongly with defiant/vindictive behaviors. In addition, the GWAS did not result in genome-wide significant findings but bioinformatics and literature analyses revealed that the proteins encoded by 28 of the 53 top-ranked genes functionally interact in a molecular landscape centered around Beta-catenin signaling and involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of ODD and inform future genetic studies of oppositional behavior. © 2015 The Authors.

26154020,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most prevalent form of early onset dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD). We performed a case-control association study in an Italian FTD cohort (n = 530) followed by the novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)-to-genes approach and functional annotation analysis. We identified 2 novel potential loci for FTD. Suggestive SNPs reached p-values ∼10(-7) and odds ratio > 2.5 (2p16.3) and 1.5 (17q25.3). Suggestive alleles at 17q25.3 identified a disease-associated haplotype causing decreased expression of -cis genes such as RFNG and AATK involved in neuronal genesis and differentiation and axon outgrowth, respectively. We replicated this locus through the SNPs-to-genes approach. Our functional annotation analysis indicated significant enrichment for functions of the brain (neuronal genesis, differentiation, and maturation), the synapse (neurotransmission and synapse plasticity), and elements of the immune system, the latter supporting our recent international FTD-genome-wide association study. This is the largest genome-wide study in Italian FTD to date. Although our results are not conclusive, we set the basis for future replication studies and identification of susceptible molecular mechanisms involved in FTD pathogenesis.",1
26135634,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the global burden of ACD and its risk factors and to discuss the main challenges and opportunities for prevention. Publicly available data from the Global Burden of Disease Study were analyzed for ischemic heart disease (IHD), ischemic stroke and ACD risk factors. Data from the WHO Global Health Observatory were used to describe prevalence of diverse cardiometabolic risk factors. World Bank Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDPc) information was used to categorize countries according to income level. Cardiovascular mortality decreased globally from 1990-2010 with important differences by GDPc; during 1990 there was a positive association between IHD mortality and GDPc. Higher-income countries had higher rates compared to those of lower-income countries. High levels of body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol have a differential contribution to mortality by income group over time; high-income countries have been able to reduce the contribution from these risk factors in the last 20 years, whereas lower/middle income countries show an increasing trend in mortality attributable to high BMI and glucose. Although age-adjusted ACD mortality rate trends decreased globally, the absolute number of ACD deaths is increasing in part due to the growth of the population and aging, as well as to important lifestyle and food-system changes that likely attenuate gains in prevention. Population and individual level preventable causes of ACD must be aggressively and efficiently targeted in countries of lower economic development in order to reduce the growing burden of disease due to ACD.",1
26127003,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease in Chinese pediatric patients. To date, the genetic susceptibility to AD in this population has not been fully clarified. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms have previously been associated with AD in Europeans, rs2897442 (KIF3A), rs479844 (OVOL1) and rs2164983 (ACTL9). To verify the correlation between AD and these three SNPs in the Chinese pediatric population, we conducted a case-control study including 235 pediatric patients with AD and 200 health controls. We confirmed the correlation between rs2897442 and rs479844 and AD in this population at both the genotype and allele levels. Statistical analysis showed that the C allele of rs2897442 is associated with an increased risk of developing AD, while the A allele of rs479844 is associated with a reduced risk. No correlation between rs2164983 and AD was identified. Our study indicates that KIF3A and OVOL1 are involved in the development of AD in the Chinese pediatric population.",1
26115089,"ABCC9 genetic polymorphisms are associated with increased risk for various human diseases including hippocampal sclerosis of aging. The main goals of this study were 1 > to detect the ABCC9 variants and define the specific 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) for each variant in human brain, and 2 > to determine whether a polymorphism (rs704180) associated with risk for hippocampal sclerosis of aging pathology is also associated with variation in ABCC9 transcript expression and/or splicing. Rapid amplification of ABCC9 cDNA ends (3'RACE) provided evidence of novel 3' UTR portions of ABCC9 in human brain. In silico and experimental studies were performed focusing on the single nucleotide polymorphism, rs704180. Analyses from multiple databases, focusing on rs704180 only, indicated that this risk allele is a local expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL). Analyses of RNA from human brains showed increased ABCC9 transcript levels in individuals with the risk genotype, corresponding with enrichment for a shorter 3' UTR which may be more stable than variants with the longer 3' UTR. MicroRNA transfection experiments yielded results compatible with the hypothesis that miR-30c causes down-regulation of SUR2 transcripts with the longer 3' UTR. Thus we report evidence of complex ABCC9 genetic regulation in brain, which may be of direct relevance to human disease. ABCC9 gene variants are associated with increased risk for hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging--a prevalent brain disease with symptoms that mimic Alzheimer's disease). We describe novel ABCC9 variants in human brain, corresponding to altered 3'UTR length, which could lead to targeting by miR-30c. We also determined that the HS-Aging risk mutation is associated with variation in ABCC9 transcript expression.",1
26109344,"African-American (AA) women have higher breast cancer-specific mortality rates. A higher prevalence of the worse outcome Basal-like breast cancer subtype contributes to this, but AA women also have higher mortality even within the more favorable outcome Luminal A breast cancers. These differences may reflect treatment or health care access issues, inherent biological differences, or both. To identify potential biological differences by race among Luminal A breast cancers, gene expression data from 108 CAU and 57 AA breast tumors were analyzed. Race-associated genes were evaluated for associations with survival. Finally, expression of race- and survival-associated genes was evaluated in normal tissue of AA and CAU women. Six genes (ACOX2, MUC1, CRYBB2, PSPH, SQLE, TYMS) were differentially expressed by race among Luminal A breast cancers and were associated with survival (HR <0.8, HR >1.25). For all six genes, tumors in AA had higher expression of poor prognosis genes (CRYBB2, PSPH, SQLE, TYMS) and lower expression of good prognosis genes (ACOX2, MUC1). A score based on all six genes predicted survival in a large independent dataset (HR = 1.9 top vs. bottom quartile, 95% CI: 1.4-2.5). For four genes, normal tissue of AA and CAU women showed similar expression (ACOX2, MUC1, SQLE, TYMS); however, the poor outcome-associated genes CRYBB2 and PSPH were more highly expressed in AA versus CAU women's normal tissue. This analysis identified gene expression differences that may contribute to mortality disparities and suggests that among Luminal A breast tumors there are biological differences between AA and CAU patients. Some of these differences (CRYBB2 and PSPH) may exist from the earliest stages of tumor development, or may even precede malignancy.",1
26096009,"Liver cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-associated mortality. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the major histological subtype among types of primary liver cancer. China is an area of high incidence of HCC, and >50% of the cases of HCC worldwide are in China. At present, the mechanism underlying the development of HCC remains to be fully elucidated, and previous studies have predominantly focused on HCC in southern and eastern China, with molecular data of the HCC cases in Western China remains limited. In the present study, a panel of 372 cancer‑associated genes were screened using a next generation sequencing platform, which included a total of 12 cases from western China. The results confirmed mutations in previously identified HCC drivers, including p53 and Kras. Additionally, mutations in several cancer genes, which had not been previously associated with HCC, were identified, including RUNX1 and JAK3. The present study provided a mutation spectrum of HCC tissue in cases from western China, assisting in the investigation of the mechanism of liver carcinogenesis.",1

In the past decade, a plethora of powerful new DNA assembly methods - including Gibson Assembly, Golden Gate and ligase cycling reaction (LCR) - have been developed. In this Innovation article, we discuss these methods as well as standards such as the modular cloning (MoClo) system, GoldenBraid, modular overlap-directed assembly with linkers (MODAL) and PaperClip, which have been developed to facilitate a streamlined assembly workflow, to aid the exchange of material between research groups and to create modular reusable DNA parts.",0
26072434,"Differential gene expression is the basis for cell type diversity in multicellular organisms and the driving force of development and differentiation. It is achieved by cell type-specific transcriptional enhancers, which are genomic DNA sequences that activate the transcription of their target genes. Their identification and characterization is fundamental to our understanding of gene regulation. Features that are associated with enhancer activity, such as regulatory factor binding or histone modifications can predict the location of enhancers. Nonetheless, enhancer activity can only be assessed by transcriptional reporter assays. Over the past years massively parallel reporter assays have been developed for large scale testing of enhancers. In this review we focus on the principles and applications of STARR-seq, a functional assay that quantifies enhancer strengths in complex candidate libraries and thus allows activity-based enhancer identification in entire genomes. We explain how STARR-seq works, discuss current uses and give an outlook to future applications.",0
26061551,"The YPEL (Yippee-like) gene family comprises five highly conserved members (YPEL1-5), but their biological function remains largely unknown. Early studies of YPEL1 function suggested that it plays a role in the development of structures derived from the pharyngeal arches. Human YPEL1 localises to distal chromosome 22q11.2 and copy number changes at this locus lead to diverse phenotypes that include facial dysmorphism, facial asymmetry, and palatal anomalies comprising the distal 22q11.2 deletion/duplication syndromes (OMIM 611867). We therefore investigated the role of chick YPEL1 in craniofacial development using ex vivo and in vivo approaches in the avian model.",1

Serum levels of activin A were found to be elevated in pathological conditions such as cachexia, osteoporosis and cancer. Signaling by activin A through canonical ALK4-ACVR2 receptor complexes activates the transcription factors SMAD2 and SMAD3. Activin A has a strong affinity to type 2 receptors, a feature that they share with some of the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs).

26025392,"The ADAMTS (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs) enzymes are secreted, multi-domain matrix-associated zinc metalloendopeptidases that have diverse roles in tissue morphogenesis and patho-physiological remodeling, in inflammation and in vascular biology. The human family includes 19 members that can be sub-grouped on the basis of their known substrates, namely the aggrecanases or proteoglycanases (ADAMTS1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 15 and 20), the procollagen N-propeptidases (ADAMTS2, 3 and 14), the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein-cleaving enzymes (ADAMTS7 and 12), the von-Willebrand Factor proteinase (ADAMTS13) and a group of orphan enzymes (ADAMTS6, 10, 16, 17, 18 and 19). Control of the structure and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a central theme of the biology of the ADAMTS, as exemplified by the actions of the procollagen-N-propeptidases in collagen fibril assembly and of the aggrecanases in the cleavage or modification of ECM proteoglycans. Defects in certain family members give rise to inherited genetic disorders, while the aberrant expression or function of others is associated with arthritis, cancer and cardiovascular disease. In particular, ADAMTS4 and 5 have emerged as therapeutic targets in arthritis. Multiple ADAMTSs from different sub-groupings exert either positive or negative effects on tumorigenesis and metastasis, with both metalloproteinase-dependent and -independent actions known to occur. The basic ADAMTS structure comprises a metalloproteinase catalytic domain and a carboxy-terminal ancillary domain, the latter determining substrate specificity and the localization of the protease and its interaction partners; ancillary domains probably also have independent biological functions. Focusing primarily on the aggrecanases and proteoglycanases, this review provides a perspective on the evolution of the ADAMTS family, their links with developmental and disease mechanisms, and key questions for the future.",1
26018632,"Recent studies have revealed the import role played by transporters in the renal and hepatobiliary excretion of many drugs. These transporters exhibit a broad substrate specificity with a degree of overlap, suggesting the possibility of transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions with other substrates. This review is an overview of the roles of transporters and the possibility of transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions. Among the large number of transporters, we compare the Ki values of inhibitors for organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and organic anion transporters (OATs) and their therapeutic unbound concentrations. Among them, cephalosporins and probenecid have the potential to produce clinically relevant OAT-mediated drug-drug interactions, whereas cyclosporin A and rifampicin may trigger OATP-mediated ones. These drugs have been reported to cause drug-drug interactions in vivo with OATs or OATP substrates, suggesting the possibility of transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions. To avoid adverse consequences of such transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions, we need to be more aware of the role played by drug transporters as well as those caused by drug metabolizing enzymes.",1
26014922,"The First Principles for Physiology originated in and emanate from the unicellular state of life. Viewing physiology as a continuum from unicellular to multicellular organisms provides fundamental insight to ontogeny and phylogeny as a functionally integral whole. Such mechanisms are most evident under conditions of physiologic stress; all of the molecular pathways that evolved in service to the vertebrate water-land transition aided and abetted the evolution of the vertebrate lung, for example. Reduction of evolution to cell biology has an important scientific feature—it is predictive. One implication of this perspective on evolution is the likelihood that it is the unicellular state that is actually the object of selection. By looking at the process of evolution from its unicellular origins, the causal relationships between genotype and phenotype are revealed, as are many other aspects of physiology and medicine that have remained anecdotal and counter-intuitive. Evolutionary development can best be considered as a cyclical, epigenetic, reiterative environmental assessment process, originating from the unicellular state, both forward and backward, to sustain and perpetuate unicellular homeostasis.",0

25994642,"The interaction of sperm with the egg's extracellular matrix, the zona pellucida (ZP) is the first step of the union between male and female gametes. The molecular mechanisms of this process have been studied for the past six decades with the results obtained being both interesting and confusing. In this article, we describe our recent work, which attempts to address two lines of questions from previous studies. First, because there are numerous ZP binding proteins reported by various researchers, how do these proteins act together in sperm-ZP interaction? Second, why do a number of acrosomal proteins have ZP affinity? Are they involved mainly in the initial sperm-ZP binding or rather in anchoring acrosome reacting/reacted spermatozoa to the ZP? Our studies reveal that a number of ZP binding proteins and chaperones, extracted from the anterior sperm head plasma membrane, coexist as high molecular weight (HMW) complexes, and that these complexes in capacitated spermatozoa have preferential ability to bind to the ZP. Zonadhesin (ZAN), known as an acrosomal protein with ZP affinity, is one of these proteins in the HMW complexes. Immunoprecipitation indicates that ZAN interacts with other acrosomal proteins, proacrosin/acrosin and sp32 (ACRBP), also present in the HMW complexes. Immunodetection of ZAN and proacrosin/acrosin on spermatozoa further indicates that both proteins traffic to the sperm head surface during capacitation where the sperm acrosomal matrix is still intact, and therefore they are likely involved in the initial sperm-ZP binding step.",1
25987093,"IDH1/2 mutations which result in alternation in DNA methylation pattern are one of the most common methylation associated mutations in Acute myeloid leukaemia. IDH1/2 mutations frequently associated with higher platelet level, normal cytogentics and NPM1 mutations. Here we analyzed IDH1/2 mutations in 200 newly diagnosed unselected Indian adult AML patients and investigated their correlation with clinical, cytogenetic parameters along with cooperating NPM1 mutation. We detected 5.5% and 4% mutations in IDH1/2 genes, respectively. Except IDH2 c.515_516GG>AA mutation, all the other identified mutations were reported mutations. Similar to reported c.515G>A mutation, the novel c.515_516GG>AA mutation replaces 172nd arginine to lysine in the active site of the enzyme. Even though there was a preponderance of IDH1/2 mutations in NK-AML, cytogenetically abnormal patients also harboured IDH1/2 mutations. IDH1 mutations showed significant higher platelet count and NPM1 mutations. IDH2 mutated patients displayed infrequent NPM1 mutations and lower WBC count. All the NPM1 mutations in the IDH1/2 mutated cases showed type A mutation. The present data suggest that IDH1/2 mutations are associated with normal cytogenetics and type A NPM1 mutations in adult Indian AML patients.",1

Using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, we discovered 963 associated SNPs in stage 1, and replicated 105 SNPs among them in stage 2. We examined them in a combined set of stage 1 and 2 samples and observed that 65 SNPs were significantly associated with serum calcium levels. Among them, rs13068893 in the CASR gene showed the strongest significance (P=3.85 × 10(-8)). Considering the high allele frequency and significance level of the rs13068893C>G in the CASR gene, this SNP may have a key role in regulating the serum calcium level. We also successfully replicated the four loci (CASR, CSTA, DGKD and GCKR) using our data set that have been previously reported to be significantly associated with calcium levels in Europeans and Indians. Further studies with more East Asian subjects or meta-analyses on them may enable validation of our results and identification of novel genetic loci associated with serum calcium levels.",1
25964599,"Hypomethylating agents, such as azacitidine and decitabine, now constitute one of the mainstays of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) treatment. In recent years, novel recurrent mutations in multiple genes encoding RNA spliceosomal machinery (SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, SF3B1) were revealed. However, the clinical impact of these mutations on the outcomes of treatment of MDS patients with hypomethylating agents has not been described.",1
25961151,"Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of years of life lost. Genetic factors contribute to stroke prevalence, and candidate gene and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified variants associated with ischemic stroke risk. These variants often have small effects without obvious biological significance. Exome sequencing may discover predicted protein-altering variants with a potentially large effect on ischemic stroke risk.",0
25953057,"Dyslexia and language impairment (LI) are complex traits with substantial genetic components. We recently completed an association scan of the DYX2 locus, where we observed associations of markers in DCDC2, KIAA0319, ACOT13, and FAM65B with reading-, language-, and IQ-related traits. Additionally, the effects of reading-associated DYX3 markers were recently characterized using structural neuroimaging techniques. Here, we assessed the neuroimaging implications of associated DYX2 and DYX3 markers, using cortical volume, cortical thickness, and fractional anisotropy. To accomplish this, we examined eight DYX2 and three DYX3 markers in 332 subjects in the Pediatrics Imaging Neurocognition Genetics study. Imaging-genetic associations were examined by multiple linear regression, testing for influence of genotype on neuroimaging. Markers in DYX2 genes KIAA0319 and FAM65B were associated with cortical thickness in the left orbitofrontal region and global fractional anisotropy, respectively. KIAA0319 and ACOT13 were suggestively associated with overall fractional anisotropy and left pars opercularis cortical thickness, respectively. DYX3 markers showed suggestive associations with cortical thickness and volume measures in temporal regions. Notably, we did not replicate association of DYX3 markers with hippocampal measures. In summary, we performed a neuroimaging follow-up of reading-, language-, and IQ-associated DYX2 and DYX3 markers. DYX2 associations with cortical thickness may reflect variations in their role in neuronal migration. Furthermore, our findings complement gene expression and imaging studies implicating DYX3 markers in temporal regions. These studies offer insight into where and how DYX2 and DYX3 risk variants may influence neuroimaging traits. Future studies should further connect the pathways to risk variants associated with neuroimaging/neurocognitive outcomes.",1
25934352,"In 1996, a set X of 20 trinucleotides is identified in genes of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes which has in average the highest occurrence in reading frame compared to the two shifted frames (Arquès and Michel, 1996). Furthermore, this set X has an interesting mathematical property as X is a maximal C(3) self-complementary trinucleotide circular code (Arquès and Michel, 1996). In 2014, the number of trinucleotides in prokaryotic genes has been multiplied by a factor of 527. Furthermore, two new gene kingdoms of plasmids and viruses contain enough trinucleotide data to be analysed. The approach used in 1996 for identifying a preferential frame for a trinucleotide is quantified here with a new definition analysing the occurrence probability of a complementary/permutation (CP) trinucleotide set in a gene kingdom. Furthermore, in order to increase the statistical significance of results compared to those of 1996, the circular code X is studied on several gene taxonomic groups in a kingdom. Based on this new statistical approach, the circular code X is strengthened in genes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and now also identified in genes of plasmids. A subset of X with 18 or 16 trinucleotides is identified in genes of viruses. Furthermore, a simple probabilistic model based on the independent occurrence of trinucleotides in reading frame of genes explains the circular code frequencies and asymmetries observed in the shifted frames in all studied gene kingdoms. Finally, the developed approach allows to identify variant X codes in genes, i.e. trinucleotide codes which differ from X. In genes of bacteria, eukaryotes and plasmids, 14 among the 47 studied gene taxonomic groups (about 30%) have variant X codes. Seven variant X codes are identified with at least 16 trinucleotides of X. Two variant X codes XA in cyanobacteria and plasmids of cyanobacteria, and XD in birds are self-complementary, without permuted trinucleotides but non-circular. Five variant X codes XB in deinococcus, plasmids of chloroflexi and deinococcus, mammals and kinetoplasts, XC in elusimicrobia and apicomplexans, XE in fishes, XF in insects, and XG in basidiomycetes and plasmids of spirochaetes are C(3) self-complementary circular. In genes of viruses, no variant X code is found.",0
25918995,"Adult antisocial behavior (AAB) is moderately heritable, relatively common and has adverse consequences for individuals and society. We examined the molecular genetic basis of AAB in 1379 participants from a case-control study in which the cases met criteria for alcohol dependence. We also examined whether genes of interest were expressed in human brain. AAB was measured using a count of the number of Antisocial Personality Disorder criteria endorsed under criterion A from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV). Participants were genotyped on the Illumina Human 1M BeadChip. In total, all single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) accounted for 25% of the variance in AAB, although this estimate was not significant (P=0.09). Enrichment tests indicated that more significantly associated genes were over-represented in seven gene sets, and most were immune related. Our most highly associated SNP (rs4728702, P=5.77 × 10(-7)) was located in the protein-coding adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette, sub-family B (MDR/TAP), member 1 (ABCB1). In a gene-based test, ABCB1 was genome-wide significant (q=0.03). Expression analyses indicated that ABCB1 was robustly expressed in the brain. ABCB1 has been implicated in substance use, and in post hoc tests we found that variation in ABCB1 was associated with DSM-IV alcohol and cocaine dependence criterion counts. These results suggest that ABCB1 may confer risk across externalizing behaviors, and are consistent with previous suggestions that immune pathways are associated with externalizing behaviors. The results should be tempered by the fact that we did not replicate the associations for ABCB1 or the gene sets in a less-affected independent sample.",1
25915184,"Individuals who are born small for gestational age (SGA) have a risk to develop various metabolic diseases during their life course. The biological memory of the prenatal state of growth restricted individuals may be reflected in epigenetic alterations in stem cell populations. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from the Wharton's jelly of umbilical cord tissue are multipotent, and we generated primary umbilical cord MSC isolates from SGA and normal neonates, which were subsequently differentiated into adipocytes. We established chromatin state maps for histone marks H3K27 acetylation and H3K27 trimethylation and tested whether enrichment of these marks was associated with gene expression changes. After validating gene expression levels for 10 significant chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing candidate genes, we selected acyl-coenzyme A synthetase 1 (ACSL1) for further investigations due to its key roles in lipid metabolism. The ACSL1 gene was found to be highly associated with histone acetylation in adipocytes differentiated from MSCs with SGA background. In SGA-derived adipocytes, the ACSL1 expression level was also found to be associated with increased lipid loading as well as higher insulin sensitivity. ACSL1 depletion led to changes in expression of candidate genes such as proinflammatory chemokines and down-regulated both, the amount of cellular lipids and glucose uptake. Increased ACSL1, as well as modulated downstream candidate gene expression, may reflect the obese state, as detected in mice fed a high-fat diet. In summary, we believe that ACSL1 is a programmable mediator of insulin sensitivity and cellular lipid content and adipocytes differentiated from Wharton's jelly MSCs recapitulate important physiological characteristics of SGA individuals.",1
25877299,"Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have reported 19 distinct susceptibility loci for testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT). A GWA study for TGCT was performed by genotyping 610 240 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1326 cases and 6687 controls from Sweden and Norway. No novel genome-wide significant associations were observed in this discovery stage. We put forward 27 SNPs from 15 novel regions and 12 SNPs previously reported, for replication in 710 case-parent triads and 289 cases and 290 controls. Predefined biological pathways and processes, in addition to a custom-built sex-determination gene set, were subject to enrichment analyses using Meta-Analysis Gene Set Enrichment of Variant Associations (M) and Improved Gene Set Enrichment Analysis for Genome-wide Association Study (I). In the combined meta-analysis, we observed genome-wide significant association for rs7501939 on chromosome 17q12 (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.72-0.84, P = 1.1 × 10(-9)) and rs2195987 on chromosome 19p12 (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.69-0.84, P = 3.2 × 10(-8)). The marker rs7501939 on chromosome 17q12 is located in an intron of the HNF1B gene, encoding a member of the homeodomain-containing superfamily of transcription factors. The sex-determination gene set (false discovery rate, FDRM < 0.001, FDRI < 0.001) and pathways related to NF-κB, glycerophospholipid and ether lipid metabolism, as well as cancer and apoptosis, was associated with TGCT (FDR < 0.1). In addition to revealing two new TGCT susceptibility loci, our results continue to support the notion that genes governing normal germ cell development in utero are implicated in the development of TGCT.",1
25871911,"We analyzed the genomic and phosphoproteomic profiles of breast cancer tissue obtained from six patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who had highly durable (≥ 5 years) and, in some cases, ongoing clinical responses with capecitabine. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from patients' primary (n = 4) or metastatic (n = 2) breast cancers were utilized for targeted next-generation sequencing and reversed phase protein microarray. Two patients received capecitabine monotherapy. Four patients received capecitabine in combination with paclitaxel; three of these continued single-agent capecitabine after stopping paclitaxel. Capecitabine was discontinued for progressive disease after a mean of 66 months in four patients (range 54-86 months), and two patients remain on therapy, having received capecitabine for >91 months and >122 months, respectively. Three patients' cancers (50%) had likely functional alterations in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling genes, while three other patients' cancers had variants of unknown significance in these pathways. Mutations in PIK3CA, amplifications of FGFR1 or ZNF703, or phosphorylation of HER family receptors and their downstream proteins did not preclude exceptional responses to capecitabine. None of the patients' tumors harbored TP53 or PTEN mutations. Four of the patients had breast cancer tissue available for PTEN immunohistochemistry, and all four patients' cancers were positive for PTEN. These surprising findings in a group of phenotypically similar patients with ER-positive, endocrine therapy-pretreated, HER2-negative metastases, are supported by preclinical data showing that sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil is enhanced by deficiencies in chromatin remodeling and homologous recombination genes. Our findings suggest that mutations that inactivate homologous recombination and/or chromatin remodeling genes within ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers may predict for highly durable responses to capecitabine.",1
25869804,"To identify common variants contributing to normal variation in two specific domains of cognitive functioning, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of executive functioning and information processing speed in non-demented older adults from the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) consortium. Neuropsychological testing was available for 5429-32,070 subjects of European ancestry aged 45 years or older, free of dementia and clinical stroke at the time of cognitive testing from 20 cohorts in the discovery phase. We analyzed performance on the Trail Making Test parts A and B, the Letter Digit Substitution Test (LDST), the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST), semantic and phonemic fluency tests, and the Stroop Color and Word Test. Replication was sought in 1311-21860 subjects from 20 independent cohorts. A significant association was observed in the discovery cohorts for the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17518584 (discovery P-value=3.12 × 10(-8)) and in the joint discovery and replication meta-analysis (P-value=3.28 × 10(-9) after adjustment for age, gender and education) in an intron of the gene cell adhesion molecule 2 (CADM2) for performance on the LDST/DSST. Rs17518584 is located about 170 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the major transcript for the CADM2 gene, but is within an intron of a variant transcript that includes an alternative first exon. The variant is associated with expression of CADM2 in the cingulate cortex (P-value=4 × 10(-4)). The protein encoded by CADM2 is involved in glutamate signaling (P-value=7.22 × 10(-15)), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transport (P-value=1.36 × 10(-11)) and neuron cell-cell adhesion (P-value=1.48 × 10(-13)). Our findings suggest that genetic variation in the CADM2 gene is associated with individual differences in information processing speed.",1
25863161,"Collagen fibers are the main components of most of the extracellular matrices where they provide a structural support to cells, tissues and organs. Fibril-forming procollagens are synthetized as individual chains that associate to form homo- or hetero-trimers. They are characterized by the presence of a central triple helical domain flanked by amino and carboxy propeptides. Although there are some exceptions, these two propeptides have to be proteolytically removed to allow the almost spontaneous assembly of the trimers into collagen fibrils and fibers. While the carboxy-propeptide is mainly cleaved by proteinases from the tolloid family, the amino-propeptide is usually processed by procollagen N-proteinases: ADAMTS2, 3 and 14. This review summarizes the current knowledge concerning this subfamily of ADAMTS enzymes and discusses their potential involvement in physiopathological processes that are not directly linked to fibrillar procollagen processing.",1
25846892,"This review begins with a definition of biological evolution and a description of its general principles. This is followed by a presentation of the biological basis of culture, specifically the concept of social selection. Further, conditions for cultural evolution are proposed, including a suggestion for language being the cultural replicator corresponding to the concept of the gene in biological evolution. Principles of cultural evolution are put forward and compared to the principles of biological evolution. Special emphasis is laid on the principle of selection in cultural evolution, including presentation of the concept of cultural fitness. The importance of language as a necessary condition for cultural evolution is stressed. Subsequently, prime differences between biological and cultural evolution are presented, followed by a discussion on interaction of our genome and our culture. The review aims at contributing to the present discussion concerning the modern development of the general theory of evolution, for example by giving a tentative formulation of the necessary and sufficient conditions for cultural evolution, and proposing that human creativity and mind reading or theory of mind are motors specific for it. The paper ends with the notion of the still ongoing coevolution of genes and culture.",0
25814290,"Behavior which is effective only through the mediation of other persons has so many distinguishing dynamic and topographical properties that a special treatment is justified and indeed demanded (Skinner, 1957, p. 2). Skinner's demand for a special treatment of verbal behavior can be extended within that field to domains such as music, poetry, drama, and the topic of this paper: mathematics. For centuries, mathematics has been of special concern to philosophers who have continually argued to the present day about what some deem its ""special nature."" Two interrelated principal questions have been: (1) Are the subjects of mathematical interest pre-existing in some transcendental realm and thus are ""discovered"" as one might discover a new planet; and (2) Why is mathematics so effective in the practices of science and engineering even though originally such mathematics was ""pure"" with applications neither contemplated or even desired? I argue that considering the actual practice of mathematics in its history and in the context of acquired verbal behavior one can address at least some of its apparent mysteries. To this end, I discuss some of the structural and functional features of mathematics including verbal operants, rule-and contingency-modulated behavior, relational frames, the shaping of abstraction, and the development of intuition. How is it possible to understand Nature by properly talking about it? Essentially, it is because nature taught us how to talk.",0
25813358,"The estimation of species trees using multiple loci has become increasingly common. Because different loci can have different phylogenetic histories (reflected in different gene tree topologies) for multiple biological causes, new approaches to species tree estimation have been developed that take gene tree heterogeneity into account. Among these multiple causes, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), modeled by the multi-species coalescent, is potentially the most common cause of gene tree heterogeneity, and much of the focus of the recent literature has been on how to estimate species trees in the presence of ILS. Despite progress in developing statistically consistent techniques for estimating species trees when gene trees can differ due to ILS, there is substantial controversy in the systematics community as to whether to use the new coalescent-based methods or the traditional concatenation methods. One of the key issues that has been raised is understanding the impact of gene tree estimation error on coalescent-based methods that operate by combining gene trees. Here we explore the mathematical guarantees of coalescent-based methods when analyzing estimated rather than true gene trees. Our results provide some insight into the differences between promise of coalescent-based methods in theory and their performance in practice.",0
25798622,"Decreased insulin sensitivity, also referred to as insulin resistance (IR), is a fundamental abnormality in patients with type 2 diabetes and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. While IR predisposition is heritable, the genetic basis remains largely unknown. The GENEticS of Insulin Sensitivity consortium conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for direct measures of insulin sensitivity, such as euglycemic clamp or insulin suppression test, in 2,764 European individuals, with replication in an additional 2,860 individuals. The presence of a nonsynonymous variant of N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) [rs1208 (803A>G, K268R)] was strongly associated with decreased insulin sensitivity that was independent of BMI. The rs1208 ""A"" allele was nominally associated with IR-related traits, including increased fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C, total and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and coronary artery disease. NAT2 acetylates arylamine and hydrazine drugs and carcinogens, but predicted acetylator NAT2 phenotypes were not associated with insulin sensitivity. In a murine adipocyte cell line, silencing of NAT2 ortholog Nat1 decreased insulin-mediated glucose uptake, increased basal and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis, and decreased adipocyte differentiation, while Nat1 overexpression produced opposite effects. Nat1-deficient mice had elevations in fasting blood glucose, insulin, and triglycerides and decreased insulin sensitivity, as measured by glucose and insulin tolerance tests, with intermediate effects in Nat1 heterozygote mice. Our results support a role for NAT2 in insulin sensitivity.",1
25796927,"The objective of the present study was to develop the criteria for forensic-medical diagnostics of an electrical injury inflicted in the aqueous environment based on the characteristics of the electrical mark. The specific morphological features of the electrical injuries inflicted in the aqueous environment that were discovered in the materials available for the forensic medical expertise were analysed taking into consideration the results of the relevant research reported in the forensic medical literature. It was shown that an electrical injury inflicted in the aqueous environment results in the formation of an unusual mark in the form of blisters containing no watery liquid associated with electrogenic oedema in the surrounding tissues. Macroscopic and microscopic studies of the electrical mark failed to reveal the signs of grade III and IV grade thermal burning or thermally affected hair. It is concluded that the consistent characteristics of the electrical mark resulting from the injury inflicted by technical electricity in the aqueous environment include cell lengthening, blister formation inside the corneal layer, and the separation of epidermis from the skin proper.",0
25792409,"Microstructure, mechanical properties and corrosion behaviour of WZ21 (%wt) alloy prepared by a powder metallurgy route from rapidly solidified powders have been studied. Results were compared to those of the same alloy prepared through a conventional route of casting and extrusion. The microstructure of the extruded ingot consisted of α-Mg grains and Mg3Zn3Y2 (W-phase) and LPSO-phase particles located at grain boundaries. Moreover, stacking faults were also observed within α-Mg grains. The alloy processed by the powder metallurgy route exhibited a more homogeneous and finer microstructure, with a grain size of 2 μm. In this case W-phase and Mg24Y5 phase were identified, but not the LPSO-phase. The microstructural refinement induced by the use of rapidly solidified powders strengthened the alloy at room temperature and promoted superplasticity at higher strain rates. Corrosion behaviour in PBS medium evidenced certain physical barrier effect of the almost continuous arrangements of second phases aligned along the extrusion direction in conventionally processed WZ21 alloy, with a stable tendency around 7 mm/year. On the other hand, powder metallurgy processing promoted significant pitting corrosion, inducing accelerated corrosion rate during prolonged immersion times.",0
25778476,"APOE ɛ4, the most significant genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD), may mask effects of other loci. We re-analyzed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) Consortium in APOE ɛ4+ (10 352 cases and 9207 controls) and APOE ɛ4- (7184 cases and 26 968 controls) subgroups as well as in the total sample testing for interaction between a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and APOE ɛ4 status. Suggestive associations (P<1 × 10(-4)) in stage 1 were evaluated in an independent sample (stage 2) containing 4203 subjects (APOE ɛ4+: 1250 cases and 536 controls; APOE ɛ4-: 718 cases and 1699 controls). Among APOE ɛ4- subjects, novel genome-wide significant (GWS) association was observed with 17 SNPs (all between KANSL1 and LRRC37A on chromosome 17 near MAPT) in a meta-analysis of the stage 1 and stage 2 data sets (best SNP, rs2732703, P=5·8 × 10(-9)). Conditional analysis revealed that rs2732703 accounted for association signals in the entire 100-kilobase region that includes MAPT. Except for previously identified AD loci showing stronger association in APOE ɛ4+ subjects (CR1 and CLU) or APOE ɛ4- subjects (MS4A6A/MS4A4A/MS4A6E), no other SNPs were significantly associated with AD in a specific APOE genotype subgroup. In addition, the finding in the stage 1 sample that AD risk is significantly influenced by the interaction of APOE with rs1595014 in TMEM106B (P=1·6 × 10(-7)) is noteworthy, because TMEM106B variants have previously been associated with risk of frontotemporal dementia. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis revealed that rs113986870, one of the GWS SNPs near rs2732703, is significantly associated with four KANSL1 probes that target transcription of the first translated exon and an untranslated exon in hippocampus (P ⩽ 1.3 × 10(-8)), frontal cortex (P ⩽ 1.3 × 10(-9)) and temporal cortex (P⩽1.2 × 10(-11)). Rs113986870 is also strongly associated with a MAPT probe that targets transcription of alternatively spliced exon 3 in frontal cortex (P=9.2 × 10(-6)) and temporal cortex (P=2.6 × 10(-6)). Our APOE-stratified GWAS is the first to show GWS association for AD with SNPs in the chromosome 17q21.31 region. Replication of this finding in independent samples is needed to verify that SNPs in this region have significantly stronger effects on AD risk in persons lacking APOE ɛ4 compared with persons carrying this allele, and if this is found to hold, further examination of this region and studies aimed at deciphering the mechanism(s) are warranted.",1
25774636,"Human genetic factors predispose to tuberculosis (TB). We studied 7.6 million genetic variants in 5,530 people with pulmonary TB and in 5,607 healthy controls. In the combined analysis of these subjects and the follow-up cohort (15,087 TB patients and controls altogether), we found an association between TB and variants located in introns of the ASAP1 gene on chromosome 8q24 (P = 2.6 × 10(-11) for rs4733781; P = 1.0 × 10(-10) for rs10956514). Dendritic cells (DCs) showed high ASAP1 expression that was reduced after Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and rs10956514 was associated with the level of reduction of ASAP1 expression. The ASAP1 protein is involved in actin and membrane remodeling and has been associated with podosomes. The ASAP1-depleted DCs showed impaired matrix degradation and migration. Therefore, genetically determined excessive reduction of ASAP1 expression in M. tuberculosis-infected DCs may lead to their impaired migration, suggesting a potential mechanism of predisposition to TB.",1
25763902,"The bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC) represents the severe end of the uro-rectal malformation spectrum, and is thought to result from aberrant embryonic morphogenesis of the cloacal membrane and the urorectal septum. The most common form of BEEC is isolated classic bladder exstrophy (CBE). To identify susceptibility loci for CBE, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 110 CBE patients and 1,177 controls of European origin. Here, an association was found with a region of approximately 220kb on chromosome 5q11.1. This region harbors the ISL1 (ISL LIM homeobox 1) gene. Multiple markers in this region showed evidence for association with CBE, including 84 markers with genome-wide significance. We then performed a meta-analysis using data from a previous GWAS by our group of 98 CBE patients and 526 controls of European origin. This meta-analysis also implicated the 5q11.1 locus in CBE risk. A total of 138 markers at this locus reached genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis, and the most significant marker (rs9291768) achieved a P value of 2.13 × 10-12. No other locus in the meta-analysis achieved genome-wide significance. We then performed murine expression analyses to follow up this finding. Here, Isl1 expression was detected in the genital region within the critical time frame for human CBE development. Genital regions with Isl1 expression included the peri-cloacal mesenchyme and the urorectal septum. The present study identified the first genome-wide significant locus for CBE at chromosomal region 5q11.1, and provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that ISL1 is the responsible candidate gene in this region.",1

25758996,"Wine is the most popular alcoholic beverage around the world and because of its importance in society has been widely studied. Understanding what drives its flavor has been a quest for decades but much is still unknown and will be determined at least in part by individual taste preferences. Recently studies in the genetics of taste have uncovered the role of different genes in the determination of food preferences giving new insight on its physiology. In this context we have performed a genome-wide association study on red and white wine liking using three isolated populations collected in Italy, and replicated our results on two additional populations coming from the Netherland and Central Asia for a total of 3885 samples. We have found a significant association (P=2.1 × 10(-8)) between white wine liking and rs9276975:C>T a polymorphism in the HLA-DOA gene encoding a non-canonical MHC II molecule, which regulates other MHC II molecules. The same association was also found with red wine liking (P=8.3 × 10(-6)). Sex-separated analysis have also revealed that the effect of HLA-DOA is twice as large in women as compared to men suggesting an interaction between this polymorphism and gender. Our results are one of the first examples of genome-wide association between liking of a commonly consumed food and gene variants. Moreover, our results suggest a role of the MHC system in the determination of food preferences opening new insight in this field in general.",1
25746821,"Effective instructional planning and intervening rely heavily on accurate understanding of students' growth, but relatively few researchers have examined mathematics achievement trajectories, particularly for students with special needs. We applied linear, quadratic, and piecewise linear mixed-effects models to identify the best-fitting model for mathematics development over elementary and middle school and to ascertain differences in growth trajectories of children with learning disabilities relative to their typically developing peers. The analytic sample of 2150 students was drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study - Kindergarten Cohort, a nationally representative sample of United States children who entered kindergarten in 1998. We first modeled students' mathematics growth via multiple mixed-effects models to determine the best fitting model of 9-year growth and then compared the trajectories of students with and without learning disabilities. Results indicate that the piecewise linear mixed-effects model captured best the functional form of students' mathematics trajectories. In addition, there were substantial achievement gaps between students with learning disabilities and students with no disabilities, and their trajectories differed such that students without disabilities progressed at a higher rate than their peers who had learning disabilities. The results underscore the need for further research to understand how to appropriately model students' mathematics trajectories and the need for attention to mathematics achievement gaps in policy.",0
25743105,"Acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas is a rare tumor with a poor prognosis. Compared to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, its molecular features are poorly known. We studied a total of 11 acinar cell carcinomas, including 3 by exome and 4 by target sequencing. Exome sequencing revealed 65 nonsynonymous mutations and 22 indels with a mutation rate of 3.4 mutations/Mb per tumor, on average. By accounting for not only somatic but also germline mutations with loss of the wild-type allele, we identified recurrent mutations of BRCA2 and FAT genes. BRCA2 showed somatic or germline premature termination mutations, with loss of the wild-type allele in 3 of 7 tumors. FAT1, FAT3, and FAT4 showed somatic or germline missense mutations in 4 of 7 tumors. The germline FAT mutations were with loss of the wild-type allele. Loss of BRCA2 expression was observed in 5 of 11 tumors. One patient with a BRCA2-mutated tumor experienced complete remission of liver metastasis following cisplatinum chemotherapy. In conclusion, acinar cell carcinomas show a distinct mutation pattern and often harbor somatic or germline mutations of BRCA2 and FAT genes. This result may warrant assessment of BRCA2 abrogation in patients with the carcinoma to determine their sensitivity to chemotherapy.",1
25730767,"Transcriptional elongation is critical for gene expression regulation during embryogenesis. The super elongation complex (SEC) governs this process by mobilizing paused RNA polymerase II (RNAP2). Using exome sequencing, we discovered missense mutations in AFF4, a core component of the SEC, in three unrelated probands with a new syndrome that phenotypically overlaps Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) that we have named CHOPS syndrome (C for cognitive impairment and coarse facies, H for heart defects, O for obesity, P for pulmonary involvement and S for short stature and skeletal dysplasia). Transcriptome and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses demonstrated similar alterations of genome-wide binding of AFF4, cohesin and RNAP2 in CdLS and CHOPS syndrome. Direct molecular interaction of the SEC, cohesin and RNAP2 was demonstrated. These data support a common molecular pathogenesis for CHOPS syndrome and CdLS caused by disturbance of transcriptional elongation due to alterations in genome-wide binding of AFF4 and cohesin.",1
25722414,"Reactivation of telomerase, the chromosome end-replicating enzyme, drives human cell immortality and cancer. Point mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene promoter occur at high frequency in multiple cancers, including urothelial cancer (UC), but their effect on telomerase function has been unclear. In a study of 23 human UC cell lines, we show that these promoter mutations correlate with higher levels of TERT messenger RNA (mRNA), TERT protein, telomerase enzymatic activity, and telomere length. Although previous studies found no relation between TERT promoter mutations and UC patient outcome, we find that elevated TERT mRNA expression strongly correlates with reduced disease-specific survival in two independent UC patient cohorts (n = 35; n = 87). These results suggest that high telomerase activity may be a better marker of aggressive UC tumors than TERT promoter mutations alone.",1
25721401,"Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9 (ACAD9) is an assembly factor for mitochondrial respiratory chain Complex I (CI), and ACAD9 mutations are recognized as a frequent cause of CI deficiency. ACAD9 also retains enzyme ACAD activity for long-chain fatty acids in vitro, but the biological relevance of this function remains controversial partly because of the tissue specificity of ACAD9 expression: high in liver and neurons and minimal in skin fibroblasts. In this study, we hypothesized that this enzymatic ACAD activity is required for full fatty acid oxidation capacity in cells expressing high levels of ACAD9 and that loss of this function is important in determining phenotype in ACAD9-deficient patients. First, we confirmed that HEK293 cells express ACAD9 abundantly. Then, we showed that ACAD9 knockout in HEK293 cells affected long-chain fatty acid oxidation along with Cl, both of which were rescued by wild type ACAD9. Further, we evaluated whether the loss of ACAD9 enzymatic fatty acid oxidation affects clinical severity in patients with ACAD9 mutations. The effects on ACAD activity of 16 ACAD9 mutations identified in 24 patients were evaluated using a prokaryotic expression system. We showed that there was a significant inverse correlation between residual enzyme ACAD activity and phenotypic severity of ACAD9-deficient patients. These results provide evidence that in cells where it is strongly expressed, ACAD9 plays a physiological role in fatty acid oxidation, which contributes to the severity of the phenotype in ACAD9-deficient patients. Accordingly, treatment of ACAD9 patients should aim at counteracting both CI and fatty acid oxidation dysfunctions.",1
25712922,"X-linked acrogigantism (X-LAG) is a new syndrome of pituitary gigantism, caused by microduplications on chromosome Xq26.3, encompassing the gene GPR101, which is highly upregulated in pituitary tumors. We conducted this study to explore the clinical, radiological, and hormonal phenotype and responses to therapy in patients with X-LAG syndrome. The study included 18 patients (13 sporadic) with X-LAG and microduplication of chromosome Xq26.3. All sporadic cases had unique duplications and the inheritance pattern in two families was dominant, with all Xq26.3 duplication carriers being affected. Patients began to grow rapidly as early as 2-3 months of age (median 12 months). At diagnosis (median delay 27 months), patients had a median height and weight standard deviation scores (SDS) of >+3.9 SDS. Apart from the increased overall body size, the children had acromegalic symptoms including acral enlargement and facial coarsening. More than a third of cases had increased appetite. Patients had marked hypersecretion of GH/IGF1 and usually prolactin, due to a pituitary macroadenoma or hyperplasia. Primary neurosurgical control was achieved with extensive anterior pituitary resection, but postoperative hypopituitarism was frequent. Control with somatostatin analogs was not readily achieved despite moderate to high levels of expression of somatostatin receptor subtype-2 in tumor tissue. Postoperative use of adjuvant pegvisomant resulted in control of IGF1 in all five cases where it was employed. X-LAG is a new infant-onset gigantism syndrome that has a severe clinical phenotype leading to challenging disease management.",1

25685905,"Geochemical measurements on well-dated sediment cores from Lake Er (Erhai) are used to determine the timing of changes in metal concentrations over 4500 years in Yunnan, a borderland region in southwestern China noted for rich mineral deposits but with inadequately documented metallurgical history. Our findings add new insight into the impacts and environmental legacy of human exploitation of metal resources in Yunnan history. We observe an increase in copper at 1500 BC resulting from atmospheric emissions associated with metallurgy. These data clarify the chronological issues related to links between the onset of Yunnan metallurgy and the advent of bronze technology in adjacent Southeast Asia, subjects that have been debated for nearly half a century. We also observe an increase from 1100 to 1300 AD in a number of heavy metals including lead, silver, zinc, and cadmium from atmospheric emissions associated with silver smelting. Culminating during the rule of the Mongols, known as the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368 AD), these metal concentrations approach levels three to four times higher than those from industrialized mining activity occurring within the catchment today. Notably, the concentrations of lead approach levels at which harmful effects may be observed in aquatic organisms. The persistence of this lead pollution over time created an environmental legacy that likely contributes to known issues in modern day sediment quality. We demonstrate that historic metallurgical production in Yunnan can cause substantial impacts on the sediment quality of lake systems, similar to other paleolimnological findings around the globe.",0
25681483,"Functional status assessment has been recommended as a part of a complete nutrition assessment for decades, but the specific components of this assessment have eluded a consensus definition. The recent Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics/American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition consensus criteria for identification of malnutrition include functional assessment determined by handgrip dynamometry, with the understanding that this technique is not practical for use in some patient populations. Other techniques for functional assessment include physical performance measures such as timed gait and chair stands, as well as activities of daily living tools such as the Katz Index, Lawton Scale, and Karnofsky Scale Index. Manual muscle testing and computed tomography scan assessment of lean tissue are other tools that show promise in correlating functional and nutrition assessments. Functional assessment parameters may be least well correlated with nutrition status in older individuals. Despite a number of scientific studies of a variety of tools for functional assessment, there is to date no definitive tool for use in all individuals in all settings. Nutrition scientists and clinicians must continue to collaborate with colleagues in physical and occupational therapy, geriatrics, and nursing to refine current functional assessment tools to more effectively correlate with nutrition and malnutrition assessment parameters.",0
25656805,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are two of the most common and severe mental disorders, the etiologies of which are not yet clearly elucidated. The ACSM1 gene has been identified as a susceptibility gene for SCZ in two previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). ACSM1 catalyzes the activation of fatty acids and plays an important role in the metabolic system. Some evidence has suggested that ACSM1 contributes to a genetic risk for MDD. The present study aimed to evaluate the common genetic risk of the ACSM1 gene in these two disorders in the Han Chinese population. In total, 1235 patients with SCZ, 1045 patients with MDD and 1235 control subjects of Chinese origin were recruited. Six single nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) in ACSM1 were genotyped to test their associations with SCZ and MDD. SNP rs163234 was found to be significantly associated with both SCZ (permutated Pallele=1.700×10(-3), OR=1.350 [95% CI=1.152-1.581]) and MDD (permutated Pallele=4.800×10(-3), OR=1.329 [95% CI=1.127-1.567]). SNP rs433598 showed a strong association with SCZ (permutated Pallele=4.300×10(-3), OR=1.303 [95% CI=1.117-1.520]). Haplotype analysis of the blocks containing the two positive markers also revealed a significant association. This is the first study to assess the possible association of the ACSM1 gene with a genetic susceptibility for MDD. Our data are the first to suggest a positive association of the ACSM1 gene with a genetic susceptibility for SCZ and MDD in the Han Chinese population.",1
25655044,"In genetics, the promoter is one of the most important regulatory elements controlling the spatiotemporal expression of a target gene. However, most studies have focused on core or proximal promoter regions, and information on regions that are more distant from the 5'-flanking region of the proximal promoter is often lacking. Here, approximately 4-kb of the sericin1 (Ser1) promoter was predicted to contain many potential transcriptional factor binding sites (TFBSs). Transgenic experiments have revealed that more TFBSs included in the promoter improved gene transcription. However, multi-copy proximal Ser1 promoter combinations did not improve gene expression at the transcriptional level. Instead, increasing the promoter copy number repressed transcription. Furthermore, a correlation analysis between two contiguous genes, firefly luciferase (FLuc) and EGFP, was conducted at the transcriptional level; a significant correlation was obtained regardless of the insertion site. The ELISA results also revealed a significant correlation between the transcriptional and translational EGFP levels. Therefore, the exogenous gene expression level can be predicted by simply detecting an adjacent EGFP. In conclusion, our results provide important insights for further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying promoter function. Additionally, a new approach was developed to quickly screen transgenic strains that highly express exogenous genes.",1
25650807,"Genomic translocation events frequently underlie cancer development through generation of gene fusions with oncogenic properties. Identification of such fusion transcripts by transcriptome sequencing might help to discover new potential therapeutic targets. We developed TRUP (Tumor-specimen suited RNA-seq Unified Pipeline) (https://github.com/ruping/TRUP), a computational approach that combines split-read and read-pair analysis with de novo assembly for the identification of chimeric transcripts in cancer specimens. We apply TRUP to RNA-seq data of different tumor types, and find it to be more sensitive than alternative tools in detecting chimeric transcripts, such as secondary rearrangements in EML4-ALK-positive lung tumors, or recurrent inactivating rearrangements affecting RASSF8.",1
25649181,"It has been difficult to identify genes affecting drug response to Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). We used multiple cross-sectional assessments of depressive symptoms in a population-based study to identify potential genetic interactions with SSRIs as a model to study genetic variants associated with SSRI response. This study, embedded in the prospective Rotterdam Study, included all successfully genotyped participants with data on depressive symptoms (CES-D scores). We used repeated measurement models to test multiplicative interaction between genetic variants and use of SSRIs on repeated CESD scores. Besides a genome-wide analysis, we also performed an analysis which was restricted to genes related to the serotonergic signaling pathway. A total of 273 out of 14,937 assessments of depressive symptoms in 6443 participants, use of an SSRI was recorded. After correction for multiple testing, no plausible loci were identified in the genome-wide analysis. However, among the top 10 independent loci with the lowest p-values, findings within two genes (FSHR and HMGB4) might be of interest. Among 26 genes related to the serotonergic signaling pathway, the rs6108160 polymorphism in the PLCB1 gene reached statistical significance after Bonferroni correction (p-value = 8.1e-5). Also, the widely replicated 102C > T polymorphism in the HTR2A gene showed a statistically significant drug-gene interaction with SSRI use. Therefore, the present study suggests that drug-gene interaction models on (repeated) cross-sectional assessments of depressive symptoms in a population-based study can identify potential loci that may influence SSRI response.",1
25645620,"Caloric restriction and intermittent fasting are known to improve glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance in several species including humans. The aim of this study was to unravel potential mechanisms by which these interventions improve insulin sensitivity and protect from type 2 diabetes. Diabetes-susceptible New Zealand Obese mice were either 10% calorie restricted (CR) or fasted every other day (IF), and compared to ad libitum (AL) fed control mice. AL mice showed a diabetes prevalence of 43%, whereas mice under CR and IF were completely protected against hyperglycemia. Proteomic analysis of hepatic lipid droplets revealed significantly higher levels of PSMD9 (co-activator Bridge-1), MIF (macrophage migration inhibitor factor), TCEB2 (transcription elongation factor B (SIII), polypeptide 2), ACY1 (aminoacylase 1) and FABP5 (fatty acid binding protein 5), and a marked reduction of GSTA3 (glutathione S-transferase alpha 3) in samples of CR and IF mice. In addition, accumulation of diacylglycerols (DAGs) was significantly reduced in livers of IF mice (P=0.045) while CR mice showed a similar tendency (P=0.062). In particular, 9 DAG species were significantly reduced in response to IF, of which DAG-40:4 and DAG-40:7 also showed significant effects after CR. This was associated with a decreased PKCε activation and might explain the improved insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, our data indicate that protection against diabetes upon caloric restriction and intermittent fasting associates with a modulation of lipid droplet protein composition and reduction of intracellular DAG species.",1
25641918,"In this manuscript, a study of the effect of microwave radiation on the high-performance liquid chromatography separation of tocopherols and vitamin K1 was conducted. The novelty of the application was the use of a relatively low polarity mobile phase in which the dielectric heating effect was minimized to evaluate the nonthermal effect of the microwave radiation over the separation process. Results obtained show that microwave-assisted high-performance liquid chromatography had a shorter analysis time from 31.5 to 13.3 min when the lowest microwave power was used. Moreover, narrower peaks were obtained; hence the separation was more efficient maintaining or even increasing the resolution between the peaks. This result confirms that the increase in mobile phase temperature is not the only variable for improving the separation process but also other nonthermal processes must intervene. Fluorescence detection demonstrated better signal-to-noise compared to photodiode arrayed detection mainly due to the independent effect of microwave pulses on the baseline noise, but photodiode array detection was finally chosen as it allowed a simultaneous detection of nonfluorescent compounds. Finally, a determination of the content of the vitamin E homologs was carried out in different vegetable oils. Results were coherent with those found in the literature.",0
25636623,"Genes with indispensable functions are identified as essential; however, the traditional gene-level perspective of essentiality has several limitations. We hypothesized that protein domains, the independent structural or functional units of a polypeptide chain, are responsible for gene essentiality. If the essentiality of domains is known, the essential genes could be identified. To find such essential domains, we have developed an EM algorithm-based Essential Domain Prediction (EDP) Model. With simulated datasets, the model provided convergent results given different initial values and offered accurate predictions even with noise. We then applied the EDP model to six microbes and predicted 3,450 domains to be essential in at least one species, ranging 8-24 % in each species.",0
25636617,"Essential genes are indispensable for the target organism's survival. Large-scale identification and characterization of essential genes has shown to be beneficial in both fundamental biology and medicine fields. Current existing genome-scale experimental screenings of essential genes are time consuming and costly, also sometimes confer erroneous essential gene annotations. To circumvent these difficulties, many research groups turn to computational approaches as the alternative to identify essential genes. Here, we developed an integrative machine-learning based statistical framework to accurately predict essential genes in microorganisms. First we extracted a variety of relevant features derived from different aspects of an organism's genomic sequences. Then we selected a subset of features have high predictive power of gene essentiality through a carefully designed feature selection system. Using the selected features as input, we constructed an ensemble classifier and trained the model on a well-studied microorganism. After fine-tuning the model parameters in cross-validation, we tested the model on the other microorganism. We found that the tenfold cross-validation results within the same organism achieves a high predictive accuracy (AUC ~0.9), and cross-organism predictions between distant related organisms yield the AUC scores from 0.69 to 0.89, which significantly outperformed homology mapping.",0
25620615,"More than 25% of the patients with breast cancer (BC) develop metastatic disease. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between DNA methylation levels in genes regulating cell growth, invasiveness, and metastasis and advanced BCs and evaluated the clinical utility of methylation profiles for detecting metastatic potential. Pyrosequencing was used to quantify methylation levels in 11 cancer-associated genes in primary tumors (PTs), lymph node metastases (LNMs), plasma (PL), and blood cells from 206 patients with invasive BC. Protein expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. PTs showed hypermethylation of A isoform of the RAS-association domain family 1 (RASSF1A), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 12 (CXCL12), and disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 23 (ADAM23) (means 38.98%, 24.84%, 12.04%, and 10.01%, respectively). Positive correlations were identified between methylations in PTs and LNMs, but not between PL and PTs. The cumulative methylation of PTs and LNMs manifested similar spectrums of methylated genes that indicate the maintaining of aberrant methylation during breast tumorigenesis. Significantly increased methylation levels in RASSF1A, APC, CXCL12, and ADAM23 were found in estrogen receptor (ER) positive BCs in comparison with ER negative cases. Regarding these results, the evaluation of DNA methylation could be more informative in testing of patients with ER positive BC. The risk for LNMs development and higher proliferation of cancer cells measured through Ki-67 expression was increased by hypermethylation of CXCL12 and ADAM23, respectively. Therefore, the quantification of CXCL12 and ADAM23 methylation could be useful for the prediction of advanced stage of BC.",1
25608650,"Working memory deficit is the core neurocognitive disorder in schizophrenia patients. To identify the factors underlying working memory deficit in schizophrenia patients and to explore the implication of possible genes in the working memory using genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia, computerized delay-matching-to-sample (DMS) and whole genome genotyping data were obtained from 100 first-episode, treatment-naïve patients with schizophrenia and 140 healthy controls from the Mental Health Centre of the West China Hospital, Sichuan University. A composite score, delay-matching-to-sample total correct numbers (DMS-TC), was found to be significantly different between the patients and control. On associating quantitative DMS-TC with interactive variables of groups × genotype, one SNP (rs1411832), located downstream of YWHAZP5 in chromosome 10, was found to be associated with the working memory deficit in schizophrenia patients with lowest p-value (p = 2.02 × 10(-7)). ConsensusPathDB identified that genes with SNPs for which p values below the threshold of 5 × 10(-5) were significantly enriched in GO:0007155 (cell adhesion, p < 0.001). This study indicates that working memory, as an endophenotype of schizophrenia, could improve the efficacy of GWAS in schizophrenia. However, further study is required to replicate the results from our study.",1
25600511,"The burgeoning immigrant population in major immigrant-receiving countries in North America and Europe has necessitated researchers and policymakers in these countries to examine the academic success of children of immigration and the factors contributing to their academic success. However, there is sparse research on the academic trajectories of children of immigration in other continents, such as Asia. Hence, the purpose of the present study was to examine first- and second-generation immigrant adolescents' mathematics achievement and dispositions towards mathematics in comparison to their native peers in one of the Middle Eastern countries in Asia, Qatar. The results of the study indicated that both first- and second-generation immigrant adolescents tended to have higher mathematics achievement, intrinsic motivation to learn mathematics, instrumental motivation to learn mathematics, mathematics self-efficacy, and mathematics self-concept than did their native counterparts. Moreover, immigrant adolescents tended to have lower mathematics anxiety than did their native peers. The study also revealed significant differences between first- and second-generation immigrant adolescents with respect to their mathematics achievement and dispositions towards mathematics.",0
25595115,"Behavior which is effective only through the mediation of other persons has so many distinguishing dynamic and topographical properties that a special treatment is justified and indeed demanded (Skinner, 1957, p. 2). Skinner's demand for a special treatment of verbal behavior can be extended within that field to domains such as music, poetry, drama, and the topic of this paper: mathematics. For centuries, mathematics has been of special concern to philosophers who have continually argued to the present day about what some deem its ""special nature."" Two interrelated principal questions have been: (1) Are the subjects of mathematical interest pre-existing in some transcendental realm and thus are ""discovered"" as one might discover a new planet; and (2) Why is mathematics so effective in the practices of science and engineering even though originally such mathematics was ""pure"" with applications neither contemplated or even desired? I argue that considering the actual practice of mathematics in its history and in the context of acquired verbal behavior one can address at least some of its apparent mysteries. To this end, I discuss some of the structural and functional features of mathematics including verbal operants, rule-and contingency-modulated behavior, relational frames, the shaping of abstraction, and the development of intuition. How is it possible to understand Nature by properly talking about it? Essentially, it is because nature taught us how to talk.",0
25593140,"Nutritional epidemiology has recently been criticized on several fronts, including the inability to measure diet accurately, and for its reliance on observational studies to address etiologic questions. In addition, several recent meta-analyses with serious methodologic flaws have arrived at erroneous or misleading conclusions, reigniting controversy over formerly settled debates. All of this has raised questions regarding the ability of nutritional epidemiologic studies to inform policy. These criticisms, to a large degree, stem from a misunderstanding of the methodologic issues of the field and the inappropriate use of the drug trial paradigm in nutrition research. The exposure of interest in nutritional epidemiology is human diet, which is a complex system of interacting components that cumulatively affect health. Consequently, nutritional epidemiology constantly faces a unique set of challenges and continually develops specific methodologies to address these. Misunderstanding these issues can lead to the nonconstructive and sometimes naive criticisms we see today. This article aims to clarify common misunderstandings of nutritional epidemiology, address challenges to the field, and discuss the utility of nutritional science in guiding policy by focusing on 5 broad questions commonly asked of the field.",0
25592230,"Primary and metastatic cancers that affect bones are frequently associated with severe and intractable pain. The mechanisms underlying the development of bone cancer pain are largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether inhibition of KCNQ/M (Kv7) potassium channels in the spinal cord contributes to the development of bone cancer pain via sensitization of dorsal horn wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons. Using a rat model of bone cancer pain based on intratibial injection of MRMT-1 tumor cells, we observed a significant increase in C-fiber responses of dorsal horn WDR neurons in the MRMT-1 injected rats, indicating sensitization of spinal WDR neurons in bone cancer rats. Furthermore, we discovered that blockade of KCNQ/M channels in the spinal cord by local administration of XE-991, a specific KCNQ/M channel blocker, caused a robust increase in excitability of dorsal horn WDR neurons, while, producing obvious pain hypersensitivity in normal rats. On the contrary, activation of spinal KCNQ/M channels by retigabine, a selective KCNQ/M channel opener, not only inhibited the bone cancer‑induced hyperexcitability of dorsal horn WDR neurons, but also alleviated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in the bone cancer rats, while all of these effects of retigabine could be blocked by KCNQ/M-channel antagonist XE-991. All things considered, these results suggest that suppression of KCNQ/M channels in the spinal cord likely contributes to the development of bone cancer pain via sensitization of dorsal horn WDR neurons in rats following tumor cell inoculation.",1

25585696,"An exploratory genome-wide copy number variant (CNV) study was performed in 127 independent cases with specific language impairment (SLI), their first-degree relatives (385 individuals) and 269 population controls. Language-impaired cases showed an increased CNV burden in terms of the average number of events (11.28 vs 10.01, empirical P=0.003), the total length of CNVs (717 vs 513 Kb, empirical P=0.0001), the average CNV size (63.75 vs 51.6 Kb, empirical P=0.0005) and the number of genes spanned (14.29 vs 10.34, empirical P=0.0007) when compared with population controls, suggesting that CNVs may contribute to SLI risk. A similar trend was observed in first-degree relatives regardless of affection status. The increased burden found in our study was not driven by large or de novo events, which have been described as causative in other neurodevelopmental disorders. Nevertheless, de novo CNVs might be important on a case-by-case basis, as indicated by identification of events affecting relevant genes, such as ACTR2 and CSNK1A1, and small events within known micro-deletion/-duplication syndrome regions, such as chr8p23.1. Pathway analysis of the genes present within the CNVs of the independent cases identified significant overrepresentation of acetylcholine binding, cyclic-nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity and MHC proteins as compared with controls. Taken together, our data suggest that the majority of the risk conferred by CNVs in SLI is via common, inherited events within a 'common disorder-common variant' model. Therefore the risk conferred by CNVs will depend upon the combination of events inherited (both CNVs and SNPs), the genetic background of the individual and the environmental factors.",1
25584894,"A functional genomics study revealed that the activity of acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) contributes to cancer cell growth under low-oxygen and lipid-depleted conditions. Comparative metabolomics and lipidomics demonstrated that acetate is used as a nutritional source by cancer cells in an ACSS2-dependent manner, and supplied a significant fraction of the carbon within the fatty acid and phospholipid pools. ACSS2 expression is upregulated under metabolically stressed conditions and ACSS2 silencing reduced the growth of tumor xenografts. ACSS2 exhibits copy-number gain in human breast tumors, and ACSS2 expression correlates with disease progression. These results signify a critical role for acetate consumption in the production of lipid biomass within the harsh tumor microenvironment.",1
25564025,"Simple sequence repeats (SSRs), or microsatellites are hyper-mutable and can lead to disorders. Here we explore SSR distribution in cell cycle-associated genes [grouped into: checkpoint; regulation; replication, repair, and recombination (RRR); and transition] in humans and orthologues of eight mammals. Among the gene groups studied, transition genes have the highest SSR density. Trinucleotide repeats are not abundant and introns have higher repeat density than exons. Many repeats in human genes are conserved; however, CG motifs are conserved only in regulation genes. SSR variability in cell cycle genes represents a genetic Achilles' heel, yet SSRs are common in all groups of genes. This tolerance many be due to i) positions in introns where they do not disrupt gene function, ii) essential roles in regulation, iii) specific value of adaptability, and/or iv) lack of negative selection pressure. Present study may be useful for further exploration of their medical relevance and potential functionality.",0

25469397,"Humans interact with food daily. Such repeated exposure creates a widespread, superficial familiarity with nutrition. Personal familiarity with nutrition from individual and cultural perspectives may give rise to beliefs about food not grounded in scientific evidence. In this summary of the session entitled “Unscientific Beliefs about Scientific Topics in Nutrition,” we discuss accumulated work illustrating and quantifying potentially misleading practices in the conduct and, more so, reporting of nutrition science along with proposed approaches to amelioration. We begin by defining “unscientific beliefs” and from where such beliefs may come, followed by discussing how large bodies of nutritional epidemiologic observations not only create highly improbable patterns of association but implausible magnitudes of implied effect. Poor reporting practices, biases, and methodologic issues that have distorted scientific understandings of nutrition are presented, followed by potential influences of conflicts of interest that extend beyond financial considerations. We conclude with recommendations for improving the conduct, reporting, and communication of nutrition-related research to ground discussions in evidence rather than solely on beliefs.",0

The MRS is a large, prospective study with longitudinal follow-up designed to identify risk and resiliency factors for combat-induced stress-related symptoms. Previously implicated PTSD risk loci from the literature and polygenic risk scores across psychiatric disorders were also evaluated in the MRS cohort.",1
25437880,"Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder that includes individuals with manifestations ranging from primary amenorrhea to loss of menstrual function prior to age 40. POF presents as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and can be part of a syndrome or occur in isolation. Here, we studied 3 sisters with primary amenorrhea, hypothyroidism, and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. The sisters were born to parents who are first cousins. SNP analysis and whole-exome sequencing revealed the presence of a pathogenic variant of the minichromosome maintenance 8 gene (MCM8, c.446C>G; p.P149R) located within a region of homozygosity that was present in the affected daughters but not in their unaffected sisters. Because MCM8 participates in homologous recombination and dsDNA break repair, we tested fibroblasts from the affected sisters for hypersensitivity to chromosomal breaks. Compared with fibroblasts from unaffected daughters, chromosomal break repair was deficient in fibroblasts from the affected individuals, likely due to inhibited recruitment of MCM8 p.P149R to sites of DNA damage. Our study identifies an autosomal recessive disorder caused by an MCM8 mutation that manifests with endocrine dysfunction and genomic instability.",1
25422273,"The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (the Academy) and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.), utilizing an evidence-informed, consensus-derived process, recommend that a standardized set of diagnostic indicators be used to identify and document pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) in routine clinical practice. The recommended indicators include z scores for weight-for-height/length, body mass index-for-age, or length/height-for-age or mid-upper arm circumference when a single data point is available. When 2 or more data points are available, indicators may also include weight gain velocity (<2 years of age), weight loss (2-20 years of age), deceleration in weight for length/height z score, and inadequate nutrient intake. The purpose of this consensus statement is to identify a basic set of indicators that can be used to diagnose and document undernutrition in the pediatric population ages 1 month to 18 years. The indicators are intended for use in multiple settings (eg, acute, ambulatory care/outpatient, residential care). Several screening tools have been developed for use in hospitalized children. However, identifying criteria for use in screening for nutritional risk is not the purpose of this paper. Clinicians should use as many data points as available to identify and document the presence of malnutrition. The universal use of a single set of diagnostic parameters will expedite the recognition of pediatric undernutrition, lead to the development of more accurate estimates of its prevalence and incidence, direct interventions, and promote improved outcomes. A standardized diagnostic approach will also inform the prediction of the human and financial responsibilities and costs associated with the prevention and treatment of undernutrition in this vulnerable population and help to further ensure the provision of high-quality, cost-effective nutritional care.",0
25403273,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an RNA-mediated disorder characterized by muscle weakness, cardiac defects and multiple symptoms and is caused by expanded CTG repeats within the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. In this study, we found abnormal splicing of actin-binding LIM protein 1 (ABLIM1) in skeletal muscles of patients with DM1 and a DM1 mouse model (HSA(LR) ). An exon 11 inclusion isoform is expressed in skeletal muscle and heart of non-DM1 individuals, but not in skeletal muscle of patients with DM1 or other adult human tissues. Moreover, we determined that ABLIM1 splicing is regulated by several splice factors, including MBNL family proteins, CELF1, 2 and 6, and PTBP1, using a cellular splicing assay. MBNL proteins promoted the inclusion of ABLIM1 exon 11, but other proteins and expanded CUG repeats repressed exon 11 of ABLIM1. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that MBNL proteins are trapped by expanded CUG repeats and inactivated in DM1 and that CELF1 is activated in DM1. However, activation of PTBP1 has not been reported in DM1. Our results suggest that the exon 11 inclusion isoform of ABLIM1 may have a muscle-specific function, and its abnormal splicing could be related to muscle symptoms of DM1.",1
25398735,"Sleep is an essential lifestyle factor that contributes to overall health. The inverse relation between sleep duration and weight status has revealed the importance of sleep in nutritional health. This integrative review builds foundational knowledge with regard to sleep vis-à-vis nutrition by summarizing the importance and process of sleep, current sleep recommendations and trends, as well as lifestyle contributors to poor sleep. Additionally, it details the association between sleep and obesity and potential mechanisms for this association. Furthermore, guidance is offered regarding the incorporation of sleep considerations in nutrition counseling, communication, and research. Like many other lifestyle factors that contribute to nutritional health, sleep needs to be considered when examining weight management and health promotion.",0
25394406,"Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are devices that use living microbes for the conversion of organic matter into electricity. MFC systems can be applied to the generation of electricity at water/sediment interfaces in the environment, such as bay areas, wetlands, and rice paddy fields. Using these systems, electricity generation in paddy fields as high as ∼80 mW m(-2) (based on the projected anode area) has been demonstrated, and evidence suggests that rhizosphere microbes preferentially utilize organic exudates from rice roots for generating electricity. Phylogenetic and metagenomic analyses have been conducted to identify the microbial species and catabolic pathways that are involved in the conversion of root exudates into electricity, suggesting the importance of syntrophic interactions. In parallel, pot cultures of rice and other aquatic plants have been used for rhizosphere MFC experiments under controlled laboratory conditions. The findings from these studies have demonstrated the potential of electricity generation for mitigating methane emission from the rhizosphere. Notably, however, the presence of large amounts of organics in the rhizosphere drastically reduces the effect of electricity generation on methane production. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the potential of these systems for mitigating methane emission from rice paddy fields. We suggest that paddy-field MFCs represent a promising approach for harvesting latent energy of the natural world.",0
25390645,"Anxiety disorders (ADs) are common mental disorders caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Since ADs are highly comorbid with each other, partially due to shared genetic basis, studying AD phenotypes in a coordinated manner may be a powerful strategy for identifying potential genetic loci for ADs. To detect these loci, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ADs. In addition, as a complementary approach to single-locus analysis, we also conducted gene- and pathway-based analyses. GWAS data were derived from the control sample of the Molecular Genetics of Schizophrenia (MGS) project (2,540 European American and 849 African American subjects) genotyped on the Affymetrix GeneChip 6.0 array. We applied two phenotypic approaches: (1) categorical case-control comparisons (CC) based upon psychiatric diagnoses, and (2) quantitative phenotypic factor scores (FS) derived from a multivariate analysis combining information across the clinical phenotypes. Linear and logistic models were used to analyse the association with ADs using FS and CC traits, respectively. At the single locus level, no genome-wide significant association was found. A trans-population gene-based meta-analysis across both ethnic subsamples using FS identified three genes (MFAP3L on 4q32.3, NDUFAB1 and PALB2 on 16p12) with genome-wide significance (false discovery rate (FDR] <5%). At the pathway level, several terms such as transcription regulation, cytokine binding, and developmental process were significantly enriched in ADs (FDR <5%). Our approaches studying ADs as quantitative traits and utilizing the full GWAS data may be useful in identifying susceptibility genes and pathways for ADs.",1
25370573,"SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are frequently mutated in a variety of human cancers. We investigated the mutation incidence and the role of mSWI/SNF (BAF) complexes in human lung cancer. In the present study, we analyzed somatic mutations of BAF complexes and other driver mutated genes of lung carcinoma deposited in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database. BAF complexes were mutated in 282 of 803 (35.12%) lung carcinoma samples analyzed, ranking second to TP53. Significantly, BAF-mutated samples exhibited more genomic mutations than BAF wild-type ones. Moreover, a significant positive correlation existed between the BAF mutations and overall genomic mutations in these lung carcinoma samples (P<0.001, Pearson's correlation analysis). Specifically, the mutant-typing of 6 BAF genes, SMARCA4, ARID2, ARID1B, BCL11A, BCL11B and BRD9 was associated with more overall mutations in the lung carcinoma samples. A mutation reporter system was developed by means of the establishment of stable cell sublines with slippage-luciferase transcript in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line, Calu-3. SMARCA4, the most frequently mutated BAF gene in lung cancer, was stably knocked down by pSUPER constructs carrying short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Mutation ratios determined from the mutation reporters of Calu-3 cells were significantly increased upon stable SMARCA4 knockdown. We demonstrated that genetic mutations of BAF complexes lead to genome instability of lung carcinoma. Therefore, BAF complexes play an important role in maintaining genome stability in human lung cancer.",1
25366420,"The ErbB signalling network plays a crucial role in the growth and progression of several cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), and includes potentially drug-targetable genes. Oncogenic activation of the ErbB pathway by mutations and focal amplifications have emerged recently as an important predictive marker of the prognosis of CRC patients. However, in contrast to genetic events, little is known about epigenetic alternations of ErbB-associated genes and their impact on gene expression. Genome-wide methylation in sporadic CRCs (n = 12) paired with adjacent normal tissues have been previously analysed by Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 (HM27) at 27,578 CpG sites. For confirmation of our initial genome-wide analysis, we used a published HM27 dataset (GSE25062). Subsequently, CpG island methylation of selected ErbB pathway-associated genes was assessed on 233 CRC samples using methylation-sensitive polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) and analysed along with various genetic factors associated with CRC [epigenotype, BRAF and KRAS mutations, microsatellite instability (MSI)]. Methylation and expression integration was performed using published datasets including 25 pairs of CRC and normal colon tissues (GSE25062 and GSE25070), and confirmed with real-time PCR. Our previous microarray-based genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of 12 CRCs revealed that four ErbB-associated genes (PIK3CD, PKCΒ, ERBB4, ) were differentially methylated in CRCs. This was further confirmed by statistical re-analysis of an HM27 dataset (GSE25062). Frequent methylation at these loci in tumours was subsequently confirmed by MS-PCR (63%, 43%, 43% and 92%, respectively). Hypermethylation of PKCΒ associated with KRAS mutation (p = 0.04), whereas hypermethylation of ERBB4 associated with high-methylation epigenotypes (HME), BRAF mutation and MSI (p = 0.001, 0.002 and 0.0002, respectively). One of the four analysed genes (PKCΒ) was significantly downregulated in CRC tissue, as revealed by real-time PCR and re-analysis of the GSE25062 and GSE25070 datasets. After careful re-analysis of published methylation and expression data, we conclude that methylation of ERBB4, PAK7 and PIK3CD has no functional role in CRC carcinogenesis. In contrast, methylation seems to have a potential impact on the biology of colorectal tumours by negatively modulating the expression of PKCΒ. Importantly, the relationship between DNA methylation of PKCΒ and gene expression may warrant further attention in the context of colon cancer chemoprevention and anti-cancer therapy.",1
25364765,"Cardiovascular diseases and cancers are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that primarily repress target mRNAs. Here, miR-24, miR-125b, miR-195, and miR-214 were selected as representative cardio-miRs that are upregulated in human heart failure. To bridge the gap between miRNA studies in cardiology and oncology, the targets and functions of these miRNAs in cardiovascular diseases and cancers will be reviewed. ACVR1B, BCL2, BIM, eNOS, FGFR3, JPH2, MEN1, MYC, p16, and ST7L are miR-24 targets that have been experimentally validated in human cells. ARID3B, BAK1, BCL2, BMPR1B, ERBB2, FGFR2, IL6R, MUC1, SITR7, Smoothened, STAT3, TET2, and TP53 are representative miR-125b targets. ACVR2A, BCL2, CCND1, E2F3, GLUT3, MYB, RAF1, VEGF, WEE1, and WNT7A are representative miR-195 targets. BCL2L2, ß-catenin, BIM, CADM1, EZH2, FGFR1, NRAS, PTEN, TP53, and TWIST1 are representative miR-214 targets. miR-125b is a good cardio-miR that protects cardiomyocytes; miR-195 is a bad cardio-miR that elicits cardiomyopathy and heart failure; miR-24 and miR-214 are bi-functional cardio-miRs. By contrast, miR-24, miR-125b, miR-195, and miR-214 function as oncogenic or tumor suppressor miRNAs in a cancer (sub)type-dependent manner. Circulating miR-24 is elevated in diabetes, breast cancer and lung cancer. Circulating miR-195 is elevated in acute myocardial infarction, breast cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal adenoma. Circulating miR-125b and miR-214 are elevated in some cancers. Cardio-miRs and onco-miRs bear some similarities in functions and circulation profiles. miRNAs regulate WNT, FGF, Hedgehog and other signaling cascades that are involved in orchestration of embryogenesis and homeostasis as well as pathogenesis of human diseases. Because circulating miRNA profiles are modulated by genetic and environmental factors and are dysregulated by genetic and epigenetic alterations in somatic cells, circulating miRNA association studies (CMASs) within several thousands of cases each for common non-cancerous diseases and major cancers are necessary for miRNA-based diagnostics.",1
25325190,"An LC-MS/MS method was developed for the simultaneous determination of 15 water-soluble vitamins that are widely used as additives in beverages and dietary supplements. This combined method involves the following simple pre-treatment procedures: dietary supplement samples were prepared by centrifugation and filtration after an extraction step, whereas beverage samples were diluted prior to injection. Chromatographic analysis in this method utilised a multi-mode ODS column, which provided reverse-phase, anion- and cation-exchange capacities, and therefore improved the retention of highly polar analytes such as water-soluble vitamins. Additionally, the multi-mode ODS column did not require adding ion pair reagents to the mobile phase. We optimised the chromatographic separation of 15 water-soluble vitamins by adjusting the mobile phase pH and the organic solvent. We also conducted an analysis of a NIST Standard Reference Material (SRM 3280 Multi-vitamin/Multi-element tablets) using this method to verify its accuracy. In addition, the method was applied to identify the vitamins in commercial beverages and dietary supplements. By comparing results with the label values and results obtained by official methods, it was concluded that the method could be used for quality control and to compose nutrition labels for vitamin-enriched products.",0
25323146,"This article presents an analysis of possibilities for electrical energy production by using municipal solid waste disposed in the biggest Brazilian cities. Currently, the municipal solid waste in Brazil is collected and disposed of at landfills, but there are also other technologies, which in addition to dealing with the garbage can also provide benefits in terms of energy provision. The following scenarios were studied in this work: electricity production from landfill gas (reference scenario); incineration of all municipal solid waste; anaerobic digestion of organic waste and incineration of refuse-derived fuel fractions after being separated in separation plants. According to this study, the biggest cities in Brazil generate about 18.9 million tonnes of municipal solid waste per year (2011), of which 51.5% is biogenic matter. The overall domestic consumption of electricity is 480,120 GWh y(-1) in Brazil and the municipal solid waste incineration in the 16 largest cities in the country could replace 1.8% of it using incinerators. The city of São Paulo could produce 637 GWh y(-1) with landfill gas, 2368 GWh y(-1) with incineration of municipal solid waste and 1177 GWh y(-1) with incineration of refuse-derived fuel. The latter two scenarios could replace 27% and 13.5% of the residential electrical energy consumption in the city. This shows that thermal treatment might be a viable option of waste-to-energy in Brazil.",0
25315378,"Limited data is available on the genetic features of primary leptomeningeal melanocytic neoplasms (LMNs). Similarities with uveal melanoma were recently suggested as both entities harbor oncogenic mutations in GNAQ and GNA11. Whether primary LMNs share additional genetic alterations with uveal melanoma including copy number variations is unknown. Twenty primary LMNs ranging from benign and intermediate-grade melanocytomas to melanomas were tested by direct sequencing for hotspot mutations in the genes GNA11, GNAQ, BRAF, NRAS and HRAS. Furthermore, the lesions were tested for copy number variations of chromosomes frequently present in uveal melanoma (1p, 3, 6 and 8q) by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Genome-wide analyses of copy number alterations of two leptomeningeal melanocytic neoplasms were performed using the OncoScan SNP-array. GNAQ(Q209) mutations were present in eleven LMNs, while two of 20 cases carried a GNA11(Q209) mutation. No BRAF, HRAS or NRAS hotspot mutations were detected. Monosomy 3 and gain of 8q were present in one leptomeningeal melanoma, and one intermediate-grade melanocytoma harbored a gain of chromosome 6. With MLPA, the melanocytomas did not show any further gross chromosomal variations. Our data shows that primary LMNs, like uveal melanoma, harbor oncogenic mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 but lack mutations in BRAF, NRAS and HRAS. This finding may help in the differential diagnosis between a primary LMN and a metastasis from a cutaneous melanoma to the central nervous system. Copy number variations in some aggressive LMNs resemble those present in uveal melanoma but their prognostic significance is unclear.",1

25293813,"Obesity, an increasingly frequent societal disease can also be accompanied by declines in spermatozoa quality and male subfecundity. To determine if there are obesity-associated proteomic changes potentially affecting sperm quality and motility, differential proteomic analysis was performed on spermatozoa from both obesity-associated asthenozoospermia and clinically healthy individuals, using a label-free quantitative LC-MS/MS approach. We resolved 1975 proteins in the human sperm proteome, amongst which, 105 proteins were less abundant, whereas 22 other proteins increased in obesity-associated asthenozoospermia. Functional category analyses indicated that the differentially expressed proteins are mainly related to cytoskeletal regulation, vesicle biogenesis, metabolism, and protein degradation involved in spermiogenesis and sperm motility. Furthermore, declines in endoplasmic reticulum protein 57 (ERp57) and actin-binding-related protein T2 (ACTRT2) expression were verified by immunofluorescence, Western blot, and flow cytometry analyses. It is evident that ERp57 is localized in the acrosome region, neck and principal piece of human spermatozoa, whereas ACTRT2 is localized in the post-acrosomal region and middle piece. Thus, these differences in protein expression in asthenozoospermia may contribute to the underlying sperm quality defects afflicting these individuals. Notably, declines in ERp57 and ACTRT2 expression in obesity-associated asthenozoospermia may play critical roles in reducing sperm motility.",1
25284319,"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with high heritability. At least 30% of patients diagnosed in childhood continue to suffer from ADHD during adulthood and genetic risk factors may play an essential role in the persistence of the disorder throughout lifespan. To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ADHD have been completed in seven independent datasets, six of which were pediatric samples and one on persistent ADHD using a DNA-pooling strategy, but none of them reported genome-wide significant associations. In an attempt to unravel novel genes for the persistence of ADHD into adulthood, we conducted the first two-stage GWAS in adults with ADHD. The discovery sample included 607 ADHD cases and 584 controls. Top signals were subsequently tested for replication in three independent follow-up samples of 2104 ADHD patients and 1901 controls. None of the findings exceeded the genome-wide threshold for significance (PGC<5e-08), but we found evidence for the involvement of the FBXO33 (F-box only protein 33) gene in combined ADHD in the discovery sample (P=9.02e-07) and in the joint analysis of both stages (P=9.7e-03). Additional evidence for a FBXO33 role in ADHD was found through gene-wise and pathway enrichment analyses in our genomic study. Risk alleles were associated with lower FBXO33 expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines and with reduced frontal gray matter volume in a sample of 1300 adult subjects. Our findings point for the first time at the ubiquitination machinery as a new disease mechanism for adult ADHD and establish a rationale for searching for additional risk variants in ubiquitination-related genes.",1
25271088,"We performed gene-environment interaction genome-wide association analysis (G × E GWAS) to identify SNPs whose effects on metabolic traits are modified by chronic psychosocial stress in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). In Whites, the G × E GWAS for hip circumference identified five SNPs within the Early B-cell Factor 1 (EBF1) gene, all of which were in strong linkage disequilibrium. The gene-by-stress interaction (SNP × STRESS) term P-values were genome-wide significant (Ps = 7.14E-09 to 2.33E-08, uncorrected; Ps = 1.99E-07 to 5.18E-07, corrected for genomic control). The SNP-only (without interaction) model P-values (Ps = 0.011-0.022) were not significant at the conventional genome-wide significance level. Further analysis of related phenotypes identified gene-by-stress interaction effects for waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, type II diabetes status, and common carotid intimal-medial thickness (CCIMT), supporting a proposed model of gene-by-stress interaction that connects cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor endophenotypes such as central obesity and increased blood glucose or diabetes to CVD itself. Structural equation path analysis suggested that the path from chronic psychosocial stress to CCIMT via hip circumference and fasting glucose was larger (estimate = 0.26, P = 0.033, 95% CI = 0.02-0.49) in the EBF1 rs4704963 CT/CC genotypes group than the same path in the TT group (estimate = 0.004, P = 0.34, 95% CI = -0.004-0.012). We replicated the association of the EBF1 SNPs and hip circumference in the Framingham Offspring Cohort (gene-by-stress term P-values = 0.007-0.012) as well as identified similar path relationships. This observed and replicated interaction between psychosocial stress and variation in the EBF1 gene may provide a biological hypothesis for the complex relationship between psychosocial stress, central obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.",1
25252943,"We describe the identification of zyxin as a regulator of synapse maintenance in mechanosensory neurons in C. elegans. zyx-1 mutants lacked PLM mechanosensory synapses as adult animals. However, most PLM synapses initially formed during development but were subsequently lost as the animals developed. Vertebrate zyxin regulates cytoskeletal responses to mechanical stress in culture. Our work provides in vivo evidence in support of such a role for zyxin. In particular, zyx-1 mutant synaptogenesis phenotypes were suppressed by disrupting locomotion of the mutant animals, suggesting that zyx-1 protects mechanosensory synapses from locomotion-induced forces. In cultured cells, zyxin is recruited to focal adhesions and stress fibers via C-terminal LIM domains and modulates cytoskeletal organization via the N-terminal domain. The synapse-stabilizing activity was mediated by a short isoform of ZYX-1 containing only the LIM domains. Consistent with this notion, PLM synaptogenesis was independent of α-actinin and ENA-VASP, both of which bind to the N-terminal domain of zyxin. Our results demonstrate that the LIM domain moiety of zyxin functions autonomously to mediate responses to mechanical stress and provide in vivo evidence for a role of zyxin in neuronal development.",1
25237101,"The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the synapse between a motor neuron and skeletal muscle. Defects in NMJ transmission cause muscle weakness, termed myasthenia. The muscle protein Dok-7 is essential for activation of the receptor kinase MuSK, which governs NMJ formation, and DOK7 mutations underlie familial limb-girdle myasthenia (DOK7 myasthenia), a neuromuscular disease characterized by small NMJs. Here, we show in a mouse model of DOK7 myasthenia that therapeutic administration of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector encoding the human DOK7 gene resulted in an enlargement of NMJs and substantial increases in muscle strength and life span. When applied to model mice of another neuromuscular disorder, autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, DOK7 gene therapy likewise resulted in enlargement of NMJs as well as positive effects on motor activity and life span. These results suggest that therapies aimed at enlarging the NMJ may be useful for a range of neuromuscular disorders.",1
25231882,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified multiple loci associated with the risk of CKD. Almost all risk variants are localized to the noncoding region of the genome; therefore, the role of these variants in CKD development is largely unknown. We hypothesized that polymorphisms alter transcription factor binding, thereby influencing the expression of nearby genes. Here, we examined the regulation of transcripts in the vicinity of CKD-associated polymorphisms in control and diseased human kidney samples and used systems biology approaches to identify potentially causal genes for prioritization. We interrogated the expression and regulation of 226 transcripts in the vicinity of 44 single nucleotide polymorphisms using RNA sequencing and gene expression arrays from 95 microdissected control and diseased tubule samples and 51 glomerular samples. Gene expression analysis from 41 tubule samples served for external validation. 92 transcripts in the tubule compartment and 34 transcripts in glomeruli showed statistically significant correlation with eGFR. Many novel genes, including ACSM2A/2B, FAM47E, and PLXDC1, were identified. We observed that the expression of multiple genes in the vicinity of any single CKD risk allele correlated with renal function, potentially indicating that genetic variants influence multiple transcripts. Network analysis of GFR-correlating transcripts highlighted two major clusters; a positive correlation with epithelial and vascular functions and an inverse correlation with inflammatory gene cluster. In summary, our functional genomics analysis highlighted novel genes and critical pathways associated with kidney function for future analysis.",1
25222562,"Elucidation of the sperm-egg interaction at the molecular level is one of the unresolved problems in sexual reproduction, and understanding the molecular mechanism is crucial in solving problems in infertility and failed in vitro fertilization (IVF). Many molecular interactions in the form of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) mediate the sperm-egg membrane interaction. Due to the complexity of the problem such as difficulties in analyzing in vivo membrane PPIs, many efforts have failed to comprehensively elucidate the fusion mechanism and the molecular interactions that mediate sperm-egg membrane fusion. The main purpose of this study was to reveal possible protein interactions and associated molecular function during sperm-egg interaction using a protein interaction network approach. Different databases have been used to construct the human sperm-egg interaction network. The constructed network revealed new interactions. These included CD151 and CD9 in human oocyte that interact with CD49 in sperm, and CD49 and ITGA4 in sperm that interact with CD63 and CD81, respectively, in the oocyte. These results showed that the different integrins in sperm may be involved in human sperm-egg interaction. It was also suggested that sperm ADAM2 plays a role as a protein candidate involved in sperm-egg membrane interaction by interacting with CD9 in the oocyte. Interleukin-4 receptor activity, receptor signaling protein tyrosine kinase activity, and manganese ion transmembrane transport activity are the major molecular functions in sperm-egg interaction protein network. The disease association analysis indicated that sperm-egg interaction defects are also reflected in other disease networks such as cardiovascular, hematological, and breast cancer diseases. By analyzing the network, we identified the major molecular functions and disease association genes in sperm-egg interaction protein. Further experimental studies will be required to confirm the significance of these new computationally resolved interactions and the genetic links between sperm-egg interaction abnormalities and the associated disease.",1
25192052,"Gemistocytic astrocytoma (World Health Organization grade II) is a rare variant of diffuse astrocytoma that is characterized by the presence of neoplastic gemistocytes and has a significantly less favorable prognosis. Other than frequent TP53 mutations (>80%), little is known about its molecular profile. Here, we show that gemistocytic astrocytomas carry a lower frequency of IDH mutations than fibrillary astrocytomas (74% vs 92%; p = 0.0255) but have profiles similar to those of fibrillary astrocytomas with respect to TERT promoter mutations (5% vs 0%), 1p/19q loss (10% vs 8%), and loss of heterozygosity 10q (10% vs 12%). Exome sequencing in 5 gemistocytic astrocytomas revealed homozygous deletion of genes at 19q13 (i.e. RRAS [related RAS viral oncogene homolog; 2 cases] and ERCC1 [excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency, complementation group 1; 1 case]). Further screening showed RRAS homozygous deletion in 7 of 42 (17%) gemistocytic astrocytomas and in 3 of 24 (13%) IDH1 mutated secondary glioblastomas. Patients with gemistocytic astrocytoma and secondary glioblastoma with an RRAS deletion tended to have shorter survival rates than those without deletion. Differential polymerase chain reaction and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction revealed an ERCC1 homozygous deletion or promoter methylation in 10 of 42 (24%) gemistocytic astrocytomas and in 8 of 24 (33%) secondary glioblastomas. Alterations in RRAS and ERCC1 appear to be typical in gemistocytic astrocytomas and secondary glioblastomas, since they were not present in 49 fibrillary astrocytomas or 30 primary glioblastomas.",1
25177364,"Advances in genome-wide molecular cytogenetics allow identification of novel submicroscopic DNA copy number alterations (aCNAs) and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnLOH) resulting in homozygosity for known gene mutations in myeloid neoplasms. We describe the use of an oligo-SNP array for genomic profiling of aCNA and cnLOH, together with sequence analysis of recurrently mutated genes, in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) presenting with normal karyotype and FISH results. Oligo-SNP array analysis revealed a hemizygous deletion of 896 kb at chromosome 5q31.2, representing the smallest 5q deletion reported to date. The deletion involved multiple genes, including two tumor suppressor candidate genes (CTNNA1 and HSPA9) that are associated with MDS/AML. The SNP-array study also detected 3 segments of somatic cnLOH: one involved the entire long arm of chromosome 4; the second involved the distal half of the long arm of chromosome 7, and the third encompassed the entire chromosome 22 (UPD 22). Sequence analysis revealed mutations in TET2 (4q), EZH2 (7q), ASXL1 (20q11.21), and RUNX1 (21q22.3). Coincidently, TET2 and EZH2 were located at segments of cnLOH resulting in their homozygosity. Loss of heterozygosity affecting these two chromosomes and mutations in TET2 and EZH2 are indicative of a myelodysplastic syndrome with a poor prognosis. Deletion of the tumor suppressor genes CTNNA1 and HSPA9 is also likely to contribute to a poor prognosis. Furthermore, the original cnLOHs in multiple chromosomes and additional cnLOH 14q in the follow-up study suggest genetic evolution of the disease and poor prognosis. This study attests to the fact that some patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome who exhibit a normal karyotype may have underlying genetic abnormalities detectable by chromosomal microarray and/or targeted mutation analyses.",1
25175289,"While social scientists often highlight the way medical technologies mediate biomedical hegemony, this special issue focuses on the creative and often unexpected ways in which medical technologies are appropriated by diverse actors in homes, clinics and communities. The authors highlight key insights from twelve ethnographic case studies conducted in North and South America, Western Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. The case studies focus on, among other issues, how sperm donors in Denmark, despite being subjugated to medical surveillance, experience the act of donating sperm as liberating; how sex workers in Indonesia turn to psychoactive painkillers to feel confident when approaching clients; why some anorexic patients in the United States resist prescribed antidepressant drugs; and how adolescent sex education workshops in Ecuador are appropriated by mothers to monitor their daughters and shame their 'lying husbands'. Hardon and Moyer conclude that studies of medical technology need to be sensitive to the micro-dynamics of power, the specificities of local markets in which medical technologies generate value, the social and intergenerational relations in which they are embedded, and their intersections with class hierarchies.",0
25174685,"The term 'historical ecology' has been used with various meanings since the first half of the 20th century. Studies labelled as historical ecology have been produced in at least four academic disciplines: history, ecology, geography and anthropology. Although all those involved seem to agree that historical ecology concerns the historical interconnectedness of nature and human culture, this field of study has no unified methodology, specialized institutional background and common publication forums. Knowledge of the development of historical ecology is also limited. As a result, the current multitude of definitions of historical ecology is accompanied by divergent opinions as to where the origins of the field are to be sought. In this review, I follow the development of historical ecology from the 18th century to the present. In the first part, I briefly describe some early examples of historical ecological investigations, followed by a description of the various scientific strands in the 20th century that contributed to the formation of historical ecology. In the second part, I discuss the past five decades of historical ecological investigations in more detail, focusing mostly (but not exclusively) on works that their respective authors identified as historical ecology. I also examine the appearance and interconnectedness of the two main trends (ecological and anthropological) in historical ecological research. In the last part, I attempt to outline the future of historical ecology based on common features in existing research. It appears that at present historical ecology is at a crossroads. With rapidly growing interest in historical ecological research, it may move towards institutionalization or remain an umbrella term.",0
25159814,"The forces underlying genome architecture and organization are still only poorly understood in detail. Overlapping genes (genes partially or entirely overlapping) represent a genomic feature that is shared widely across biological organisms ranging from viruses to multi-cellular organisms. In bacteria, a third of the annotated genes are involved in an overlap. Despite the widespread nature of this arrangement, its evolutionary origins and biological ramifications have so far eluded explanation.",0
25153497,"Targeted inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are used for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Somatic mutations in the EGFR gene and key effectors of the EGFR-signaling pathway (KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA) are associated with sensitivity to these drugs. We developed a highly sensitive LUNG CANCER (LC)-biochip approach for the detection of the most common EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF gene mutations. The locked nucleic acid clamp PCR technique was used to increase the sensitivity of the assay, then allele-specific hybridization of a fluorescently labeled target on a biochip was performed. To prove the feasibility of the approach, clinical samples from 112 patients with NSCLC were analyzed. A total of 14 EGFR (12.5%) mutations, 21 (18.8%) KRAS mutations, 12 (10.7%) PIK3CA mutations, and 1 BRAF mutation (0.9%) were found. We compared the results with those from direct sequencing. We detected 50 different mutations by the LC-biochip assay and only 33 of them were found by direct sequencing. To demonstrate that the LC-biochip assay did not give false-positive results, the 17 specimens with discordant results were subjected to locked nucleic acid clamp PCR followed by sequencing. The results of this analysis were identical to the results obtained by the LC-biochip assay indicating that the biochip-based assay was both accurate and reliable. This approach was able to detect approximately 0.5% of mutated alleles in wild-type DNA background. The biochip-based assay is a reliable and inexpensive method for the identification of NSCLC patients, who may respond to a specific targeted therapy.",1
25149524,"Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is the second most common tumour of the head and neck. It is characterized by frequent aberrations in two cell-cycle regulators--CDKN2A and TP53. However, LSCC has been often studied as a part of the group of head and neck cancers and not as an individual entity. In the current study we aimed to examine mutation status of CDKN2A and TP53 genes in 108 LSCC patients. DNA was extracted from fresh-frozen tumour tissues; exons 1-3 of CDKN2A and exons 5-8 of TP53 were screened for mutations by direct sequencing. Genetic aberrations in CDKN2A were found in 16 (14.2%) and those in TP53--in 56/108 (51.9%) tumours. Seven mutations (two insertions, three deletions, one missense and one silent) detected in CDKN2A were not described previously. Also, we found seven novel deletions and a novel indel in TP53. No significant associations with clinical features were found. However, TP53 mutations were predominantly observed in smokers with advanced stage tumours. Screening for genetic aberrations in a defined group of LSCC contributes to the knowledge about laryngeal carcinogenesis. Further investigations are required to confirm the observed trends in associations with clinical features.",1
25120641,"Nucleoporin 214 (<i>NUP214)</i>, previously termed <i>CAN,</i> is required for cell cycle and nucleocytoplasmic transport. The genetic features and clinical implications of five <i>NUP214</i>-associated fusion genes are described in this review. <i>SET-NUP214</i> was most frequently observed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), concomitant with the elevated expression of <i>HOXA</i> cluster genes. Furthermore, the fusion transcript may be regarded as a potential minimal residual disease marker for <i>SET-NUP214</i>-positive patients. Episomal amplifications of <i>NUP214-ABL1</i> are specific to T-ALL patients. The <i>NUP214-ABL1</i> gene is observed in ~6% of T-ALL, in children and adults. Targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors plus standard chemotherapy appear to present a promising treatment strategy. <i>DEK-NUP214</i> is formed by the fusion of exon 2 of <i>DEK</i> and exon 6 of <i>NUP214</i>. Achieving molecular negativity of <i>DEK-NUP214</i> is of great importance for individual management. <i>SQSTM1-NUP214</i> and <i>NUP214-XKR3</i> were only identified in one T-ALL patient and one cell line, respectively. The <i>NUP214</i> fusions have significant diagnostic and therapeutic implications for leukemia patients. Additional <i>NUP214</i>-associated fusions require identification in future studies.",1
25111118,"Inherited diseases are the result of DNA sequence changes. In recessive diseases, the clinical phenotype results from the combined functional effects of variants in both copies of the gene. In some diseases there is often considerable variability of clinical presentation or disease severity, which may be predicted by the genotype. Additional effects may be triggered by environmental factors, as well as genetic modifiers which could be nucleotide polymorphisms in related genes, e.g. maternal ApoE or ABCA1 genotypes which may have an influence on the phenotype of SLOS individuals. Here we report the establishment of genotype variation databases for various rare diseases which provide individual clinical phenotypes associated with genotypes and include data about possible genetic modifiers. These databases aim to be an easy public access to information on rare and private variants with clinical data, which will facilitate the interpretation of genetic variants. The created databases include ACAD8 (isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IBD)), ACADSB (short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency), AUH (3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGCA)), DHCR7 (Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome), HMGCS2 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 deficiency), HSD17B10 (17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase X deficiency), FKBP14 (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with progressive kyphoscoliosis, myopathy, and hearing loss; EDSKMH) and ROGDI (Kohlschütter-Tönz syndrome). These genes have been selected because of our specific research interests in these rare and metabolic diseases. The aim of the database was to include all identified individuals with variants in these specific genes. Identical genotypes are listed multiple times if they were found in several patients, phenotypic descriptions and biochemical data are included as detailed as possible in view also of validating the proposed pathogenicity of these genotypes. For DHCR7 genetic modifier data (maternal APOE and ABCA1 genotypes) is also included. Databases are available at http://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes and will be updated based on periodic literature reviews and submitted reports.",1
25106621,"The majority of our knowledge about mitochondrial genomes of Viridiplantae comes from land plants, but much less is known about their green algal relatives. In the green algal order Sphaeropleales (Chlorophyta), only one representative mitochondrial genome is currently available-that of Acutodesmus obliquus. Our study adds nine completely sequenced and three partially sequenced mitochondrial genomes spanning the phylogenetic diversity of Sphaeropleales. We show not only a size range of 25-53 kb and variation in intron content (0-11) and gene order but also conservation of 13 core respiratory genes and fragmented ribosomal RNA genes. We also report an unusual case of gene arrangement convergence in Neochloris aquatica, where the two rns fragments were secondarily placed in close proximity. Finally, we report the unprecedented usage of UCG as stop codon in Pseudomuriella schumacherensis. In addition, phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial protein-coding genes yield a fully resolved, well-supported phylogeny, showing promise for addressing systematic challenges in green algae.",0
25098622,"In India, progress against undernutrition has been slow. Given its importance for income generation, improving diets, care practices, and maternal health, the agriculture sector is widely regarded as playing an important role in accelerating the reduction in undernutrition. This paper comprehensively maps existing evidence along agriculture-nutrition pathways in India and assesses both the quality and coverage of the existing literature. We present a conceptual framework delineating six key pathways between agriculture and nutrition. Three pathways pertain to the nutritional impacts of farm production, farm incomes, and food prices. The other three pertain to agriculture-gender linkages. After an extensive search, we found 78 research papers that provided evidence to populate these pathways. The literature suggests that Indian agriculture has a range of important influences on nutrition. Agriculture seems to influence diets even when controlling for income, and relative food prices could partly explain observed dietary changes in recent decades. The evidence on agriculture-gender linkages to nutrition is relatively weak. Sizeable knowledge gaps remain. The root causes of these gaps include an interdisciplinary disconnect between nutrition and economics/agriculture, a related problem of inadequate survey data, and limited policy-driven experimentation. Closing these gaps is essential to strengthening the agriculture sector's contribution to reducing undernutrition.",0
25060954,"Hearing function is known to be heritable, but few significant and reproducible associations of genetic variants have been identified to date in the adult population. In this study, genome-wide association results of hearing function from the G-EAR consortium and TwinsUK were used for meta-analysis. Hearing ability in eight population samples of Northern and Southern European ancestry (n = 4591) and the Silk Road (n = 348) was measured using pure-tone audiometry and summarized using principal component (PC) analysis. Genome-wide association analyses for PC1-3 were conducted separately in each sample assuming an additive model adjusted for age, sex and relatedness of subjects. Meta-analysis was performed using 2.3 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tested against each of the three PCs of hearing ability in 4939 individuals. A single SNP lying in intron 6 of the salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) gene was found to be associated with hearing PC2 (P = 3.7×10(-8)) and further supported by whole-genome sequence in a subset. To determine the relevance of this gene in the ear, expression of the Sik3 protein was studied in mouse cochlea of different ages. Sik3 was expressed in murine hair cells during early development and in cells of the spiral ganglion during early development and adulthood. Our results suggest a developmental role of Sik3 in hearing and may be required for the maintenance of adult auditory function.",1
25056994,"Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of chronic periodontitis (CP) offer rich data sources for the investigation of candidate genes, functional elements, and pathways. We used GWAS data of CP (n = 4,504) and periodontal pathogen colonization (n = 1,020) from a cohort of adult Americans of European descent participating in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study and employed a MAGENTA approach (i.e., meta-analysis gene set enrichment of variant associations) to obtain gene-centric and gene set association results corrected for gene size, number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and local linkage disequilibrium characteristics based on the human genome build 18 (National Center for Biotechnology Information build 36). We used the Gene Ontology, Ingenuity, KEGG, Panther, Reactome, and Biocarta databases for gene set enrichment analyses. Six genes showed evidence of statistically significant association: 4 with severe CP (NIN, p = 1.6 × 10(-7); ABHD12B, p = 3.6 × 10(-7); WHAMM, p = 1.7 × 10(-6); AP3B2, p = 2.2 × 10(-6)) and 2 with high periodontal pathogen colonization (red complex-KCNK1, p = 3.4 × 10(-7); Porphyromonas gingivalis-DAB2IP, p = 1.0 × 10(-6)). Top-ranked genes for moderate CP were HGD (p = 1.4 × 10(-5)), ZNF675 (p = 1.5 × 10(-5)), TNFRSF10C (p = 2.0 × 10(-5)), and EMR1 (p = 2.0 × 10(-5)). Loci containing NIN, EMR1, KCNK1, and DAB2IP had showed suggestive evidence of association in the earlier single-nucleotide polymorphism-based analyses, whereas WHAMM and AP2B2 emerged as novel candidates. The top gene sets included severe CP (""endoplasmic reticulum membrane,"" ""cytochrome P450,"" ""microsome,"" and ""oxidation reduction"") and moderate CP (""regulation of gene expression,"" ""zinc ion binding,"" ""BMP signaling pathway,"" and ""ruffle""). Gene-centric analyses offer a promising avenue for efficient interrogation of large-scale GWAS data. These results highlight genes in previously identified loci and new candidate genes and pathways possibly associated with CP, which will need to be validated via replication and mechanistic studies.",1

25045153,"This is an exciting time to be an evolutionary biologist. Indeed, it is difficult to keep up with all the studies that fall under the broad category of ""Evolution"" since they span species, traits, and scales of organization. This special issue gives a flavor of exciting new approaches in evolutionary biology, but also emphasizes universal themes. The reviews contained here discuss important aspects of molecular evolution at multiple scales, from individual proteins to complex regulatory networks, as well as from unicellular organisms to macroscopic traits in animals. Though the model systems are diverse, the issues addressed are fundamental: the origin of evolutionary novelties, and the forces that drive them to fixation.",0
25042175,"Identifying interesting relationships between pairs of genes, presented over some of experimental conditions in gene expression data set, is useful for discovering novel functional gene interactions. In this paper, we introduce a new method for id entifying L ocal C o-regulation R elationships (IdLCR). These local relationships describe the behaviors of pairwise genes, which are either up- or down-regulated throughout the identified condition subset. IdLCR firstly detects the pairwise gene-gene relationships taking functional forms and the condition subsets by using a regression spline model. Then it measures the relationships using a penalized Pearson correlation and ranks the responding gene pairs by their scores. By this way, those relationships without clearly biological interpretations can be filtered out and the local co-regulation relationships can be obtained. In the simulation data sets, ten different functional relationships are embedded. Applying IdLCR to these data sets, the results show its ability to identify functional relationships and the condition subsets. For micro-array and RNA-seq gene expression data, IdLCR can identify novel biological relationships which are different from those uncovered by IFGR and MINE.",1

24963828,"A significant fraction of our nation's electricity use goes to lift, convey, and treat water, while the resulting expenditures on electricity represent a key budgetary consideration for water service providers. To improve understanding of the electricity-for-water interdependency, electricity used in providing water services is mapped at the regional, state and county level for the 17-conterminous states in the Western U.S. This study is unique in estimating electricity use for large-scale conveyance and agricultural pumping as well as mapping these electricity uses along with that for drinking and wastewater services at a state and county level. Results indicate that drinking and wastewater account for roughly 2% of total West-wide electricity use, while an additional 1.2% is consumed by large-scale conveyance projects and 2.6% is consumed by agricultural pumping. The percent of electricity used for water services varies strongly by state with some as high as 34%, while other states expend less than 1%. Every county in the West uses some electricity for water services; however, there is a large disparity in use ranging from 10 MWh/yr to 5.8 TWh/yr. These results support long-term transmission planning in the Western U.S. by characterizing an important component of the electric load.",0
24954895,"Although age-dependent effects on blood pressure (BP) have been reported, they have not been systematically investigated in large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We leveraged the infrastructure of three well-established consortia (CHARGE, GBPgen, and ICBP) and a nonstandard approach (age stratification and metaregression) to conduct a genome-wide search of common variants with age-dependent effects on systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), mean arterial (MAP), and pulse (PP) pressure. In a two-staged design using 99,241 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 20 genome-wide significant (p ≤ 5 × 10(-8)) loci by using joint tests of the SNP main effect and SNP-age interaction. Nine of the significant loci demonstrated nominal evidence of age-dependent effects on BP by tests of the interactions alone. Index SNPs in the EHBP1L1 (DBP and MAP), CASZ1 (SBP and MAP), and GOSR2 (PP) loci exhibited the largest age interactions, with opposite directions of effect in the young versus the old. The changes in the genetic effects over time were small but nonnegligible (up to 1.58 mm Hg over 60 years). The EHBP1L1 locus was discovered through gene-age interactions only in whites but had DBP main effects replicated (p = 8.3 × 10(-4)) in 8,682 Asians from Singapore, indicating potential interethnic heterogeneity. A secondary analysis revealed 22 loci with evidence of age-specific effects (e.g., only in 20 to 29-year-olds). Age can be used to select samples with larger genetic effect sizes and more homogenous phenotypes, which may increase statistical power. Age-dependent effects identified through novel statistical approaches can provide insight into the biology and temporal regulation underlying BP associations.",1
24952511,"Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, is an aggressive mature NK-cell/T-cell lymphoma. Using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) assays, we screened genomic alterations and potential candidate genes implicated in pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis. Our array CGH analysis detected an average of 83 chromosomal aberrations in 13 cases, ranging from 0 to 387. There were 177 recurrent chromosomal gains and 35 recurrent losses. Eleven gains and 14 losses were detected in more than 30 % of the cases, including gains of 3q26.1, 7q34, and 8q24.3 and losses of 15q24.2, 19q13.32, 5p13.2, and 14q21.1. The most common losses were observed in the 15q24.2 and 19q13.32 regions (9 cases, 69.2 %, respectively). Loss of 8p11.23 was associated with significant poor survival (P = 0.024). Five out of six patients with the loss of 8p11.23 died within 8 months after initial diagnosis with a median survival of 6 months. Several candidate genes were identified in the regions with frequent chromosomal aberrations, including ADAM3A (8p11.23) and GSTT1 (22q11.23). In summary, our studies detected recurrent genetic alterations in NK/T-cell lymphoma, some of which are associated with adverse prognosis. Some candidate genes in these regions may be involved in the pathogenesis and disease progression.",1

24950379,"Low weight at birth has previously been shown to be associated with a number of adult diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and obesity later in life. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been published for singleton-born individuals, but the role of genetic variation in birth weight (BW) in twins has not yet been fully investigated. A GWAS was performed in 4,593 female study participants with BW data available from the TwinsUK cohort. A genome-wide significant signal was found in chromosome 9, close to the NTRK2 gene (OMIM: 600456). QIMR, an Australian twin cohort (n = 3,003), and UK-based singleton-birth individuals from the Hertfordshire cohort (n = 2,997) were used as replication for the top two single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) underpinning this signal, rs12340987 and rs7849941. The top SNP, rs12340987, was found to be in the same direction in the Australian twins and in the singleton-born females (fixed effects meta-analysis beta = -0.13, SE = 0.02, and p = 1.48 × 10-8) but not in the singleton-born males tested. These findings provide an important insight into the genetic component of BW in twins who are normally excluded due to their lower BW when compared with singleton births, as well as the difference in BW between twins. The NTRK2 gene identified in this study has previously been associated with obesity.",1
24944792,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality. Adenocarcinoma (AC) is the predominant histological type of NSCLC; however, AC consists of several subtypes. It has not yet been determined whether there is a correlation of CRKL and AXL expression with epidermal growth factor receptor (<i>EGFR</i>) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (<i>ALK</i>) gene status in lung AC. We assayed exons 18 through 21 of the <i>EGFR</i> gene by direct sequencing; <i>ALK</i> rearrangement and the expression of CRKL and AXL were detected by immunostaining. A total of 212 cases of AC were included in this study, diagnosed using the novel classification system established by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society in 2011, including 69 acinar ACs, 17 lepidic predominant ACs (LPAs), 63 papillary, 14 mucinous, 17 micropapillary and 32 solid ACs. Of the 212 cases, 101 harbored <i>EGFR</i> mutations. The most common subtypes carrying delK745-S753 were papillary and acinar ACs. <i>ALK</i> rearrangement was found in 23 cases (11%) of lung ACs. Acinar and solid ACs were the most frequent subtypes with <i>ALK</i> aberrance, particularly in acinar ACs with cribriform structure (4/5 cases, 80%). The expression of CRKL was significantly different among the AC subtypes (P=0.01), with the highest and lowest expression levels of CRKL protein in papillary ACs and LPAs, respectively (P<0.05). AXL expression was also significantly different among the AC subtypes (P=0.002) and was correlated with lymph node infiltration in acinar ACs. ACs with <i>EGFR</i> mutations exhibited high levels of AXL protein expression compared to those without mutations (P<0.001). Acinar AC with cribriform structure is a distinct subtype that frequently harbors <i>ALK</i> rearrangement. The activation of <i>AXL</i> may be one of the factors contributing to the invasion of acinar and micropapillary ACs.",1
24934184,"The primary aim of this study is to identify and analyze the importance of adverse drug reaction due to drug-drug interaction as a contributing factor towards drug safety. Patients more than 18 years of age admitted in multidisciplinary intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital were included in this study. Patients who stayed less than 48 h and patients in whom all treatment modalities have been withdrawn and were on comfort measures only (no drugs were prescribed), were excluded. All the drugs that were given during intensive care unit stay were checked for presence of potential interactions which led to adverse drug reaction. Drug-drug interactions that were detected clinically or through investigations were recorded and also any therapeutic actions taken for drug-drug interactions were noted. From June 2006 to April 2007, 400 patients-prescriptions were analyzed. Adverse drug reactions due to drug-drug interactions were identified in 64% patients. Among those patients 38.67% had a single drug-drug interaction. Potential drug-drug interactions were 602. Clinically significant drug-drug interactions among the potential were 208 (34.55%). Clinically relevant drug-drug interactions were 103 (49.52% of 208 episodes). The adverse drug reactions due to drug-drug interactions in our sample were managed either by substituting another drug (50.48% of 103 episodes) or by adjusting the dose (1% of 103 episodes) or by omitting the drug (48.54% of 103 episodes). Among the 208 observed drug-drug interactions induced adverse drug reactions 21.63% was severe drug-drug interactions induced adverse drug reactions, 23.08% was moderate drug-drug interactions induced adverse drug reactions and 55.29% was minor drug-drug interactions induced adverse drug reactions. The interactions which were life threatening and/ or require medical intervention to minimize or prevent serious adverse effects were considered as severe drug-drug interactions and those interaction which resulted in an exacerbation of the patient's condition and/ or require an alteration in therapy were considered as moderate drug-drug interactions. The interactions which were limited clinical effects and manifestations may include an increase in the frequency or severity of side effects but generally would not require a major alteration in therapy were classified as minor drug-drug interactions. The correlation coefficient was 0.86 between the number of drugs given to the patient & number of average potential adverse drug reactions found among the patients. Increase in number of prescribed drug significantly (one way) increases number of potential adverse drug reaction due to drug-drug interaction (p<0.0001). Critically ill patients are more susceptible to drug-drug interactions due to the administration of multiple drugs and complex drug combinations. Several drug-drug interactions were clinically irrelevant.",0
24916642,"The SNORD116 locus lies in the 15q11-13 region of paternally expressed genes implicated in Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), a complex disease accompanied by obesity and severe neurobehavioural disturbances. Cases of PWS patients with a deletion encompassing the SNORD116 gene cluster, but preserving the expression of flanking genes, have been described. We report a 23-year-old woman who presented clinical criteria of PWS, including the behavioural and nutritional features, obesity, developmental delay and endocrine dysfunctions with hyperghrelinemia. We found a paternally transmitted highly restricted deletion of the SNORD116 gene cluster, the shortest described to date (118 kb). This deletion was also present in the father. This finding in a human case strongly supports the current hypothesis that lack of the paternal SNORD116 gene cluster has a determinant role in the pathogenesis of PWS. Moreover, targeted analysis of the SNORD116 gene cluster, complementary to SNRPN methylation analysis, should be carried out in subjects with a phenotype suggestive of PWS.",1
24913650,"Our objective was to define and demonstrate a mechanistic model that enables dairy farmers to explore the impact of a technical or managerial innovation on electricity consumption, associated CO2 emissions, and electricity costs. We, therefore, (1) defined a model for electricity consumption on dairy farms (MECD) capable of simulating total electricity consumption along with related CO2 emissions and electricity costs on dairy farms on a monthly basis; (2) validated the MECD using empirical data of 1yr on commercial spring calving, grass-based dairy farms with 45, 88, and 195 milking cows; and (3) demonstrated the functionality of the model by applying 2 electricity tariffs to the electricity consumption data and examining the effect on total dairy farm electricity costs. The MECD was developed using a mechanistic modeling approach and required the key inputs of milk production, cow number, and details relating to the milk-cooling system, milking machine system, water-heating system, lighting systems, water pump systems, and the winter housing facilities as well as details relating to the management of the farm (e.g., season of calving). Model validation showed an overall relative prediction error (RPE) of less than 10% for total electricity consumption. More than 87% of the mean square prediction error of total electricity consumption was accounted for by random variation. The RPE values of the milk-cooling systems, water-heating systems, and milking machine systems were less than 20%. The RPE values for automatic scraper systems, lighting systems, and water pump systems varied from 18 to 113%, indicating a poor prediction for these metrics. However, automatic scrapers, lighting, and water pumps made up only 14% of total electricity consumption across all farms, reducing the overall impact of these poor predictions. Demonstration of the model showed that total farm electricity costs increased by between 29 and 38% by moving from a day and night tariff to a flat tariff.",0
24912477,"Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common primary liver tumor in children. Mutations in the β-catenin gene that lead to constitutive activation of the Wnt pathway have been detected in a large proportion of HB tumors. To identify novel mutations in HB, we performed whole-exome sequencing of six paired HB tumors and their corresponding lymphocytes. This identified 24 somatic nonsynonymous mutations in 21 genes, many of which were novel, including three novel mutations targeting the CTNNB1 (G512V) and CAPRIN2 (R968H/S969C) genes in the Wnt pathway, and genes previously shown to be involved in the ubiquitin ligase complex (SPOP, KLHL22, TRPC4AP, and RNF169). Functionally, both the CTNNB1 (G512V) and CAPRIN2 (R968H/S969C) were observed to be gain-of-functional mutations, and the CAPRIN2 (R968H/S969C) was also shown to activate the Wnt pathway in HB cells. These findings suggested the activation of the Wnt pathway in HB, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of the β-catenin in 42 HB tumors. We further used short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated interference to assess the effect of 21 mutated genes on HB cell survival. The results suggested that one novel oncogene (CAPRIN2) and three tumor suppressors (SPOP, OR5I1, and CDC20B) influence HB cell growth. Moreover, we found that SPOP S119N is a loss-of-function mutation in HB cells. We finally demonstrated that one of the mechanisms by which SPOP inhibits HB cell proliferation is through regulating CDKN2B expression.",1
24908601,"Many genetic factors have been implicated in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Although mutations associated with OSCC have been well documented, the rate of these mutations is known to vary by location. The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of RAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and TP53 mutations in OSCC within the Taiwanese population.",1
24904170,"Auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia are alleviated by antipsychotic agents that inhibit D2 dopamine receptors (Drd2s). The defective neural circuits and mechanisms of their sensitivity to antipsychotics are unknown. We identified a specific disruption of synaptic transmission at thalamocortical glutamatergic projections in the auditory cortex in murine models of schizophrenia-associated 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). This deficit is caused by an aberrant elevation of Drd2 in the thalamus, which renders 22q11DS thalamocortical projections sensitive to antipsychotics and causes a deficient acoustic startle response similar to that observed in schizophrenic patients. Haploinsufficiency of the microRNA-processing gene Dgcr8 is responsible for the Drd2 elevation and hypersensitivity of auditory thalamocortical projections to antipsychotics. This suggests that Dgcr8-microRNA-Drd2-dependent thalamocortical disruption is a pathogenic event underlying schizophrenia-associated psychosis.",1
24886261,"Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is the result of embryonic ductal plate malformation of the intrahepatic biliary tree. The phenotype consists of numerous cysts spread throughout the liver parenchyma. Cystic bile duct malformations originating from the peripheral biliary tree are called Von Meyenburg complexes (VMC). In these patients embryonic remnants develop into small hepatic cysts and usually remain silent during life. Symptomatic PLD occurs mainly in the context of isolated polycystic liver disease (PCLD) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). In advanced stages, PCLD and ADPKD patients have massively enlarged livers which cause a spectrum of clinical features and complications. Major complaints include abdominal pain, abdominal distension and atypical symptoms because of voluminous cysts resulting in compression of adjacent tissue or failure of the affected organ. Renal failure due to polycystic kidneys and non-renal extra-hepatic features are common in ADPKD in contrast to VMC and PCLD. In general, liver function remains prolonged preserved in PLD. Ultrasonography is the first instrument to assess liver phenotype. Indeed, PCLD and ADPKD diagnostic criteria rely on detection of hepatorenal cystogenesis, and secondly a positive family history compatible with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Ambiguous imaging or screening may be assisted by genetic counseling and molecular diagnostics. Screening mutations of the genes causing PCLD (PRKCSH and SEC63) or ADPKD (PKD1 and PKD2) confirm the clinical diagnosis. Genetic studies showed that accumulation of somatic hits in cyst epithelium determine the rate-limiting step for cyst formation. Management of adult PLD is based on liver phenotype, severity of clinical features and quality of life. Conservative treatment is recommended for the majority of PLD patients. The primary aim is to halt cyst growth to allow abdominal decompression and ameliorate symptoms. Invasive procedures are required in a selective patient group with advanced PCLD, ADPKD or liver failure. Pharmacological therapy by somatostatin analogues lead to beneficial outcome of PLD in terms of symptom relief and liver volume reduction.",1
24866174,"For more than 5000 years, organic-inorganic composite materials created by men via skill and serendipity have been part of human culture and customs. The concept of ""hybrid organic-inorganic"" nanocomposites exploded in the second half of the 20th century with the expansion of the so-called ""chimie douce"" which led to many collaborations between a large set of chemists, physicists and biologists. Consequently, the scientific melting pot of these very different scientific communities created a new pluridisciplinary school of thought. Today, the tremendous effort of basic research performed in the last twenty years allows tailor-made multifunctional hybrid materials with perfect control over composition, structure and shape. Some of these hybrid materials have already entered the industrial market. Many tailor-made multiscale hybrids are increasingly impacting numerous fields of applications: optics, catalysis, energy, environment, nanomedicine, etc. In the present feature article, we emphasize several fundamental and applied aspects of the hybrid materials field: bioreplication, mesostructured thin films, Lego-like chemistry designed hybrid nanocomposites, and advanced hybrid materials for energy. Finally, a few commercial applications of hybrid materials will be presented.",0
24866170,"The extent and role of aberrant DNA methylation in promoter CpG islands (CGIs) have been extensively studied in leukemia and other malignancies. Still, CGIs represent only a small fraction of the methylome. We aimed to characterize genome-wide differential methylation of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) cells compared with normal CD34(+) bone marrow cells using the Illumina 450K methylation array. Differential methylation in CN-AML was most prominent in genomic areas far from CGIs, in so called open sea regions. Furthermore, differential methylation was specifically found in genes encoding transcription factors (TFs), with WT1 being the most differentially methylated TF. Among genetic mutations in AML, DNMT3A mutations showed the most prominent association with the DNA methylation pattern, characterized by hypomethylation of CGIs (as compared with DNMT3A wild type cases). The differential methylation in DNMT3A mutant cells vs. wild type cells was predominantly found in HOX genes, which were hypomethylated. These results were confirmed and validated in an independent CN-AML cohort. In conclusion, we show that, in CN-AML, the most pronounced changes in DNA methylation occur in non-CGI regions and that DNMT3A mutations confer a pattern of global hypomethylation that specifically targets HOX genes.",1
24863970,"The National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Diseases Program evaluates patients for whom no diagnosis has been discovered despite a comprehensive diagnostic workup. Failure to diagnose a condition may arise from the mutation of genes previously unassociated with disease. However, we hypothesized that this could also co-occur with multiple genetic disorders. Demonstrating a complex syndrome caused by multiple disorders, we report two siblings manifesting both similar and disparate signs and symptoms. They shared a history of episodes of hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis, but had differing exam findings and developmental courses. Clinical acumen and exome sequencing combined with biochemical and functional studies identified three genetic conditions. One sibling had Smith-Magenis Syndrome and a nonsense mutation in the RAI1 gene. The second sibling had a de novo mutation in GRIN2B, which resulted in markedly reduced glutamate potency of the encoded receptor. Both siblings had a protein-destabilizing homozygous mutation in PCK1, which encodes the cytosolic isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-C). In summary, we present the first clinically-characterized mutation of PCK1 and demonstrate that complex medical disorders can represent the co-occurrence of multiple diseases.",1
24863034,"Genetic factors are important for the development of sarcopenia, a geriatric disorder characterized by low lean body mass. The aim of this study was to search for novel genes that regulate lean body mass in humans. We performed a large-scale search for 250K single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with bone mineral density (BMD) using SNP arrays in 1081 Japanese postmenopausal women. We focused on an SNP (rs12409277) located in the 5'-flanking region of the PRDM16 (PRD1-BF-1-RIZ1 homologous domain containing protein 16) gene that showed a significant P value in our screening. We demonstrated that PRDM16 gene polymorphisms were significantly associated with total body BMD in 1081 postmenopausal Japanese women. The rs12409277 SNP affected the transcriptional activity of PRDM16. The subjects with one or two minor allele(s) had a higher lean body mass than the subjects with two major alleles. Genetic analyses uncovered the importance of the PRDM16 gene in the regulation of lean body mass.",1
24840609,"Telomeres are repetitive sequences at the ends of chromosomes protected by DNA binding proteins of the shelterin complex that form capping structures. Through the interaction of shelterin complex-associated proteins, telomere length maintenance is regulated. Recently, the newly identified embryonic stem cell marker, Zinc finger and SCAN domain-containing 4 gene (Zscan4), was shown to be a telomere-associated protein, co-localizing to the shelterin complex. Furthermore, it was shown to play an essential role in genomic stability by regulating telomere elongation. Although it is known that Zscan4 regulates TRF2, POT1b, and Rap1 expression in embryonic stem cells, the relationship and the exact mechanism of action for ZSscan4-mediated telomere maintenance in cancer cells is unknown. In this study, we investigated Zscan4 expression and interactions with Rap1 in telomerase positive (HeLa, MCF7) and ALT pathway (SaOS2, U2OS) cancer cells. Through western, pulldown, siRNA, and overexpression assays we demonstrate, for the first time, that Zscan4 directly associates with Rap1 (physical association protein). Furthermore, by generating truncated versions of Zscan4, we identified its zinc finger domain as the Rap1 binding site. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation, we further validate this functional interaction in human cancer cells. Our results indicate that Zscan4 functions as a mediator of telomere length through its direct interaction with Rap1, possibly regulating shelterin complex-controlled telomere elongation in both telomerase positive and alternative lengthening of telomere pathways. This direct interaction between Zscan4 and Rap1 may explain how Zscan4 rapidly increases telomere length, yielding important information about the role of these proteins in telomere biology.",1
24836521,"All organisms use cofactors to extend the catalytic capacities of proteins. Many bacteria and archaea can synthesize cofactors from primary metabolites, but there are also prokaryotes that do not have the complete biosynthetic pathways for all essential cofactors. These organisms are dependent on the uptake of cofactors, or at least their precursors that cannot be synthesized, from the environment. Even in those organisms that contain complete biosynthetic pathways membrane transporters are usually present, because the synthesis of cofactors is more costly than uptake.",0
24833721,"Prion diseases (transmissible spongiform encephalopathies) are fatal neurodegenerative diseases, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, scrapie in sheep and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle. While genome-wide association studies in human and quantitative trait loci mapping in mice have provided evidence for multiple susceptibility genes, few of these have been confirmed functionally. Phenotyping mouse models is generally the method of choice. However, this is not a feasible option where many novel genes, without pre-existing models, would need to be tested. We have therefore developed and applied an in-vitro screen to triage and prioritize candidate modifier genes for more detailed future studies which is faster, far more cost effective and ethical relative to mouse bioassay models. An in vitro prion bioassay, the scrapie cell assay, uses a neuroblastoma-derived cell line (PK1) that is susceptible to RML prions and able to propagate prions at high levels. In this study, we have generated stable gene silencing and/or overexpressing PK1-derived cell lines to test whether perturbation of 14 candidate genes affects prion susceptibility. While no consistent differences were determined for seven genes, highly significant changes were detected for Zbtb38, Sorcs1, Stmn2, Hspa13, Fkbp9, Actr10 and Plg, suggesting that they play key roles in the fundamental processes of prion propagation or clearance. Many neurodegenerative diseases involve the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates and 'prion-like' seeding and spread has been implicated in their pathogenesis. It is therefore expected that some of these prion-modifier genes may be of wider relevance in neurodegeneration.",1
24831815,"Inherited hypertrichoses are rare syndromes characterized by excessive hair growth that does not result from androgen stimulation, and are often associated with additional congenital abnormalities. In this study, we investigated the genetic defect in a case of autosomal recessive congenital generalized hypertrichosis terminalis (CGHT) (OMIM135400) using whole-exome sequencing. We identified a single base pair substitution in the 5' donor splice site of intron 32 in the ABC lipid transporter gene ABCA5 that leads to aberrant splicing of the transcript and a decrease in protein levels throughout patient hair follicles. The homozygous recessive disruption of ABCA5 leads to reduced lysosome function, which results in an accumulation of autophagosomes, autophagosomal cargos as well as increased endolysosomal cholesterol in CGHT keratinocytes. In an unrelated sporadic case of CGHT, we identified a 1.3 Mb cryptic deletion of chr17q24.2-q24.3 encompassing ABCA5 and found that ABCA5 levels are dramatically reduced throughout patient hair follicles. Collectively, our findings support ABCA5 as a gene underlying the CGHT phenotype and suggest a novel, previously unrecognized role for this gene in regulating hair growth.",1
24823784,"Determining the methylation status of genes with pseudogenes can be technically challenging due to sequence homology. High sequence homology can result in the amplification of both pseudogene and parental gene alleles, potentially leading to data misinterpretation. Allelic bisulfite sequencing allows for detection of the methylation status of individual alleles at nucleotide resolution and represents the most reliable method for discriminating pseudogene and parental gene sequences. Here, we discuss important points that should be considered when investigating pseudogene and parental gene methylation status and we describe the method of allelic bisulfite sequencing, including assay design.",1
24806276,"Land use change in the Amazon rainforest alters the taxonomic structure of soil microbial communities, but whether it alters their functional gene composition is unknown. We used the highly parallel microarray technology GeoChip 4.0, which contains 83,992 probes specific for genes linked nutrient cycling and other processes, to evaluate how the diversity, abundance and similarity of the targeted genes responded to forest-to-pasture conversion. We also evaluated whether these parameters were reestablished with secondary forest growth. A spatially nested scheme was employed to sample a primary forest, two pastures (6 and 38 years old) and a secondary forest. Both pastures had significantly lower microbial functional genes richness and diversity when compared to the primary forest. Gene composition and turnover were also significantly modified with land use change. Edaphic traits associated with soil acidity, iron availability, soil texture and organic matter concentration were correlated with these gene changes. Although primary and secondary forests showed similar functional gene richness and diversity, there were differences in gene composition and turnover, suggesting that community recovery was not complete in the secondary forest. Gene association analysis revealed that response to ecosystem conversion varied significantly across functional gene groups, with genes linked to carbon and nitrogen cycling mostly altered. This study indicates that diversity and abundance of numerous environmentally important genes respond to forest-to-pasture conversion and hence have the potential to affect the related processes at an ecosystem scale.",0
24786473,"Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are commonly inactivated by somatic mutation and/or promoter methylation; yet, recent high-throughput genomic studies have not identified key TSGs inactivated by both mechanisms. We pursued an integrated molecular analysis based on methylation binding domain sequencing (MBD-seq), 450K Methylation arrays, whole exome sequencing, and whole genome gene expression arrays in primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors and matched uvulopalatopharyngoplasty tissue samples (UPPPs). We uncovered 186 downregulated genes harboring cancer specific promoter methylation including PAX1 and PAX5 and we identified 10 key tumor suppressor genes (GABRB3, HOXC12, PARP15, SLCO4C1, CDKN2A, PAX1, PIK3AP1, HOXC6, PLCB1, and ZIC4) inactivated by both promoter methylation and/or somatic mutation. Among the novel tumor suppressor genes discovered with dual mechanisms of inactivation, we found a high frequency of genomic and epigenomic alterations in the PAX gene family of transcription factors, which selectively impact canonical NOTCH and TP53 pathways to determine cell fate, cell survival, and genome maintenance. Our results highlight the importance of assessing TSGs at the genomic and epigenomic level to identify key pathways in HNSCC, deregulated by simultaneous promoter methylation and somatic mutations.",1
24770931,"Acyl-CoA synthetase 5 (ACSL5), a mitochondrially localized enzyme, catalyzes the synthesis of long-chain fatty acid thioesters and is physiologically involved in pro-apoptotic sensing of enterocytes. The aim of the present study is to identify an ACSL5-dependent regulation of mitochondrially expressed proteins and the characterization of related pathways in normal and diseased human intestinal mucosa. Proteomics of isolated mitochondria from ACSL5 transfectants and CaCo2 controls were performed. ACSL5-dependent protein synthesis was verified with quantitative reverse transcription plus the polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, short-interfering-RNA-mediated gene silencing and additional cell culture experiments. Lipid changes were analyzed with tandem mass spectrometry. ACSL5-related pathways were characterized in normal mucosa and sporadic adenocarcinomas of the human intestine. In CaCo2 cells transfected with ACSL5, mortalin (HSPA9) was about two-fold increased in mitochondria, whereas cytoplasmic mortalin levels were unchanged. Disturbance of acyl-CoA/sphingolipid metabolism, induced by ACSL5 over-expression, was characterized as crucial. ACSL5-related over-expression of mitochondrial mortalin was found in HEK293 and Lovo (wild-type TP53 [tumor protein p53]) and CaCo2 (p53-negative; TP53 mutated) cells but not in Colo320DM cells (mutated TP53). In normal human intestinal mucosa, an increasing gradient of both ACSL5 and mortalin from bottom to top was observed, whereas p53 (wild-type TP53) decreased. In sporadic intestinal adenocarcinomas with strong p53 immunostaining (mutated TP53), ACSL5-related mortalin expression was heterogeneous. ACSL5-induced mitochondrial mortalin expression is assumed to be a stress response to ACSL5-related changes in lipid metabolism and is regulated by the TP53 status. Uncoupling of ACSL5 and mitochondrial mortalin by mutated TP53 could be important in colorectal carcinogenesis.",1
24760004,"Lung cancer is the most common malignancy and the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. While smoking is by far the leading cause of lung cancer, other environmental and genetic factors influence the development and progression of the cancer. Since unique mutations patterns have been observed in individual cancer samples, identification and characterization of the distinctive lung cancer molecular profile is essential for developing more effective, tailored therapies. Until recently, personalized DNA sequencing to identify genetic mutations in cancer was impractical and expensive. The recent technological advancements in next-generation DNA sequencing, such as the semiconductor-based Ion Torrent sequencing platform, has made DNA sequencing cost and time effective with more reliable results. Using the Ion Torrent Ampliseq Cancer Panel, we sequenced 737 loci from 45 cancer-related genes to identify genetic mutations in 76 human lung cancer samples. The sequencing analysis revealed missense mutations in KRAS, EGFR, and TP53 genes in the breast cancer samples of various histologic types. Thus, this study demonstrates the necessity of sequencing individual human cancers in order to develop personalized drugs or combination therapies to effectively target individual, breast cancer-specific mutations.",1
24755198,"Next generation sequencing (NGS) has been used to characterize the overall genomic landscape of melanomas. Here, we systematically examined mutations from recently published melanoma NGS data involving 241 paired tumor-normal samples to identify potentially clinically relevant mutations. Melanomas were characterized according to an in-house clinical assay that identifies well-known specific recurrent mutations in five driver genes: BRAF (affecting V600), NRAS (G12, G13, and Q61), KIT (W557, V559, L576, K642, and D816), GNAQ (Q209), and GNA11 (Q209). Tumors with none of these mutations are termed ""pan negative."" We then mined the driver mutation-positive and pan-negative melanoma NGS data for mutations in 632 cancer genes that could influence existing or emerging targeted therapies. First, we uncovered several genes whose mutations were more likely associated with BRAF- or NRAS-driven melanomas, including TP53 and COL1A1 with BRAF, and PPP6C, KALRN, PIK3R4, TRPM6, GUCY2C, and PRKAA2 with NRAS. Second, we found that the 69 ""pan-negative"" melanoma genomes harbored alternate infrequent mutations in the five known driver genes along with many mutations in genes encoding guanine nucleotide binding protein α-subunits. Third, we identified 12 significantly mutated genes in ""pan-negative"" samples (ALK, STK31, DGKI, RAC1, EPHA4, ADAMTS18, EPHA7, ERBB4, TAF1L, NF1, SYK, and KDR), including five genes (RAC1, ADAMTS18, EPHA7, TAF1L, and NF1) with a recurrent mutation in at least two ""pan-negative"" tumor samples. This meta-analysis provides a road map for the study of additional potentially actionable genes in both driver mutation-positive and pan-negative melanomas.",1
24747642,"Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs) are aggressive cancers originating in the cortex of the adrenal gland. Despite overall poor prognosis, ACC outcome is heterogeneous. We performed exome sequencing and SNP array analysis of 45 ACCs and identified recurrent alterations in known driver genes (CTNNB1, TP53, CDKN2A, RB1 and MEN1) and in genes not previously reported in ACC (ZNRF3, DAXX, TERT and MED12), which we validated in an independent cohort of 77 ACCs. ZNRF3, encoding a cell surface E3 ubiquitin ligase, was the most frequently altered gene (21%) and is a potential new tumor suppressor gene related to the β-catenin pathway. Our integrated genomic analyses further identified two distinct molecular subgroups with opposite outcome. The C1A group of ACCs with poor outcome displayed numerous mutations and DNA methylation alterations, whereas the C1B group of ACCs with good prognosis displayed specific deregulation of two microRNA clusters. Thus, aggressive and indolent ACCs correspond to two distinct molecular entities driven by different oncogenic alterations.",1
24743840,"Dietary factors, including meat, fruits, vegetables and fiber, are associated with colorectal cancer; however, there is limited information as to whether these dietary factors interact with genetic variants to modify risk of colorectal cancer. We tested interactions between these dietary factors and approximately 2.7 million genetic variants for colorectal cancer risk among 9,287 cases and 9,117 controls from ten studies. We used logistic regression to investigate multiplicative gene-diet interactions, as well as our recently developed Cocktail method that involves a screening step based on marginal associations and gene-diet correlations and a testing step for multiplicative interactions, while correcting for multiple testing using weighted hypothesis testing. Per quartile increment in the intake of red and processed meat were associated with statistically significant increased risks of colorectal cancer and vegetable, fruit and fiber intake with lower risks. From the case-control analysis, we detected a significant interaction between rs4143094 (10p14/near GATA3) and processed meat consumption (OR = 1.17; p = 8.7E-09), which was consistently observed across studies (p heterogeneity = 0.78). The risk of colorectal cancer associated with processed meat was increased among individuals with the rs4143094-TG and -TT genotypes (OR = 1.20 and OR = 1.39, respectively) and null among those with the GG genotype (OR = 1.03). Our results identify a novel gene-diet interaction with processed meat for colorectal cancer, highlighting that diet may modify the effect of genetic variants on disease risk, which may have important implications for prevention.",1
24736735,"The phenotypic spectrum of GLI3 mutations includes autosomal dominant Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) and Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS). PHS was first described as a lethal condition associating hypothalamic hamartoma, postaxial or central polydactyly, anal atresia and bifid epiglottis. Typical GCPS combines polysyndactyly of hands and feet and craniofacial features. Genotype-phenotype correlations have been found both for the location and the nature of GLI3 mutations, highlighting the bifunctional nature of GLI3 during development. Here we report on the molecular and clinical study of 76 cases from 55 families with either a GLI3 mutation (49 GCPS and 21 PHS), or a large deletion encompassing the GLI3 gene (6 GCPS cases). Most of mutations are novel and consistent with the previously reported genotype-phenotype correlation. Our results also show a correlation between the location of the mutation and abnormal corpus callosum observed in some patients with GCPS. Fetal PHS observations emphasize on the possible lethality of GLI3 mutations and extend the phenotypic spectrum of malformations such as agnathia and reductional limbs defects. GLI3 expression studied by in situ hybridization during human development confirms its early expression in target tissues.",1
24736177,"Identifying genes that contribute to white matter microstructure should provide insights into the neurobiological processes that regulate white matter development, plasticity and pathology. We detected five significant SNPs using genome-wide association analysis on a global measure of fractional anisotropy in 776 individuals from large extended pedigrees. Genetic correlations and genome-wide association results indicated that the genetic signal was largely homogeneous across white matter regions. Using RNA transcripts derived from lymphocytes in the same individuals, we identified two genes (GNA13 and CCDC91) that are likely to be cis-regulated by top SNPs, and whose expression levels were also genetically correlated with fractional anisotropy. A transcript of HTR7 was phenotypically associated with FA, and was associated with an intronic genome-wide significant SNP. These results encourage further research in the mechanisms by which GNA13, HTR7 and CCDC91 influence brain structure, and emphasize a role for g-protein signaling in the development and maintenance of white matter microstructure in health and disease.",1
24728293,"Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis and is a major cause of pain and disability in the elderly. To search for sequence variants that confer risk of osteoarthritis of the hand, we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in subjects with severe hand osteoarthritis, using variants identified through the whole-genome sequencing of 2,230 Icelanders. We found two significantly associated loci in the Icelandic discovery set: at 15q22 (frequency of 50.7%, odds ratio (OR) = 1.51, P = 3.99 × 10(-10)) in the ALDH1A2 gene and at 1p31 (frequency of 0.02%, OR = 50.6, P = 9.8 × 10(-10)). Among the carriers of the variant at 1p31 is a family with several members in whom the risk allele segregates with osteoarthritis. The variants within the ALDH1A2 gene were confirmed in replication sets from The Netherlands and the UK, yielding an overall association of OR = 1.46 and P = 1.1 × 10(-11) (rs3204689).",1

24691875,"Deleterious effects of UV radiation in tissue are usually attributed to different mechanisms. Absorption of UVB radiation in cell constituents like DNA causes photochemical reactions. Absorption of UVA radiation in endogenous photosensitizers like vitamins generates singlet oxygen via photosensitized reactions. We investigated two further mechanisms that might be involved in UV mediated cell tissue damage. Firstly, UVB radiation and vitamins also generate singlet oxygen. Secondly, UVB radiation may change the chemical structure of vitamins that may change the role of such endogenous photosensitizers in UVA mediated mechanisms. Vitamins were irradiated in solution using monochromatic UVB (308 nm) or UVA (330, 355, or 370 nm) radiation. Singlet oxygen was directly detected and quantified by its luminescence at 1270 nm. All investigated molecules generated singlet oxygen with a quantum yield ranging from 0.007 (vitamin D3) to 0.64 (nicotinamide) independent of the excitation wavelength. Moreover, pre-irradiation of vitamins with UVB changed their absorption in the UVB and UVA spectral range. Subsequently, molecules such as vitamin E and vitamin K1, which normally exhibit no singlet oxygen generation in the UVA, now produce singlet oxygen when exposed to UVA at 355 nm. This interplay of different UV sources is inevitable when applying serial or parallel irradiation with UVA and UVB in experiments in vitro. These results should be of particular importance for parallel irradiation with UVA and UVB in vivo, e.g. when exposing the skin to solar radiation.",0
24687085,"Myeloid neoplasms and eosinophilia with rearrangements of PDGFRB are uncommon Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. Patients are typically male, with morphologic features of a Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with eosinophilia. Reciprocal translocations involving PDGFRB result in fusion genes with constitutively activated receptor tyrosine kinase sensitive to inhibition with imatinib. We present an updated and expanded analysis of a cohort of 26 such patients treated with imatinib. After a median follow-up of 10.2 years (range, 1.8-17 years), the 10-year overall survival rate was 90% (95% confidence interval, 64%-97%); after median imatinib duration of 6.6 years (range, 0.1-12 years), the 6-year progression-free survival rate was 88% (95% confidence interval, 65%-96%). Of the patients, 96% responded; no patients who achieved a complete cytogenetic (n = 13) or molecular (n = 8) remission lost their response or progressed to blast crisis. Imatinib is well-tolerated and achieves excellent long-term responses in patients with PDGFRB rearrangements.",1
24676022,"Megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) is a rare disorder of enteric smooth muscle function affecting the intestine and bladder. Patients with this severe phenotype are dependent on total parenteral nutrition and urinary catheterization. The cause of this syndrome has remained a mystery since Berdon's initial description in 1976. No genes have been clearly linked to MMIHS. We used whole-exome sequencing for gene discovery followed by targeted Sanger sequencing in a cohort of patients with MMIHS and intestinal pseudo-obstruction. We identified heterozygous ACTG2 missense variants in 15 unrelated subjects, ten being apparent de novo mutations. Ten unique variants were detected, of which six affected CpG dinucleotides and resulted in missense mutations at arginine residues, perhaps related to biased usage of CpG containing codons within actin genes. We also found some of the same heterozygous mutations that we observed as apparent de novo mutations in MMIHS segregating in families with intestinal pseudo-obstruction, suggesting that ACTG2 is responsible for a spectrum of smooth muscle disease. ACTG2 encodes γ2 enteric actin and is the first gene to be clearly associated with MMIHS, suggesting an important role for contractile proteins in enteric smooth muscle disease.",1
24670920,"Pulmonary carcinoids are rare neuroendocrine tumours of the lung. The molecular alterations underlying the pathogenesis of these tumours have not been systematically studied so far. Here we perform gene copy number analysis (n=54), genome/exome (n=44) and transcriptome (n=69) sequencing of pulmonary carcinoids and observe frequent mutations in chromatin-remodelling genes. Covalent histone modifiers and subunits of the SWI/SNF complex are mutated in 40 and 22.2% of the cases, respectively, with MEN1, PSIP1 and ARID1A being recurrently affected. In contrast to small-cell lung cancer and large-cell neuroendocrine lung tumours, TP53 and RB1 mutations are rare events, suggesting that pulmonary carcinoids are not early progenitor lesions of the highly aggressive lung neuroendocrine tumours but arise through independent cellular mechanisms. These data also suggest that inactivation of chromatin-remodelling genes is sufficient to drive transformation in pulmonary carcinoids.",1
24662834,"Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) represents an obstacle for cancer diagnosis and treatment, but little is known about its functional role in cancer progression.

Here, we show that invasive breast tumors exhibit significant ADAM23-ITH and that this heterogeneity is critical for tumor growth and metastasis. We demonstrate that while loss of ADAM23 expression enhances invasion, it causes a severe proliferative deficiency and is not itself sufficient to trigger metastasis. Rather, we observed that, in ADAM23-heterotypic environments, ADAM23-negative cells promote tumor growth and metastasis by enhancing the proliferation and invasion of adjacent A23-positive cells through the production of LGI4 (Leucine-rich Glioma Inactivated 4) and nitric oxide (NO). Ablation of LGI4 and NO in A23-negative cells significantly attenuates A23-positive cell proliferation and invasion. Our work denotes a driving role of ADAM23-ITH during disease progression, shifting the malignant phenotype from the cellular to the tissue level. Our findings also provide insights for therapeutic intervention, enforcing the need to ascertain ITH to improve cancer diagnosis and therapy.",1
24624044,"The paper focuses on the quantitative analysis of Israeli Government's targets of 10% renewable energy penetration by 2020 and determining the desired methodology (models) for assessing the effects on the electricity market, addressing the fact that Israel is an electricity island. The main objective is to determine the influence of achieving the Government's goals for renewable energy penetration on the need for backup in the Israeli electricity system. This work presents the current situation of the Israeli electricity market and the study to be taken in order to assess the undesirable effects resulting from the intermittency of electricity generated by wind and solar power stations as well as presents some solutions to mitigating these phenomena. Future work will focus on a quantitative analysis of model runs and determine the amounts of backup required relative to the amount of installed capacity from renewable resources.",0
24610814,"The recent discovery of numerous human short open reading frame (sORF)-encoded polypeptides (SEPs) has raised important questions about the functional roles of these molecules in cells. Here, we show that a 69-amino acid SEP, MRI-2, physically interacts with the Ku heterodimer to stimulate DNA double-strand break ligation via nonhomologous end joining. The characterization of MRI-2 suggests that this SEP may participate in DNA repair and underscores the potential of SEPs to serve important biological functions in mammalian cells.",1
24603532,"Anterior chamber depth (ACD) is a key anatomical risk factor for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG). We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on ACD to discover novel genes for PACG on a total of 5,308 population-based individuals of Asian descent. Genome-wide significant association was observed at a sequence variant within ABCC5 (rs1401999; per-allele effect size =  -0.045 mm, P = 8.17 × 10(-9)). This locus was associated with an increase in risk of PACG in a separate case-control study of 4,276 PACG cases and 18,801 controls (per-allele OR = 1.13 [95% CI: 1.06-1.22], P = 0.00046). The association was strengthened when a sub-group of controls with open angles were included in the analysis (per-allele OR = 1.30, P = 7.45 × 10(-9); 3,458 cases vs. 3,831 controls). Our findings suggest that the increase in PACG risk could in part be mediated by genetic sequence variants influencing anterior chamber dimensions.",1
24580753,"The genetic code is redundant, meaning that most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon. Highly expressed genes tend to use optimal codons to increase the accuracy and speed of translation. Thus, codon usage biases provide a signature of the relative expression levels of genes, which can, uniquely, be quantified across the domains of life.",0
24518671,"Glaucoma is a major cause of blindness in the world. To date, common genetic variants associated with glaucoma only explain a small proportion of its heritability. We performed a genome-wide association study of intra-ocular pressure (IOP), an underlying endophenotype for glaucoma. The discovery phase of the study was carried out in the TwinsUK cohort (N = 2774) analyzing association between IOP and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) imputed to HapMap2. The results were validated in 12 independent replication cohorts of European ancestry (combined N = 22 789) that were a part of the International Glaucoma Genetics Consortium. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses of the significantly associated SNPs were performed using data from the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource (MuTHER) Study. In the TwinsUK cohort, IOP was significantly associated with a number of SNPs at 9q33.3 (P = 3.48 × 10(-8) for rs2286885, the most significantly associated SNP at this locus), within the genomic sequence of the FAM125B gene. Independent replication in a composite panel of 12 cohorts revealed consistent direction of effect and significant association (P = 0.003, for fixed-effect meta-analysis). Suggestive evidence for an eQTL effect of rs2286885 was observed for one of the probes targeting the coding region of the FAM125B gene. This gene codes for a component of a membrane complex involved in vesicular trafficking process, a function similar to that of the Caveolin genes (CAV1 and CAV2) which have previously been associated with primary open-angle glaucoma. This study suggests a novel association between SNPs in FAM125B and IOP in the TwinsUK cohort, though further studies to elucidate the functional role of this gene in glaucoma are necessary.",1
24516586,"Nonsyndromic cleft palate (CP) is one of the most common human birth defects and both genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to its etiology. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 550 CP case-parent trios ascertained in an international consortium. Stratified analysis among trios with different ancestries was performed to test for GxE interactions with common maternal exposures using conditional logistic regression models. While no single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) achieved genome-wide significance when considered alone, markers in SLC2A9 and the neighboring WDR1 on chromosome 4p16.1 gave suggestive evidence of gene-environment interaction with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) among 259 Asian trios when the models included a term for GxE interaction. Multiple SNPs in these two genes were associated with increased risk of nonsyndromic CP if the mother was exposed to ETS during the peri-conceptual period (3 months prior to conception through the first trimester). When maternal ETS was considered, fifteen of 135 SNPs mapping to SLC2A9 and 9 of 59 SNPs in WDR1 gave P values approaching genome-wide significance (10(-6)<P<10(-4)) in a test for GxETS interaction. SNPs rs3733585 and rs12508991 in SLC2A9 yielded P = 2.26×10(-7) in a test for GxETS interaction. SNPs rs6820756 and rs7699512 in WDR1 also yielded P = 1.79×10(-7) and P = 1.98×10(-7) in a 1 df test for GxE interaction. Although further replication studies are critical to confirming these findings, these results illustrate how genetic associations for nonsyndromic CP can be missed if potential GxE interaction is not taken into account, and this study suggest SLC2A9 and WDR1 should be considered as candidate genes for CP.",1
24510258,"Fungal mitochondrial genomes act as ""reservoirs"" for homing endonucleases. These enzymes with their DNA site-specific cleavage activities are attractive tools for genome editing and gene therapy applications. Bioprospecting and characterization of naturally occurring homing endonucleases offers an alternative to synthesizing artificial endonucleases. Here, we describe methods for PCR-based screening of fungal mitochondrial rRNA genes for homing endonuclease encoding sequences, and we also provide protocols for the purification and biochemical characterization of putative native homing endonucleases.",0
24502653,"Despite the significant technical evolution of the blood purification methods, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients is still several times higher than that observed in the general population. Vitamins are playing a crucial role in multiple key metabolic pathways. Due to multiple factors, dialysis patients present very often hypo- or hypervitaminosis for a broad range of vitamins. Dialysis in the context of renal replacement therapy is associated with a non-physiological potassium-sparing dietetic regime. Additionally, there is a non-selective intradialytic loss of micro- and macronutrients, deranged intracellular kinetics and gastrointestinal malabsorption due to uratemia. Frequent treatment with antibiotics due to infections associated with the acquired uremia-related immunosuppression may derange the vitamin-producing intestinal microflora. Certain agents prescribed in the context of renal failure or other conditions may reduce the absorption of vitamins from the gastrointestinal tract. These factors may deplete a dialysis patient from vitamins, especially the ones with antioxidant activity that may be associated with cardioprotective properties. In other cases, vitamins metabolized and excreted by the kidneys may be accumulated and exert toxic effects. The scope of this paper is to describe the main issues on vitamin therapy in dialysis patients in view of the ever contradictory opinions and practices.",0
24493630,"Early-onset breast cancer (EOBC) causes substantial loss of life and productivity, creating a major burden among women worldwide. We analyzed 1,265,548 Hapmap3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among a discovery set of 3,523 EOBC incident cases and 2,702 population control women ages ≤ 51 years. The SNPs with smallest P values were examined in a replication set of 3,470 EOBC cases and 5,475 control women. We also tested EOBC association with 19,684 genes by annotating each gene with putative functional SNPs, and then combining their P values to obtain a gene-based P value. We examined the gene with smallest P value for replication in 1,145 breast cancer cases and 1,142 control women. The combined discovery and replication sets identified 72 new SNPs associated with EOBC (P < 4 × 10(-8)) located in six genomic regions previously reported to contain SNPs associated largely with later-onset breast cancer (LOBC). SNP rs2229882 and 10 other SNPs on chromosome 5q11.2 remained associated (P < 6 × 10(-4)) after adjustment for the strongest published SNPs in the region. Thirty-two of the 82 currently known LOBC SNPs were associated with EOBC (P < 0.05). Low power is likely responsible for the remaining 50 unassociated known LOBC SNPs. The gene-based analysis identified an association between breast cancer and the phosphofructokinase-muscle (PFKM) gene on chromosome 12q13.11 that met the genome-wide gene-based threshold of 2.5 × 10(-6). In conclusion, EOBC and LOBC seem to have similar genetic etiologies; the 5q11.2 region may contain multiple distinct breast cancer loci; and the PFKM gene region is worthy of further investigation. These findings should enhance our understanding of the etiology of breast cancer.",1
24491449,"Malignant Mesothelioma (MM) is a very aggressive cancer with low survival rates and often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Several players have been implicated in the development of this cancer, such as asbestos, erionite and the simian virus 40 (SV40). Here, we have reviewed the involvement of erionite, SV40, as well as, the role of several genes (p16(INK4a), p14(ARF), NF2, LATS2, SAV, CTNNB1 and among others), the pathways (RAS, PI3K, Wnt, BCL and Hippo), and their respective roles in the development of MM.",1

24457462,"Myxoid and round-cell liposarcoma is a frequently encountered liposarcoma subtype. The mainstay of treatment remains surgical excision with or without chemoradiation. However, treatment options are limited in the setting of metastatic disease. Cancer-testis antigens are immunogenic antigens with the expression largely restricted to testicular germ cells and various malignancies, making them attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy. Gene expression studies have reported the expression of various cancer-testis antigens in liposarcoma, with mRNA expression of CTAG1B, CTAG2, MAGEA9, and PRAME described specifically in myxoid and round-cell liposarcoma. Herein, we further explore the expression of the cancer-testis antigens MAGEA1, ACRBP, PRAME, and SSX2 in myxoid and round-cell liposarcoma by immunohistochemistry in addition to determining mRNA levels of CTAG2 (LAGE-1), PRAME, and MAGEA3 by quantitative real-time PCR. Samples in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks (n=37) and frozen tissue (n=8) were obtained for immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively. Full sections were stained with antibodies to MAGEA1, ACRBP, PRAME, and SSX2 and staining was assessed for intensity (1-2+) and percent tumor positivity. The gene expression levels of CTAG2, PRAME, and MAGEA3 were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. In total, 37/37 (100%) of the samples showed predominantly strong, homogenous immunoreactivity for PRAME. There was a variable, focal expression of MAGEA1 (11%) and SSX2 (16%) and no expression of ACRBP. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated PRAME and CTAG2 transcripts in all eight samples: six tumors with high mRNA levels; two tumors with low mRNA levels. The gene expression of MAGEA3 was not detected in the majority of cases. In conclusion, myxoid and round-cell liposarcomas consistently express PRAME by immunohistochemistry as well as CTAG2 and PRAME by qualitative real-time PCR. This supports the use of cancer-testis antigen-targeted immunotherapy in the treatment of this malignancy.",1
24423940,"Genome sequencing efforts have identified many uncharacterized lipase/esterase enzymes that have potential to be drug targets for metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. However, sequence information and associated structural predictions provide only a loose framework for linking enzyme function to disease risk. We are now confronted with the challenge of functionally annotating a large number of uncharacterized lipases, with the goal of generating new therapies for metabolic diseases. This daunting challenge involves gathering not only sequence-driven predictions, but also more importantly structural, biochemical (substrates and products), and physiological data. At the center of such drug discovery efforts are accurately identifying physiologically relevant substrates and products of individual lipases, and determining whether newly identified substrates/products can modulate disease in appropriate preclinical animal model systems. This review describes the importance of coupling in vivo metabolite profiling to in vitro enzymology as a powerful means to assign lipase function in disease specific contexts using animal models. In particular, we highlight recent examples using this multidisciplinary approach to functionally annotate genes within the α/β hydrolase fold domain (ABHD) family of enzymes. These new discoveries within the ABHD enzyme family serve as powerful examples of linking novel lipase function to human disease. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Tools to study lipid functions.",1
24413707,"Although many large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been performed, only a few studies have successfully identified replicable, large-impact hypertension loci; even fewer studies have been done on Chinese subjects. Young-onset hypertension (YOH) is considered to be a more promising target disorder to investigate than late-onset hypertension because of its stronger genetic component.",0
24389310,"Mastocytosis is a rare and chronic disease with phenotypes ranging from indolent to severe. Prognosis for this disease is variable and very few biomarkers to predict disease evolution or outcome are currently known. We have performed comprehensive screening in our large cohort of mastocytosis patients for mutations previously found in other myeloid diseases and that could serve as prognostic indicators. KIT, SRSF2-P95 and TET2 mutations were by far the most frequent, detected in 81%, 24% and 21% of patients, respectively. Where TET2 and SRSF2-P95 mutation both correlated with advanced disease phenotypes, SRSF2-P95 hotspot mutation was found almost exclusively in patients diagnosed with associated clonal hematologic non-mast cell disease. Statistically, TET2 and SRSF2-P95 mutations were highly associated, suggesting a mechanistic link between these two factors. Finally, analysis of both clonal and sorted cell populations from patients confirms the presence of these mutations in the mast cell component of the disease, suggests an ontological mutation hierarchy and provides evidence for the expansion of multiple clones. This highlights the prognostic potential of such approaches, if applied systematically, for delineating the roles of specific mutations in predisposing and/or driving distinct disease phenotypes.",1
24379610,"High-throughput short-read sequencing of exomes and whole cancer genomes in multiple human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cohorts confirmed previously identified frequently mutated somatic genes, such as TP53, CTNNB1 and AXIN1, and identified several novel genes with moderate mutation frequencies, including ARID1A, ARID2, MLL, MLL2, MLL3, MLL4, IRF2, ATM, CDKN2A, FGF19, PIK3CA, RPS6KA3, JAK1, KEAP1, NFE2L2, C16orf62, LEPR, RAC2, and IL6ST. Functional classification of these mutated genes suggested that alterations in pathways participating in chromatin remodeling, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, JAK/STAT signaling, and oxidative stress play critical roles in HCC tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, because there are few druggable genes used in HCC therapy, the identification of new therapeutic targets through integrated genomic approaches remains an important task. Because a large amount of HCC genomic data genotyped by high density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays is deposited in the public domain, copy number alteration (CNA) analyses of these arrays is a cost-effective way to reveal target genes through profiling of recurrent and overlapping amplicons, homozygous deletions and potentially unbalanced chromosomal translocations accumulated during HCC progression. Moreover, integration of CNAs with other high-throughput genomic data, such as aberrantly coding transcriptomes and non-coding gene expression in human HCC tissues and rodent HCC models, provides lines of evidence that can be used to facilitate the identification of novel HCC target genes with the potential of improving the survival of HCC patients.",1
24376456,"Alcohol consumption is a known risk factor for hypertension, with recent candidate studies implicating gene-alcohol interactions in blood pressure (BP) regulation. We used 6882 (predominantly) Caucasian participants aged 20-80 years from the Framingham SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe) to perform a genome-wide analysis of SNP-alcohol interactions on BP traits. We used a two-step approach in the ABEL suite to examine genetic interactions with three alcohol measures (ounces of alcohol consumed per week, drinks consumed per week, and the number of days drinking alcohol per week) on four BP traits [systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), mean arterial (MAP), and pulse (PP) pressure]. In the first step, we fit a linear mixed model of each BP trait onto age, sex, BMI, and antihypertensive medication while accounting for the phenotypic correlation among relatives. In the second step, we conducted 1 degree-of-freedom (df) score tests of the SNP main effect, alcohol main effect, and SNP-alcohol interaction using the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of the parameters from the first step. We then calculated the joint 2 df score test of the SNP main effect and SNP-alcohol interaction using MixABEL. The effect of SNP rs10826334 (near SLC16A9) on SBP was significantly modulated by both the number of alcoholic drinks and the ounces of alcohol consumed per week (p-values of 1.27E-08 and 3.92E-08, respectively). Each copy of the G-allele decreased SBP by 3.79 mmHg in those consuming 14 drinks per week vs. a 0.461 mmHg decrease in non-drinkers. Index SNPs in 20 other loci exhibited suggestive (p-value ≤ 1E-06) associations with BP traits by the 1 df interaction test or joint 2 df test, including 3 rare variants, one low-frequency variant, and SNPs near/in genes ESRRG, FAM179A, CRIPT-SOCS5, KAT2B, ADCY2, GLI3, ZNF716, SLIT1, PDE3A, KERA-LUM, RNF219-AS1, CLEC3A, FBXO15, and IGSF5. SNP-alcohol interactions may enhance discovery of novel variants with large effects that can be targeted with lifestyle modifications.",1
24374933,"Mutations in the TP53 tumour suppressor gene occur in half of all human cancers, indicating its critical importance in inhibiting cancer development. Despite extensive studies, the mechanisms by which mutant p53 enhances tumour progression remain only partially understood. Here, using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), genomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed on 2256 tumours from 10 human cancer types. We show that tumours with TP53 mutations have altered gene expression profiles compared to tumours retaining two wild-type TP53 alleles. Among 113 known p53-up-regulated target genes identified from cell culture assays, 10 were consistently up-regulated in at least eight of 10 cancer types that retain both copies of wild-type TP53. RPS27L, CDKN1A (p21(CIP1)) and ZMAT3 were significantly up-regulated in all 10 cancer types retaining wild-type TP53. Using this p53-based expression analysis as a discovery tool, we used cell-based assays to identify five novel p53 target genes from genes consistently up-regulated in wild-type p53 cancers. Global gene expression analyses revealed that cell cycle regulatory genes and transcription factors E2F1, MYBL2 and FOXM1 were disproportionately up-regulated in many TP53 mutant cancer types. Finally, > 93% of tumours with a TP53 mutation exhibited greatly reduced wild-type p53 messenger expression, due to loss of heterozygosity or copy neutral loss of heterozygosity, supporting the concept of p53 as a recessive tumour suppressor. The data indicate that tumours with wild-type TP53 retain some aspects of p53-mediated growth inhibitory signalling through activation of p53 target genes and suppression of cell cycle regulatory genes.",1
24369323,"Imatinib resistance is the most important clinical issue in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). However, the association of imatinib resistance with the genetic characteristics of GIST has not been clearly defined. Our meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between imatinib resistance and KIT and PDGFRA mutations in GIST. METHODS. We identified all relevant studies in PubMed and Embase. The effect sizes were calculated as prevalence or odds ratio (OR) with a random-effects model. RESULTS. We identified 10 eligible studies that included 1083 GIST cases. Total imatinib resistance was found in 35.5 % of PDGFRA-mutant tumors (OR = 2.9, P = 0.038), 33.7% of wild-type tumors (KIT and PDGFRA non-mutant tumors; OR = 2.8, P = 0.002), and 27.4% of KIT-mutant tumors (OR = 0.3, P = 0.001). Primary imatinib resistance was found in 50.0% of PDGFRA-mutant tumors (OR = 10.9, P = 0.031), 33.4% of wild-type tumors (OR = 5.9, P = 0.060), and 8.9% of KIT-mutant tumors (OR = 0.2, P = 0.025). KIT exon 9-mutant tumors showed primary resistance more frequently than exon 11-mutant and other tumors (OR = 7.6, P < 0.001). Regarding secondary resistance associated with KIT second-site mutations, the exon 17 mutation (54.5%) was most frequent, followed by exon 13 (38.3%) and 14 (13.4%) mutations. CONCLUSION. Our meta-analysis indicates that imatinib resistance is closely associated with KIT and PDGFRA genotypes in GIST. Thus, the mutational status of KIT and PDGFRA might predict response to imatinib in GIST patients.",1
24367375,"Cancer arises through accumulation of epigenetic and genetic alteration. Aberrant promoter methylation is a common epigenetic mechanism of gene silencing in cancer cells. We here performed genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation of promoter regions by Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip, using 14 clinical papillary thyroid cancer samples and 10 normal thyroid samples. Among the 14 papillary cancer cases, 11 showed frequent aberrant methylation, but the other three cases showed no aberrant methylation at all. Distribution of the hypermethylation among cancer samples was non-random, which implied existence of a subset of preferentially methylated papillary thyroid cancer. Among 25 frequently methylated genes, methylation status of six genes (HIST1H3J, POU4F2, SHOX2, PHKG2, TLX3, HOXA7) was validated quantitatively by pyrosequencing. Epigenetic silencing of these genes in methylated papillary thyroid cancer cell lines was confirmed by gene re-expression following treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A, and detected by real-time RT-PCR. Methylation of these six genes was validated by analysis of additional 20 papillary thyroid cancer and 10 normal samples. Among the 34 cancer samples in total, 26 cancer samples with preferential methylation were significantly associated with mutation of BRAF/RAS oncogene (P = 0.04, Fisher's exact test). Thus, we identified new genes with frequent epigenetic hypermethylation in papillary thyroid cancer, two subsets of either preferentially methylated or hardly methylated papillary thyroid cancer, with a concomitant occurrence of oncogene mutation and gene methylation. These hypermethylated genes may constitute potential biomarkers for papillary thyroid cancer.",1
24357727,"Thrombin, the major enzyme of the hemostatic system, is involved in biological processes associated with several human diseases. The capacity of a given individual to generate thrombin, called the thrombin generation potential (TGP), can be robustly measured in plasma and was shown to associate with thrombotic disorders. To investigate the genetic architecture underlying the interindividual TGP variability, we conducted a genome-wide association study in 2 discovery samples (N = 1967) phenotyped for 3 TGP biomarkers, the endogenous thrombin potential, the peak height, and the lag time, and replicated the main findings in 2 independent studies (N = 1254). We identified the ORM1 gene, coding for orosomucoid, as a novel locus associated with lag time variability, reflecting the initiation process of thrombin generation with a combined P value of P = 7.1 × 10(-15) for the lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs150611042). This SNP was also observed to associate with ORM1 expression in monocytes (P = 8.7 × 10(-10)) and macrophages (P = 3.2 × 10(-3)). In vitro functional experiments further demonstrated that supplementing normal plasma with increasing orosomucoid concentrations was associated with impaired thrombin generation. These results pave the way for novel mechanistic pathways and therapeutic perspectives in the etiology of thrombin-related disorders.",1
24357125,"Interstitial deletions of chromosome band 14q24.1q24.3 are apparently very rare. We report on three unrelated patients with overlapping de novo deletions of sizes 5.4, 2.8, and 2.3 Mb in this region. While some clinical problems such as intestinal malrotation, cryptorchidism, and ectopic kidney were only observed in single patients, all three patients had mild intellectual disability, congenital heart defects (truncus arteriosus, pulmonary atresia, atrial septal defect, and/or ventricular septal defect), brachydactyly, hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, and thin upper lips. Likely haploinsufficiency of one or several of the 19 genes in the common deleted interval (ACTN1, DCAF5, EXD2, GALNTL1, ERH, SLC39A9, PLEKHD1, CCDC177, KIAA0247, LOC100289511, SRSF5, SLC10A1, SMOC1, SLC8A3, ADAM21P1, COX16, SYNJ2BP, SYNJ2BP-COX16, ADAM21) was responsible for these manifestations, but apart from SMOC1, mutations in which cause autosomal recessive Waardenburg anophthalmia syndrome, and ACTN1, mutations in which are associated with congenital macrothrombocytopenia, no disease associations have so far been reported for the other genes. Functional studies and a systematic search for mutations or chromosome aberrations in this region will elucidate the role of individual genes in the clinical manifestations and will provide insight into the underlying biological mechanisms.",1
24346875,"Verrucous epidermal nevi are congenital hamartomas composed of keratinocytes and may occur alone or in association with developmental abnormalities. A close relationship between variations in the PIK3CA and FGFR3 genes and the appearance of nevi has been recently reported. Based on that, we performed molecular assays for the identification of E542K, E545G/K and H1047R mutations in the PIK3CA gene and of the R248C mutation in the FGFR3 gene. Interestingly, during the amplification process, we did not observe the PCR product of exon 9 of the PIK3CA gene, a region comprising amino acids 542-545. This strongly suggests the occurrence of a microdeletion of that region and indicates a possible allelic variant, which has not yet being described in the literature.",1
24336208,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several risk variants for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). These common variants have replicable but small effects on LOAD risk and generally do not have obvious functional effects. Low-frequency coding variants, not detected by GWAS, are predicted to include functional variants with larger effects on risk. To identify low-frequency coding variants with large effects on LOAD risk, we carried out whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 14 large LOAD families and follow-up analyses of the candidate variants in several large LOAD case-control data sets. A rare variant in PLD3 (phospholipase D3; Val232Met) segregated with disease status in two independent families and doubled risk for Alzheimer's disease in seven independent case-control series with a total of more than 11,000 cases and controls of European descent. Gene-based burden analyses in 4,387 cases and controls of European descent and 302 African American cases and controls, with complete sequence data for PLD3, reveal that several variants in this gene increase risk for Alzheimer's disease in both populations. PLD3 is highly expressed in brain regions that are vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease pathology, including hippocampus and cortex, and is expressed at significantly lower levels in neurons from Alzheimer's disease brains compared to control brains. Overexpression of PLD3 leads to a significant decrease in intracellular amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and extracellular Aβ42 and Aβ40 (the 42- and 40-residue isoforms of the amyloid-β peptide), and knockdown of PLD3 leads to a significant increase in extracellular Aβ42 and Aβ40. Together, our genetic and functional data indicate that carriers of PLD3 coding variants have a twofold increased risk for LOAD and that PLD3 influences APP processing. This study provides an example of how densely affected families may help to identify rare variants with large effects on risk for disease or other complex traits.",1
24325915,"Triple-negative (TN) breast cancer is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer associated with a unique set of epidemiologic and genetic risk factors. We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study of TN breast cancer (stage 1: 1529 TN cases, 3399 controls; stage 2: 2148 cases, 1309 controls) to identify loci that influence TN breast cancer risk. Variants in the 19p13.1 and PTHLH loci showed genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 × 10(-) (8)) in stage 1 and 2 combined. Results also suggested a substantial enrichment of significantly associated variants among the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analyzed in stage 2. Variants from 25 of 74 known breast cancer susceptibility loci were also associated with risk of TN breast cancer (P < 0.05). Associations with TN breast cancer were confirmed for 10 loci (LGR6, MDM4, CASP8, 2q35, 2p24.1, TERT-rs10069690, ESR1, TOX3, 19p13.1, RALY), and we identified associations with TN breast cancer for 15 additional breast cancer loci (P < 0.05: PEX14, 2q24.1, 2q31.1, ADAM29, EBF1, TCF7L2, 11q13.1, 11q24.3, 12p13.1, PTHLH, NTN4, 12q24, BRCA2, RAD51L1-rs2588809, MKL1). Further, two SNPs independent of previously reported signals in ESR1 [rs12525163 odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, P = 4.9 × 10(-) (4)] and 19p13.1 (rs1864112 OR = 0.84, P = 1.8 × 10(-) (9)) were associated with TN breast cancer. A polygenic risk score (PRS) for TN breast cancer based on known breast cancer risk variants showed a 4-fold difference in risk between the highest and lowest PRS quintiles (OR = 4.03, 95% confidence interval 3.46-4.70, P = 4.8 × 10(-) (69)). This translates to an absolute risk for TN breast cancer ranging from 0.8% to 3.4%, suggesting that genetic variation may be used for TN breast cancer risk prediction.",1
24320567,"The complete mitochondrial genome of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria pseudobassiana (Ascomycota, Cordycipitaceae) was determined and found to be 28,006 bp in length. It encodes genes for 14 proteins, 2 ribosomal RNA subunits, 25 transfer RNAs with the synteny identical to those of B. bassiana and B. brongniartii. The overall base composition is 36.7% A, 35.8% T, 15.3% C and 12.2% G with an AT content of 72.5%. Group-І introns were found in large rRNA gene (rnl) and cox2 gene that include rps3 gene and putative GIY-YIG homing endonuclease, respectively. The mitochondrial genome of B. pseudobassiana will contribute to the investigation of the phylogenetic relationship, taxonomic resolution and biogeography of Beauveria.",1
24314385,"Facial contact dermatitis is frequently encountered in medical practice in both male and female patients. Identifying the underlying cause can be challenging, and the causative agent may be overlooked if it is not considered during the assessment of a patient. The two main types of contact dermatitis are irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) and allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). The mechanisms and common causative agents vary for both ICD and ACD, but the clinical picture is often similar, particularly for chronic disease. Facial contact dermatitis can be successfully treated by avoiding the causative agent. In this review, we focus on the clinical assessment of a patient with facial contact dermatitis and the mechanisms of both ICD and ACD. Common causative agents, including emerging allergens, are discussed in detail, and suggestions are made regarding the management of patients with proven ICD or ACD of the face.",1
24292195,"Gingivo-buccal oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC-GB), an anatomical and clinical subtype of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), is prevalent in regions where tobacco-chewing is common. Exome sequencing (n=50) and recurrence testing (n=60) reveals that some significantly and frequently altered genes are specific to OSCC-GB (USP9X, MLL4, ARID2, UNC13C and TRPM3), while some others are shared with HNSCC (for example, TP53, FAT1, CASP8, HRAS and NOTCH1). We also find new genes with recurrent amplifications (for example, DROSHA, YAP1) or homozygous deletions (for example, DDX3X) in OSCC-GB. We find a high proportion of C>G transversions among tobacco users with high numbers of mutations. Many pathways that are enriched for genomic alterations are specific to OSCC-GB. Our work reveals molecular subtypes with distinctive mutational profiles such as patients predominantly harbouring mutations in CASP8 with or without mutations in FAT1. Mean duration of disease-free survival is significantly elevated in some molecular subgroups. These findings open new avenues for biological characterization and exploration of therapies.",1

24256495,"Accompanying the high rates of vitamin D deficiency observed in many countries, there is increasing interest in the physiological functions of vitamin D. Vitamin D is recognized to exert extra-skeletal actions in addition to its classic roles in bone and mineral homeostasis. Here, we review the evidence for vitamin D's actions in muscle on the basis of observational studies, clinical trials and basic research. Numerous observational studies link vitamin D deficiency with muscle weakness and sarcopaenia. Randomized trials predominantly support an effect of vitamin D supplementation and the prevention of falls in older or institutionalized patients. Studies have also examined the effect of vitamin D in athletic performance, both inferentially by UV radiation and directly by vitamin D supplementation. Effects of vitamin D in muscle metabolic function, specifically insulin sensitivity, are also addressed in this review. At a mechanistic level, animal studies have evaluated the roles of vitamin D and associated minerals, calcium and phosphate, in muscle function. In vitro studies have identified molecular pathways by which vitamin D regulates muscle cell signalling and gene expression. This review evaluates evidence for the various roles of vitamin D in skeletal muscle and discusses controversies that have made this a dynamic field of research.",0
24252657,"Cholesterol is essential for the growth and function of all mammalian cells, but abnormally increased blood cholesterol is a major risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters G5 (ABCG5) and G8 (ABCG8) form an obligate heterodimer that limits intestinal absorption and facilitates biliary secretion of cholesterol and phytosterols. Consistent with their function, ABCG5 and ABCG8 are located on the apical membrane of enterocytes and hepatocytes. Liver X receptor is the major positive regulator of ABCG5 and ABCG8 expression. Mutations in either of the two genes cause sitosterolemia, a condition in which cholesterol and plant sterols accumulate in the circulation leading to premature cardiovascular disease. Overexpression of ABCG5 and ABCG8 in mice retards diet-induced atherosclerosis because of reduced circulating and hepatic cholesterol. In the current review, we summarize recent developments and propose a future framework that provides new perspectives on the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",1
24199959,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly individuals, resulting from a complex interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Impaired brain iron homeostasis has been recognized as an important mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of this disease. Nevertheless, the knowledge gathered so far at the systemic level is clearly insufficient. Herein, we used an integrative approach to study iron metabolism in the periphery, at both genotypic and phenotypic levels, in a sample of 116 patients with AD and 89 healthy control subjects. To assess the potential impact of iron metabolism on the risk of developing AD, genetic analyses were performed along with the evaluation of the iron status profile in peripheral blood by biochemical and gene expression studies. The results obtained showed a significant decrease of serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin concentrations in patients compared with the control subjects. Also, a significant decrease of ferroportin (SLC40A1) and both transferrin receptors TFRC and TFR2 transcripts was found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients. At the genetic level, significant associations with AD were found for single nucleotide polymorphisms in TF, TFR2, ACO1, and SLC40A1 genes. Apolipoprotein E gene, a well-known risk factor for AD, was also found significantly associated with the disease in this study. Taken together, we hypothesize that the alterations on systemic iron status observed in patients could reflect an iron homeostasis dysregulation, particularly in cellular iron efflux. The intracellular iron accumulation would lead to a rise in oxidative damage, contributing to AD pathophysiology.",1
24194096,"Identifying gene neighbourhoods using either distance- or probability-based measures has proven effective in retrieving co-functional links.

We demonstrate that integrating these measures improves prediction of both pathways and phenotypes.",0
24182552,"Activation of inflammatory pathways measured by serum inflammatory markers such as interleukin-18 (IL-18) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) is strongly associated with the progression of chronic disease states in older adults. Given that these serum cytokine levels are in part a heritable trait, genetic variation may predict increased serum levels. Using the Cardiovascular Health Study and InCHIANTI cohorts, a genome-wide association study was performed to identify genetic variants that influence IL-18 and IL-1ra serum levels among older adults. Multiple linear regression models characterized the association between each SNP and log-transformed cytokine values. Tests for multiple independent signals within statistically significant loci were performed using haplotype analysis and regression models conditional on lead SNP in each region. Multiple SNPs were associated with these cytokines with genome-wide significance, including SNPs in the IL-18-BCO gene region of chromosome 2 for IL-18 (top SNP rs2250417, P=1.9×10(-32)) and in the IL-1 gene family region of chromosome 2 for IL-1ra (rs6743376, P=2.3×10(-26)). Haplotype tests and conditional linear regression models showed evidence of multiple independent signals in these regions. Serum IL-18 levels were also associated with a region on chromosome 2 containing the NLRC4 gene (rs12989936, P=2.7×10(-19)). These data characterize multiple robust genetic signals that influence IL-18 and IL-1ra cytokine production. In particular, the signal for serum IL-18 located on chromosome two is novel and potentially important in inflammasome triggered chronic activation of inflammation in older adults. Replication in independent cohorts is an important next step, as well as molecular studies to better understand the role of NLRC4.",1
24173087,"In Ph- myeloproliferative neoplasms, the quantification of the JAK2V617F transcripts may provide some advantages over the DNA allele burden determination. We developed a q-RT-PCR to assess the JAK2WT and JAK2V617F mRNA expression in 105 cases (23 donors, 13 secondary polycythemia, 22 polycythemia vera (PV), 38 essential thrombocythemia (ET), and 9 primary myelofibrosis (PMF)). Compared with the standard allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO)-PCR technique, our assay showed a 100 % concordance rate detecting the JAK2V617F mutation in 22/22 PV (100 %), 29/38 (76.3 %) ET, and 5/9 (55.5 %) PMF cases, respectively. The sensitivity of the assay was 0.01 %. Comparing DNA and RNA samples, we found that the JAK2V617F mutational ratios were significantly higher at the RNA level both in PV (p = 0.005) and ET (p = 0.001) samples. In PV patients, JAK2WT expression levels positively correlated with the platelets (PLTs) (p = 0.003) whereas a trend to negative correlation was observed with the Hb levels (p = 0.051). JAK2V617F-positive cases showed the lowest JAK2WT and ABL1 mRNA expression levels. In all the samples, the expression pattern of beta-glucoronidase (GUSB) was more homogeneous than that of ABL1 or β2 microglobulin (B2M). Using GUSB as normalizator gene, a significant increase of the JAK2V617F mRNA levels was seen in two ET patients at time of progression to PV. In conclusion, the proposed q-RT-PCR is a sensitive and accurate method to quantify the JAK2 mutational status that can also show clinical correlations suggesting the impact of the residual amount of the JAK2WT allele on the Ph- MPN disease phenotype. Our observations also preclude the use of ABL1 as a housekeeping gene for these neoplasms.",1
24169648,"Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) is widely known to be dioecious. However, monoecious plants can also occur in this species. Sex expression in dioecious spinach plants is controlled by a single gene pair termed X and Y. Our previous study showed that a single, incompletely dominant gene, which controls the monoecious condition in spinach line 03-336, should be allelic or linked to X/Y. Here, we developed 19 AFLP markers closely linked to the monoecious gene. The AFLP markers were mapped to a 38.2-cM chromosomal region that included the monoecious gene, which is bracketed between flanking markers with a distance of 7.1 cM. The four AFLP markers developed in our studies were converted into sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers, which are linked to both the monoecious gene and Y and are common to both populations segregating for the genes. Linkage analysis using the SCAR markers suggested that the monoecious gene (M) and Y are located in different intervals, between different marker pairs. Analysis of populations segregating for both M and Y also directly demonstrates linkage of the genes at a distance of ~12 cM. The data presented in this study may be useful for breeding dioecious and highly male monoecious lines utilized as the pollen parents for hybrid seed production, as well as for studies of the evolutionary history of sexual systems in this species, and can provide a molecular basis for positional cloning of the sex-determining genes.",0
24151074,"Satellite cell self-renewal is an essential process to maintaining the robustness of skeletal muscle regenerative capacity. However, extrinsic factors that regulate self-renewal of satellite cells are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that TWEAK cytokine reduces the proportion of Pax7(+)/MyoD(-) cells (an index of self-renewal) on myofiber explants and represses multiple components of Notch signaling in satellite cell cultures. The number of Pax7(+) cells is significantly increased in skeletal muscle of TWEAK knock-out (KO) mice compared with wild-type in response to injury. Furthermore, Notch signaling is significantly elevated in cultured satellite cells and in regenerating myofibers of TWEAK-KO mice. Forced activation of Notch signaling through overexpression of the Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) rescued the TWEAK-mediated inhibition of satellite cell self-renewal. TWEAK also activates the NF-κB transcription factor in satellite cells and inhibition of NF-κB significantly improved the number of Pax7(+) cells in TWEAK-treated cultures. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that a reciprocal interaction between NF-κB and Notch signaling governs the inhibitory effect of TWEAK on satellite cell self-renewal. Collectively, our study demonstrates that TWEAK suppresses satellite cell self-renewal through activating NF-κB and repressing Notch signaling.",1
24148292,"Does evolution proceed faster in larger or smaller populations? The relationship between effective population size (Ne) and the rate of evolution has consequences for our ability to understand and interpret genomic variation, and is central to many aspects of evolution and ecology. Many factors affect the relationship between Ne and the rate of evolution, and recent theoretical and empirical studies have shown some surprising and sometimes counterintuitive results. Some mechanisms tend to make the relationship positive, others negative, and they can act simultaneously. The relationship also depends on whether one is interested in the rate of neutral, adaptive, or deleterious evolution. Here, we synthesize theoretical and empirical approaches to understanding the relationship and highlight areas that remain poorly understood.",0
24137342,"Frequent somatic mutations in the <i>GNA11</i>, matrix metalloproteinase (<i>MMP)27</i>, <i>FGD1, TRRAP</i> and <i>GRM3</i> genes have been reported in various types of human cancer, but whether these genes are mutated in thyroid cancer is not known. In the present study, a mutational analysis of these genes was performed in thyroid cancer cell lines and thyroid cancer samples. No <i>GNA11</i> mutations were identified in the papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) samples. Additionally, no mutations were identified in the <i>MMP27</i> gene, although three synonymous [C351T (N117N), C1089T (S363S) and G1227A (G409G)] single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed infrequently in ATC. No mutations were detected in the <i>FGD1</i> gene, but two infrequent synonymous [T2091C (T697T) and A2136G (P712P)] SNPs were observed in PTC. Furthermore, no mutations were identified in <i>TRRAP</i> and <i>GRM3</i>, although a frequent synonymous SNP [G1323A (T441T)] and infrequent non-synonymous SNP [G1424A (G475D)] of <i>GRM3</i> were observed in PTC. No mutation of these genes was observed in 12 cell lines derived from various types of thyroid cancer. The present study reports for the first time the mutational status of the <i>GNA11, MMP27, FGD1, TRRAP</i> and <i>GRM3</i> genes in thyroid cancer. No mutations were identified in these genes in the various types and cell lines of thyroid cancer. Therefore, unlike in other types of cancer, mutations in these genes are absent or uncommon in thyroid cancer.",1
24134901,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disorder characterized by progressive obliteration of small pulmonary arteries that leads to elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and right heart failure. During the last decades, an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease has resulted in the development of effective therapies targeting endothelial dysfunction (epoprostenol and derivatives, endothelin receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors). These drugs allow clinical, functional and hemodynamic improvement. Even though, no cure exists for PAH and prognosis remains poor. Recently, several additional pathways have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of PAH, and may represent innovative therapies. In this summary, we review conventional therapy, pharmacological agents currently available for the treatment of PAH and the benefit/risk ratio of potential future therapies.",1
24130455,"Over the past three decades, mortality from lung cancer has sharply and continuously increased in China, ascending to the first cause of death among all types of cancer. The ability to identify the actual sequence of gene mutations may help doctors determine which mutations lead to precancerous lesions and which produce invasive carcinomas, especially using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. In this study, we analyzed the latest lung cancer data in the COSMIC database, in order to find genomic ""hotspots"" that are frequently mutated in human lung cancer genomes. The results revealed that the most frequently mutated lung cancer genes are EGFR, KRAS and TP53. In recent years, EGFR and KRAS lung cancer test kits have been utilized for detecting lung cancer patients, but they presented many disadvantages, as they proved to be of low sensitivity, labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this study, we constructed a more complete catalogue of lung cancer mutation events including 145 mutated genes. With the genes of this list it may be feasible to develop a NGS kit for lung cancer mutation detection.",1
24124408,"Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined by a 20-mm Hg difference of systolic blood pressure (dtSBP) and/or a 10-mm Hg difference of diastolic blood pressure (dtDBP) between supine and standing, and OH is associated with a failure of the cardiovascular reflex to maintain blood pressure on standing from a supine position. To understand the underlying genetic factors for OH traits (OH, dtSBP, and dtDBP), genome-wide association studies (GWASs) using 333,651 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were conducted separately for two population-based cohorts, Ansung (n = 3,173) and Ansan (n = 3,255). We identified 8 SNPs (5 SNPs for dtSBP and 3 SNPs for dtDBP) that were repeatedly associated in both the Ansung and Ansan cohorts and had p-values of <1 × 10(-5) in the meta-analysis. Unfortunately, the SNPs of the OH case control GWAS did not pass our p-value criteria. Four of 8 SNPs were located in the intergenic region of chromosome 2, and the nearest gene (CTNNA2) was located at 1 Mb of distance. CTNNA2 is a linker between cadherin adhesion receptors and the actin cytoskeleton and is essential for stabilizing dendritic spines in rodent hippocampal neurons. Although there is no report about the function in blood pressure regulation, hippocampal neurons interact primarily with the autonomic nervous system and might be related to OH. The remaining SNPs, rs7098785 of dtSBP trait and rs6892553, rs16887217, and rs4959677 of dtDBP trait were located in the PIK3AP1 intron, ACTBL2-3' flanking, STAR intron, and intergenic region, respectively, but there was no clear functional link to blood pressure regulation.",1

24122284,"With current advances in genomics, several technological processes have been generated, resulting in improvement in different segments of molecular research involving prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. A widely used contribution is the identification of new genes and their functions, which has led to the elucidation of several issues concerning cell regulation and interactions. For this, increase in the knowledge generated from the identification of promoters becomes considerably relevant, especially considering that to generate new technological processes, such as genetically modified organisms, the availability of promoters that regulate the expression of new genes is still limited. Considering that this issue is essential for biotechnologists, this paper presents an updated review of promoters, from their structure to expression, and focuses on the knowledge already available in eukaryotic systems. Information on current promoters and methodologies available for studying their expression are also reported.",0
24121792,"Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, with transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) being the predominant form. Here we report a genomic analysis of TCC by both whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing of 99 individuals with TCC. Beyond confirming recurrent mutations in genes previously identified as being mutated in TCC, we identified additional altered genes and pathways that were implicated in TCC. Notably, we discovered frequent alterations in STAG2 and ESPL1, two genes involved in the sister chromatid cohesion and segregation (SCCS) process. Furthermore, we also detected a recurrent fusion involving FGFR3 and TACC3, another component of SCCS, by transcriptome sequencing of 42 DNA-sequenced tumors. Overall, 32 of the 99 tumors (32%) harbored genetic alterations in the SCCS process. Our analysis provides evidence that genetic alterations affecting the SCCS process may be involved in bladder tumorigenesis and identifies a new therapeutic possibility for bladder cancer.",1
24121791,"Urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) is heterogeneous at the clinical, pathological and genetic levels. Tumor invasiveness (T) and grade (G) are the main factors associated with outcome and determine patient management. A discovery exome sequencing screen (n = 17), followed by a prevalence screen (n = 60), identified new genes mutated in this tumor coding for proteins involved in chromatin modification (MLL2, ASXL2 and BPTF), cell division (STAG2, SMC1A and SMC1B) and DNA repair (ATM, ERCC2 and FANCA). STAG2, a subunit of cohesin, was significantly and commonly mutated or lost in UBC, mainly in tumors of low stage or grade, and its loss was associated with improved outcome. Loss of expression was often observed in chromosomally stable tumors, and STAG2 knockdown in bladder cancer cells did not increase aneuploidy. STAG2 reintroduction in non-expressing cells led to reduced colony formation. Our findings indicate that STAG2 is a new UBC tumor suppressor acting through mechanisms that are different from its role in preventing aneuploidy.",1
24098343,"Many GWAS have identified novel loci associated with common diseases, but have focused only on main effects of individual genetic variants rather than interactions with environmental factors (GxE). Identification of GxE interactions is particularly important for coronary heart disease (CHD), a major preventable source of morbidity and mortality with strong non-genetic risk factors. Atherosclerosis is the major cause of CHD, and coronary artery calcification (CAC) is directly correlated with quantity of coronary atherosclerotic plaque. In the current study, we tested for genetic variants influencing extent of CAC via interaction with smoking (GxS), by conducting a GxS discovery GWAS in Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) sibships (N = 915 European Americans) followed by replication in Framingham Heart Study (FHS) sibships (N = 1025 European Americans). Generalized estimating equations accounted for the correlation within sibships in strata-specific groups of smokers and nonsmokers, as well as GxS interaction. Primary analysis found SNPs that showed suggestive associations (p≤10(-5)) in GENOA GWAS, but these index SNPs did not replicate in FHS. However, secondary analysis was able to replicate candidate gene regions in FHS using other SNPs (+/-250 kb of GENOA index SNP). In smoker and nonsmoker groups, replicated genes included TCF7L2 (p = 6.0×10(-5)) and WWOX (p = 4.5×10(-6)); and TNFRSF8 (p = 7.8×10(-5)), respectively. For GxS interactions, replicated genes included TBC1D4 (p = 6.9×10(-5)) and ADAMTS9 (P = 7.1×10(-5)). Interestingly, these genes are involved in inflammatory pathways mediated by the NF-κB axis. Since smoking is known to induce chronic and systemic inflammation, association of these genes likely reflects roles in CAC development via inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, the NF-κB axis regulates bone remodeling, a key physiological process in CAC development. In conclusion, GxS GWAS has yielded evidence for novel loci that are associated with CAC via interaction with smoking, providing promising new targets for future population-based and functional studies of CAC development.",1
24091396,"An effective knowledge extraction and quantification methodology from biomedical literature would allow the researcher to organize and analyze the results of high-throughput experiments on microarrays and next-generation sequencing technologies. Despite the large amount of raw information available on the web, a tool able to extract a measure of the correlation between a list of genes and biological processes is not yet available. In this paper, we present Gelsius, a workflow that incorporates biomedical literature to quantify the correlation between genes and terms describing biological processes. To achieve this target, we build different modules focusing on query expansion and document cononicalization. In this way, we reached to improve the measurement of correlation, performed using a latent semantic analysis approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete tool able to extract a measure of genes-biological processes correlation from literature. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed workflow on six biological processes and a set of genes, by showing that correlation results for known relationships are in accordance with definitions of gene functions provided by NCI Thesaurus. On the other side, the tool is able to propose new candidate relationships for later experimental validation. The tool is available at >http://bioeda1.polito.it:8080/medSearchServlet/.",0
24084778,"Nearly 10% of the genes in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster are in nested structures, in which one gene is completely nested within the intron of another gene (nested and including gene, respectively). Even though the coding sequences and untranslated regions of these nested/including gene pairs do not overlap, their intimate structures and the possibility of shared regulatory sequences raise questions about the evolutionary forces governing the origination and subsequent functional and evolutionary impacts of these structures. In this study, we show that nested genes experience weaker evolutionary constraint, have faster rates of protein evolution, and are expressed in fewer tissues than other genes, while including genes show the opposite patterns. Surprisingly, despite completely overlapping with each other, nested and including genes are less likely to display correlated gene expression and biological function than the nearby yet nonoverlapping genes. Interestingly, significantly fewer nested genes are transcribed from the same strand as the including gene. We found that same-strand nested genes are more likely to be single-exon genes. In addition, same-strand including genes are less likely to have known lethal or sterile phenotypes than opposite-strand including genes only when the corresponding nested genes have introns. These results support our hypothesis that selection against potential erroneous mRNA splicing when nested and including genes are on the same strand plays an important role in the evolution of nested gene structures.",0
24080187,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and debilitating mental disorder with a particularly high burden for women. Emerging evidence suggests PTSD may be more heritable among women and evidence from animal models and human correlational studies suggest connections between sex-linked biology and PTSD vulnerability, which may extend to the disorder's genetic architecture. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PTSD in a primarily African American sample of women from the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study (DNHS) and tested for replication in an independent cohort of primarily European American women from the Nurses Health Study II (NHSII). We genotyped 413 DNHS women - 94 PTSD cases and 319 controls exposed to at least one traumatic event - on the Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChip for >700,000 markers and tested 578 PTSD cases and 1963 controls from NHSII for replication. We performed a network-based analysis integrating data from GWAS-derived independent regions of association and the Reactome database of functional interactions. We found genome-wide significant association for one marker mapping to a novel RNA gene, lincRNA AC068718.1, for which we found suggestive evidence of replication in NHSII. Our network-based analysis indicates that our top GWAS results were enriched for pathways related to telomere maintenance and immune function. Our findings implicate a novel RNA gene, lincRNA AC068718.1, as risk factor for PTSD in women and add to emerging evidence that non-coding RNA genes may play a crucial role in shaping the landscape of gene regulation with putative pathological effects that lead to phenotypic differences.",1
24067137,"We analyzed mutations in four genes (FLT3, KRAS/NRAS and PTPN11) that might disrupt the RAS/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPKinase) signaling pathway, to evaluate their prognostic value in children younger than 16 years old with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Bcp-ALL). The overall survival (OS) was determined with the Kaplan-Meier method. MAPKinase genes were mutated in 25.4% and 20.1% of childhood and infant Bcp-ALL, respectively. Children with hyperdiploidy were more prone to harboring a MAPKinase gene mutation (odds ratio [OR] 3.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-9.49). The mean OS of all cases was 54.0 months. FLT3 and PTPN11 mutations had no impact on OS. K/NRAS mutations were strongly associated with MLL-AFF1 (OR 5.78; 95% CI 1.00-33.24), and conferred poorer OS (p = 0.034) in univariate analysis.",1
24038376,"The functionalization of nanoporous zeolite L crystals with β-cyclodextrin (CD) has been demonstrated. The zeolite surface was first modified with amino groups by using two different aminoalkoxysilanes. Then, 1,4-phenylene diisothiocyanate was reacted with the amino monolayer and used to bind CD heptamine by using its remaining isothiocyanate groups. The use of the different aminoalkoxysilanes, 3-aminopropyl dimethylethoxysilane (APDMES) and 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES), led to drastic differences in uptake and release properties. Thionine was found to be absorbed and released from amino- and CD-functionalized zeolites when APDMES was used, whereas functionalization by APTES led to complete blockage of the zeolite channels. Fluorescence microscopy showed that the CD groups covalently attached to the zeolite crystals could bind adamantyl-modified dyes in a specific and reversible manner. This strategy allowed the specific immobilization of His-tagged proteins by using combined host-guest and His-tag-Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) coordination chemistry. Such multifunctional systems have the potential for encapsulation of drug molecules inside the zeolite pores and non-covalent attachment of other (for example, targeting) ligand molecules on its surface.",1
24025767,"Down's syndrome results from full or partial trisomy of chromosome 21. However, the consequences of the underlying gene-dosage imbalance on adult tissues remain poorly understood. Here we show that in Ts65Dn mice, which are trisomic for 132 genes homologous to genes on human chromosome 21, triplication of Usp16 reduces the self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells and the expansion of mammary epithelial cells, neural progenitors and fibroblasts. In addition, Usp16 is associated with decreased ubiquitination of Cdkn2a and accelerated senescence in Ts65Dn fibroblasts. Usp16 can remove ubiquitin from histone H2A on lysine 119, a critical mark for the maintenance of multiple somatic tissues. Downregulation of Usp16, either by mutation of a single normal Usp16 allele or by short interfering RNAs, largely rescues all of these defects. Furthermore, in human tissues overexpression of USP16 reduces the expansion of normal fibroblasts and postnatal neural progenitors, whereas downregulation of USP16 partially rescues the proliferation defects of Down's syndrome fibroblasts. Taken together, these results suggest that USP16 has an important role in antagonizing the self-renewal and/or senescence pathways in Down's syndrome and could serve as an attractive target to ameliorate some of the associated pathologies.",1
24023788,"Lung function is a heritable trait and serves as an important clinical predictor of morbidity and mortality for pulmonary conditions in adults, however, despite its importance, no studies have focused on uncovering pediatric-specific loci influencing lung function. To identify novel genetic determinants of pediatric lung function, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of four pulmonary function traits, including FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC and FEF25-75% in 1556 children. Further, we carried out gene network analyses for each trait including all SNPs with a P-value of <1.0 × 10(-3) from the individual GWAS. The GWAS identified SNPs with notable trends towards association with the pulmonary function measures, including the previously described INTS12 locus association with FEV1 (pmeta=1.41 × 10(-7)). The gene network analyses identified 34 networks of genes associated with pulmonary function variables in Caucasians. Of those, the glycoprotein gene network reached genome-wide significance for all four variables. P-value range pmeta=6.29 × 10(-4) - 2.80 × 10(-8) on meta-analysis. In this study, we report on specific pathways that are significantly associated with pediatric lung function at genome-wide significance. In addition, we report the first loci associated with lung function in both pediatric Caucasian and African American populations.",1
24023261,"Although numerous genes are known to regulate serum lipid traits, identified variants explain only a small proportion of the expected heritability. We intended to identify further genetic variants associated with lipid phenotypes in a self-contained population of Sorbs in Germany. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) levels in 839 Sorbs. All single-nucleotide polymorphisms with a P value <0.01 were subjected to a meta-analysis, including an independent Swedish cohort (Diabetes Genetics Initiative; n = ∼3,100). Novel association signals with the strongest effects were subjected to replication studies in an additional German cohort (Berlin, n = 2,031). In the initial GWAS in the Sorbs, we identified 14 loci associated with lipid phenotypes reaching P values <10⁻⁵ and confirmed significant effects for 18 previously reported loci. The combined meta-analysis of the three study cohorts (n(HDL) = 6041; n(LDL) = 5,995; n(TG) = 6,087) revealed a novel association for a variant in THOC5 (rs8135828) with serum HDL-C levels (P = 1.78 × 10⁻⁷; Z-score = -5.221). Consistently, the variant was also associated with circulating APOA1 levels in Sorbs. The small interfering RNA-mediated mRNA silencing of THOC5 in HepG2 cells resulted in lower mRNA levels of APOA1, SCARB1, and ABCG8 (all P < 0.05). We propose THOC5 to be a novel gene involved in the regulation of serum HDL-C levels.",1
24021007,"Glyphodes quadrimaculalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) feed on a root tuber of Cynanchum wilfordii (Asclepiadaceae), which is one of the most famous traditional medicines in Korea. The genus Glyphodes includes ∼ 130 species distributed worldwide, so the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) would be helpful for bio-identification, biogeographic studies and multigene-based phylogeny. The 15,255 bp long G. quadrimaculalis genome comprises 37 typical genes and 1 large non-coding region, with the typical arrangement found in Lepidoptera. Of the 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 12 begin with typical start codons found in insect mitochondrial PCGs, but the COI gene starts with atypical CGA. One of the noteworthy features of the genome includes the presence of a 51-bp long non-coding space sequence located between tRNA(Gln) and ND2 that reveals high-sequence homology (71.4%) to the neighboring ND2 gene, indicating the origin of the region by partial duplication of the ND2 gene.",1
23999089,"Most proteins are glycosylated, with glycans being integral structural and functional components of a glycoprotein. In contrast to polypeptides, which are fully encoded by the corresponding gene, glycans result from a dynamic interaction between the environment and a network of hundreds of genes.",0
23990791,"Several infrequent genetic polymorphisms in the SERPINA1 gene are known to substantially reduce concentration of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) in the blood. Since low AAT serum levels fail to protect pulmonary tissue from enzymatic degradation, these polymorphisms also increase the risk for early onset chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The role of more common SERPINA1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in respiratory health remains poorly understood. We present here an agnostic investigation of genetic determinants of circulating AAT levels in a general population sample by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 1392 individuals of the SAPALDIA cohort. Five common SNPs, defined by showing minor allele frequencies (MAFs) >5%, reached genome-wide significance, all located in the SERPINA gene cluster at 14q32.13. The top-ranking genotyped SNP rs4905179 was associated with an estimated effect of β = -0.068 g/L per minor allele (P = 1.20*10(-12)). But denser SERPINA1 locus genotyping in 5569 participants with subsequent stepwise conditional analysis, as well as exon-sequencing in a subsample (N = 410), suggested that AAT serum level is causally determined at this locus by rare (MAF<1%) and low-frequent (MAF 1-5%) variants only, in particular by the well-documented protein inhibitor S and Z (PI S, PI Z) variants. Replication of the association of rs4905179 with AAT serum levels in the Copenhagen City Heart Study (N = 8273) was successful (P<0.0001), as was the replication of its synthetic nature (the effect disappeared after adjusting for PI S and Z, P = 0.57). Extending the analysis to lung function revealed a more complex situation. Only in individuals with severely compromised pulmonary health (N = 397), associations of common SNPs at this locus with lung function were driven by rarer PI S or Z variants. Overall, our meta-analysis of lung function in ever-smokers does not support a functional role of common SNPs in the SERPINA gene cluster in the general population.",1
23982661,": Our aim was to explore the association among ACSM4 and PECI polymorphisms and AIDS progression in 454 HIV-infected patients never treated with antiretroviral drugs (146 long-term nonprogressors, 228 moderate progressors, and 80 rapid progressors). For ACSM4 polymorphisms, rs7137120 AA/AG and rs7961991 CC/CT genotypes had higher odds of having a rapid AIDS progression [odds ratio (OR) = 3.21; 95% of confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.26 to 8.16; P = 0.014 and OR = 3.60; 95% CI = 1.38 to 9.36; P = 0.009, respectively]. Additionally, the ACSM4 haplotype integrated for both rs7961991 A and rs7137120 C alleles had higher odds of having a rapid AIDS progression (OR = 2.85; 95% CI = 1.28 to 6.25; P = 0.010). For PECI polymorphisms, no significant associations were found. In conclusion, ACSM4 polymorphisms might play a significant role in AIDS progression.",1
23974990,"Mutations in fused in sarcoma (FUS) in a subset of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) linked this DNA/RNA-binding protein to neurodegeneration. Most of the mutations disrupt the nuclear localization signal which strongly suggests a loss-of-function pathomechanism, supported by cytoplasmic inclusions. FUS-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions are also found in a subset of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Here, we discuss recent data on the role of alternative splicing in FUS-mediated pathology in the central nervous system. Several groups have shown that FUS binds broadly to many transcripts in the brain and have also identified a plethora of putative splice targets; however, only ABLIM1, BRAF, Ewing sarcoma protein R1 (EWSR1), microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), NgCAM cell adhesion molecule (NRCAM), and netrin G1 (NTNG1) have been identified in at least three of four studies. Gene ontology analysis of all putative targets unanimously suggests a role in axon growth and cytoskeletal organization, consistent with the altered morphology of dendritic spines and axonal growth cones reported upon loss of FUS. Among the axonal targets, MAPT/tau and NTNG1 have been further validated in biochemical studies. The next challenge will be to confirm changes of FUS-mediated alternative splicing in patients and define their precise role in the pathophysiology of ALS and FTLD.",1
23966547,"Differential gene expression is believed to largely explain sexually dichotomous phenotypes. This phenomenon is especially significant in hermaphrodites, in which male and female sexual tissues have identical genotypes. Sex differences in transcription have been linked to molecular evolution: genes with higher expression in male compared with female sexual tissues (i.e., male-biased genes) have been associated with rapid gene divergence in various animals and plants, implying that selective differences exist among the sexual structures. In the present investigation, we examined expressed sequence tags, microarrays, and gene sequence data from the hermaphroditic fungus Neurospora crassa and confirmed selective differences of genes with disparate expression among male versus female sexual structures in this organism. The results held across various genotypes and stages of sexual development. Furthermore, our data showed that N. crassa comprises a rare example of an organism where female-biased genes evolve rapidly; they exhibited faster evolution at the protein level and reduced optimal codon usage compared with male-biased genes, sexually unbiased genes, and vegetative genes. Female-biased genes also had a greater portion of sites that experienced positive selection and showed stronger signals of selective sweeps than male-biased genes, suggesting that the rapid evolution is at least partly driven by adaptive evolution. Distinctive aspects of the reproductive biology of N. crassa which might explain the rapid evolution of female-biased genes are discussed, particularly the propensity for female-female competition during mating, as well as the multifunctional nature of male structures. The present findings open new opportunities to test hypotheses about sex-biased gene expression and molecular evolution.",0
23960188,"DNA repair mechanisms are fundamental for B cell development, which relies on the somatic diversification of the immunoglobulin genes by V(D)J recombination, somatic hypermutation, and class switch recombination. Their failure is postulated to promote genomic instability and malignant transformation in B cells. By performing targeted sequencing of 73 key DNA repair genes in 29 B cell lymphoma samples, somatic and germline mutations were identified in various DNA repair pathways, mainly in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). Mutations in mismatch repair genes (EXO1, MSH2, and MSH6) were associated with microsatellite instability, increased number of somatic insertions/deletions, and altered mutation signatures in tumors. Somatic mutations in nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) genes (DCLRE1C/ARTEMIS, PRKDC/DNA-PKcs, XRCC5/KU80, and XRCC6/KU70) were identified in four DLBCL tumors and cytogenetic analyses revealed that translocations involving the immunoglobulin-heavy chain locus occurred exclusively in NHEJ-mutated samples. The novel mutation targets, CHEK2 and PARP1, were further screened in expanded DLBCL cohorts, and somatic as well as novel and rare germline mutations were identified in 8 and 5% of analyzed tumors, respectively. By correlating defects in a subset of DNA damage response and repair genes with genomic instability events in tumors, we propose that these genes play a role in DLBCL lymphomagenesis.",1
23958962,"We report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for cocaine dependence (CD) in three sets of African- and European-American subjects (AAs and EAs, respectively) to identify pathways, genes and alleles important in CD risk. The discovery GWAS data set (n=5697 subjects) was genotyped using the Illumina OmniQuad microarray (8 90 000 analyzed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)). Additional genotypes were imputed based on the 1000 Genomes reference panel. Top-ranked findings were evaluated by incorporating information from publicly available GWAS data from 4063 subjects. Then, the most significant GWAS SNPs were genotyped in 2549 independent subjects. We observed one genome-wide-significant (GWS) result: rs2629540 at the FAM53B ('family with sequence similarity 53, member B') locus. This was supported in both AAs and EAs; P-value (meta-analysis of all samples)=4.28 × 10(-8). The gene maps to the same chromosomal region as the maximum peak we observed in a previous linkage study. NCOR2 (nuclear receptor corepressor 2) SNP rs150954431 was associated with P=1.19 × 10(-9) in the EA discovery sample. SNP rs2456778, which maps to CDK1 ('cyclin-dependent kinase 1'), was associated with cocaine-induced paranoia in AAs in the discovery sample only (P=4.68 × 10(-8)). This is the first study to identify risk variants for CD using GWAS. Our results implicate novel risk loci and provide insights into potential therapeutic and prevention strategies.",1
23935956,"The red blood cell related traits are highly heritable but their genetics are poorly defined. Only 5-10% of the total observed variance is explained by the genetic loci found to date, suggesting that additional loci should be searched using approaches alternative to large meta analysis. GWAS (Genome Wide Association Study) for red blood cell traits in a founder population cohort from Northern Italy identified a new locus for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) in the TAF3 gene. The association was replicated in two cohorts (rs1887582, P = 4.25E-09). TAF3 encodes a transcription cofactor that participates in core promoter recognition complex, and is involved in zebrafish and mouse erythropoiesis. We show here that TAF3 is required for transcription of the SPTA1 gene, encoding alpha spectrin, one of the proteins that link the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton. Mutations in SPTA1 are responsible for hereditary spherocytosis, a monogenic disorder of MCHC, as well as for the normal MCHC level. Based on our results, we propose that TAF3 is required for normal erythropoiesis in human and that it might have a role in controlling the ratio between hemoglobin (Hb) and cell volume and in the dynamics of RBC maturation in healthy individuals. Finally, TAF3 represents a potential candidate or a modifier gene for disorders of red cell membrane.",1
23933903,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a heterogeneous class, varying in pharmacologic properties, which have different therapeutic impacts on patient profiles, including lipophilicity, tissue-ACE binding, duration of action, half-life, and increased bradykinin availability. Among the ACE inhibitor class, the agent perindopril, in particular, has pleiotropic effects that are not equally shared by other ACE inhibitors, including bradykinin site selectivity and subsequent enhancement of nitric oxide and inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis. Moreover, there is a large amount of evidence to suggest that perindopril therapy may reduce cardiovascular event rates in patients, yet perindopril is rarely prescribed in the United States. Ramipril is another ACE inhibitor with both a favorable clinical profile and impressive outcomes data. Our review compares the pharmacologic and trial data among perindopril, ramipril, and other ACE inhibitors. In patients with or at high risk for coronary heart disease who do not have heart failure, or in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, perindopril should be among the preferred treatment agents in the ACE inhibitor class. Ramipril has an impressive track record of improving cardiovascular outcomes, too, and should be considered a preferred agent among the ACE inhibitor class.",1
23931760,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disorder in industrialized countries. Liver samples from morbidly obese patients (n = 45) with all stages of NAFLD and controls (n = 18) were analyzed by array-based DNA methylation and mRNA expression profiling. NAFLD-specific expression and methylation differences were seen for nine genes coding for key enzymes in intermediate metabolism (including PC, ACLY, and PLCG1) and insulin/insulin-like signaling (including IGF1, IGFBP2, and PRKCE) and replicated by bisulfite pyrosequening (independent n = 39). Transcription factor binding sites at NAFLD-specific CpG sites were >1,000-fold enriched for ZNF274, PGC1A, and SREBP2. Intraindividual comparison of liver biopsies before and after bariatric surgery showed NAFLD-associated methylation changes to be partially reversible. Postbariatric and NAFLD-specific methylation signatures were clearly distinct both in gene ontology and transcription factor binding site analyses, with >400-fold enrichment of NRF1, HSF1, and ESRRA sites. Our findings provide an example of treatment-induced epigenetic organ remodeling in humans.",1
23922791,"Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a very rare soft tissue sarcoma. DFSP often reveals a specific chromosome translocation, t(17;22)(q22;q13), which results in the fusion of collagen 1 alpha 1 (COL1A1) gene and platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB) gene. The COL1A1-PDGFB fusion protein activates the PDGFB receptor and resultant constitutive activation of PDGFR receptor is essential in the pathogenesis of DFSP. Thus, blocking PDGFR receptor activation with imatinib has shown promising activity in the treatment of advanced and metastatic DFSP. Despite the success with targeted agents in cancers, acquired drug resistance eventually occurs. Here, we tried to identify potential drug resistance mechanisms against imatinib in a 46-year old female with DFSP who initially responded well to imatinib but suffered rapid disease progression. We performed whole-genome sequencing of both pre-treatment and post-treatment tumor tissue to identify the mutational events associated with imatinib resistance. No significant copy number alterations, insertion, and deletions were identified during imatinib treatment. Of note, we identified newly emerged 8 non-synonymous somatic mutations of the genes (ACAP2, CARD10, KIAA0556, PAAQR7, PPP1R39, SAFB2, STARD9, and ZFYVE9) in the imatinib-resistant tumor tissue. This study revealed diverse possible candidate mechanisms by which imatinib resistance to PDGFRB inhibition may arise in DFSP, and highlights the usefulness of whole-genome sequencing in identifying drug resistance mechanisms and in pursuing genome-directed, personalized anti-cancer therapy.",1
23918589,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and their subsequent meta-analyses have changed the landscape of genetics in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by uncovering several novel genes. Such studies are heavily weighted by samples from Caucasian populations, but they explain only a small proportion of total heritability. Our previous studies in genetically distinct North Indian RA cohorts have demonstrated apparent allelic/genetic heterogeneity between North Indian and Western populations, warranting GWAS in non-European populations. We undertook this study to detect additional disease-associated loci that may be collectively important in the presence or absence of genes with a major effect.",1
23904343,"Chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and histone proteins form a highly condensed structure known as chromatin. Chromatin remodeling proteins regulate deoxyribonucleic acid transcription, synthesis and repair by changing nucleosomal composition in an adenosine triphosphate-dependent manner and mediate access of deoxyribonucleic acid-binding proteins to deoxyribonucleic acid double strands. Recently, large-scale genome sequencing studies identified somatic mutations in genes encoding chromatin remodeling proteins in a variety of human solid cancers. Notably, inactivating mutations in genes encoding the catalytic and regulatory subunits of the switch/sucrose non-fermenting chromatin remodeling complex have been detected in several solid cancers: sucrose non-fermenting/switch/sucrose non-fermenting-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily b, member 1/Brahma-related gene 1-associated factor 47/integrase interactor 1 mutations in rhabdoid tumors; AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1 A/Brahma-related gene 1-associated factor 250a mutations in ovarian clear cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric adenocarcinoma; polybromo 1/Brahma-related gene 1-associated factor 180 mutations in renal clear cell carcinoma; Brahma-related gene 1/switch/sucrose non-fermenting-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 4 mutations in non-small-cell lung carcinoma and AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 2/Brahma-related gene 1-associated factor 200 mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma and malignant melanoma. This suggests that the switch/sucrose non-fermenting complex has a tumor-suppressive function, and that switch/sucrose non-fermenting gene deficiencies may affect the properties of cancer cells, which could be of value for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",1
23894154,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) have identified associations with polymorphisms at 2q35 (DIRC3), 8p12 (NRG1), 9q22.33 (FOXE1), and 14q13.2 (NKX2-1). However, most of the inherited genetic risk factors of DTC remain to be discovered.",1
23872634,"Brugada syndrome is a rare cardiac arrhythmia disorder, causally related to SCN5A mutations in around 20% of cases. Through a genome-wide association study of 312 individuals with Brugada syndrome and 1,115 controls, we detected 2 significant association signals at the SCN10A locus (rs10428132) and near the HEY2 gene (rs9388451). Independent replication confirmed both signals (meta-analyses: rs10428132, P = 1.0 × 10(-68); rs9388451, P = 5.1 × 10(-17)) and identified one additional signal in SCN5A (at 3p21; rs11708996, P = 1.0 × 10(-14)). The cumulative effect of the three loci on disease susceptibility was unexpectedly large (Ptrend = 6.1 × 10(-81)). The association signals at SCN5A-SCN10A demonstrate that genetic polymorphisms modulating cardiac conduction can also influence susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmia. The implication of association with HEY2, supported by new evidence that Hey2 regulates cardiac electrical activity, shows that Brugada syndrome may originate from altered transcriptional programming during cardiac development. Altogether, our findings indicate that common genetic variation can have a strong impact on the predisposition to rare diseases.",1
23859904,"Fusion genes involved in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) occur mostly due to genetic and environmental factors, and only a limited number of studies have reported any ethnic influence. This study assesses whether an ethnic influence has an effect on the frequency of any of the four fusion genes: BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1, and MLL-AFF1 found in ALL. To study this ethnic influence, mononuclear cells were obtained from bone marrow samples from 143 patients with ALL. We performed RNA extraction and reverse transcription, then assessed the quality of the cDNA by amplifying the ABL1 control gene, and finally evaluated the presence of the four transcripts by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. We found 10 patients who had the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene (7%); 3 patients (2%) were TCF3-PBX1 positive; and 6 patients (4.5%) were ETV6-RUNX1 positive. The incidence of this last fusion gene is quite low when compared to the values reported in most countries. The low incidence of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene found in Guatemala matches the incidence rates that have been reported in Spain and Indian Romani. Since it is known that an ethnic resemblance exists among these three populations, as shown by ancestral marker studies, the ALL data suggests an ethnic influence on the occurrence and frequency of this particular fusion gene.",1
23840832,"Free fatty acids (FFAs), elevated in metabolic syndrome and diabetes, play a crucial role in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) counteracts many aspects of FFA-induced vascular pathology. Although vascular calcification is invariably associated with atherosclerosis, the mechanisms involved are not completely elucidated. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that EPA prevents the osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) induced by palmitic acid (PA), the most abundant long-chain saturated fatty acid in plasma. PA increased and EPA abolished the expression of the genes for bone-related proteins, including bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, Msx2 and osteopontin in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC). Among the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) subfamily, ACSL3 expression was predominant in HASMC, and PA robustly increased and EPA efficiently inhibited ACSL3 expression. Importantly, PA-induced osteoblastic differentiation was mediated, at least in part, by ACSL3 activation because acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) inhibitor or siRNA targeted to ACSL3 completely prevented the PA induction of both BMP-2 and Msx2. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated ACSL3 overexpression enhanced PA-induced BMP-2 and Msx2 expression. In addition, EPA, ACSL3 siRNA and ACS inhibitor attenuated calcium deposition and caspase activation induced by PA. Notably, PA induced activation of NF-κB, and NF-κB inhibitor prevented PA-induction of osteoblastic gene expression and calcium deposition. Immunohistochemistry revealed the prominent expression of ACSL3 in VSMC and macrophages in human non-calcifying and calcifying atherosclerotic plaques from the carotid arteries. These results identify ACSL3 and NF-κB as mediators of PA-induced osteoblastic differentiation and calcium deposition in VSMC and suggest that EPA prevents vascular calcification by inhibiting such a new molecular pathway elicited by PA.",1
23832661,"It is poorly understood how driver mutations in cancer genes work together to promote tumor development. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) offers a unique opportunity to study complex relationships among cancer genes. The four most commonly mutated genes in RCC of clear-cell type (the most common type) are two-hit tumor suppressor genes, and they cluster in a 43-Mb region on chromosome 3p that is deleted in approximately 90% of tumors: VHL (mutated in ∼80%), PBRM1 (∼50%), BAP1 (∼15%), and SETD2 (∼15%). Meta-analyses that we conducted show that mutations in PBRM1 and SETD2 co-occur in tumors at a frequency higher than expected by chance alone, indicating that these mutations may cooperate in tumorigenesis. In contrast, consistent with our previous results, mutations in PBRM1 and BAP1 tend to be mutually exclusive. Mutation exclusivity analyses (often confounded by lack of statistical power) raise the possibility of functional redundancy. However, mutation exclusivity may indicate negative genetic interactions, as proposed herein for PBRM1 and BAP1, and mutations in these genes define RCC with different pathologic features, gene expression profiles, and outcomes. Negative genetic interactions among cancer genes point toward broader context dependencies of cancer gene action beyond tissue dependencies. An enhanced understanding of cancer gene dependencies may help to unravel vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically.",1
23831921,"Interstitial deletion of chromosome 5q is the most common chromosomal abnormality in myelodysplastic syndromes. The catalogue of genes involved in the molecular pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes is rapidly expanding and next-generation sequencing technology allows detection of these mutations at great depth. Here we describe the design, validation and application of a targeted next-generation sequencing approach to simultaneously screen 25 genes mutated in myeloid malignancies. We used this method alongside single nucleotide polymorphism-array technology to characterize the mutational and cytogenetic profile of 43 cases of early or advanced del(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes. A total of 29 mutations were detected in our cohort. Overall, 45% of early and 66.7% of advanced cases had at least one mutation. Genes with the highest mutation frequency among advanced cases were TP53 and ASXL1 (25% of patients each). These showed a lower mutation frequency in cases of 5q- syndrome (4.5% and 13.6%, respectively), suggesting a role in disease progression in del(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes. Fifty-two percent of mutations identified were in genes involved in epigenetic regulation (ASXL1, TET2, DNMT3A and JAK2). Six mutations had allele frequencies <20%, likely below the detection limit of traditional sequencing methods. Genomic array data showed that cases of advanced del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome had a complex background of cytogenetic aberrations, often encompassing genes involved in myeloid disorders. Our study is the first to investigate the molecular pathogenesis of early and advanced del(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes using next-generation sequencing technology on a large panel of genes frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies, further illuminating the molecular landscape of del(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes.",1
23829793,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic and progressive disease leading to right heart failure and ultimately death if untreated. The first classification of PH was proposed in 1973. In 2008, the fourth World Symposium on PH held in Dana Point (California, USA) revised previous classifications. Currently, PH is devided into five subgroups. Group 1 includes patients suffering from idiopathic or familial PAH with or without germline mutations. Patients with a diagnosis of PAH should systematically been screened regarding to underlying mutations of BMPR2 gene (bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2) or more rarely of ACVRL1 (activine receptor-like kinase type 1), ENG (endogline) or Smad8 genes. Pulmonary veno occusive disease and pulmonary capillary hemagiomatosis are individualized and designated as clinical group 1'. Group 2 'Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart diseases' is divided into three sub-groups: systolic dysfonction, diastolic dysfonction and valvular dysfonction. Group 3 'Pulmonary hypertension due to respiratory diseases' includes a heterogenous subgroup of respiratory diseases like PH due to pulmonary fibrosis, COPD, lung emphysema or interstitial lung disease for exemple. Group 4 includes chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension without any distinction of proximal or distal forms. Group 5 regroup PH patients with unclear multifactorial mechanisms. Invasive hemodynamic assessment with right heart catheterization is requested to confirm the definite diagnosis of PH showing a resting mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of ≥ 25 mmHg and a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of ≤ 15 mmHg. The assessment of PCWP may allow the distinction between pre-capillary and post-capillary PH (PCWP > 15 mmHg). Echocardiography is an important tool in the management of patients with underlying suspicion of PH. The European Society of Cardiology and the European Respiratory Society (ESC-ERS) guidelines specify its role, essentially in the screening proposing criteria for estimating the presence of PH mainly based on tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity and systolic artery pressure (sPAP). The therapy of PAH consists of non-specific drugs including oral anticoagulation and diuretics as well as PAH specific therapy. Diuretics are one of the most important treatment in the setting of PH because right heart failure leads to fluid retention, hepatic congestion, ascites and peripheral edema. Current recommendations propose oral anticoagulation aiming for targeting an International Normalized Ratio (INR) between 1.5-2.5. Target INR for patients displaying chronic thromboembolic PH is between 2-3. Better understanding in pathophysiological mechanisms of PH over the past quarter of a century has led to the development of medical therapeutics, even though no cure for PAH exists. Several specific therapeutic agents were developed for the medical management of PAH including prostanoids (epoprostenol, trepoprostenil, iloprost), endothelin receptor antagonists (bosentan, ambrisentan) and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil). This review discusses the current state of art regarding to epidemiologic aspects of PH, diagnostic approaches and the current classification of PH. In addition, currently available specific PAH therapy is discussed as well as future treatments.",1
23829686,"The standard approach to determine unique or shared genetic factors across populations is to identify risk alleles in one population and investigate replication in others. However, since populations differ in DNA sequence information, allele frequencies, effect sizes, and linkage disequilibrium patterns, SNP association using a uniform stringent threshold on p values may not be reproducible across populations. Here, we developed rank-based methods to investigate shared or population-specific loci and pathways for childhood asthma across individuals of diverse ancestry. We performed genome-wide association studies on 859,790 SNPs genotyped in 527 affected offspring trios of European, African, and Hispanic ancestry using publically available asthma database in the Genotypes and Phenotypes database.",1
23817569,"Allergic disease is very common and carries substantial public-health burdens. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide associations with self-reported cat, dust-mite and pollen allergies in 53,862 individuals. We used generalized estimating equations to model shared and allergy-specific genetic effects. We identified 16 shared susceptibility loci with association P<5×10(-8), including 8 loci previously associated with asthma, as well as 4p14 near TLR1, TLR6 and TLR10 (rs2101521, P=5.3×10(-21)); 6p21.33 near HLA-C and MICA (rs9266772, P=3.2×10(-12)); 5p13.1 near PTGER4 (rs7720838, P=8.2×10(-11)); 2q33.1 in PLCL1 (rs10497813, P=6.1×10(-10)), 3q28 in LPP (rs9860547, P=1.2×10(-9)); 20q13.2 in NFATC2 (rs6021270, P=6.9×10(-9)), 4q27 in ADAD1 (rs17388568, P=3.9×10(-8)); and 14q21.1 near FOXA1 and TTC6 (rs1998359, P=4.8×10(-8)). We identified one locus with substantial evidence of differences in effects across allergies at 6p21.32 in the class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region (rs17533090, P=1.7×10(-12)), which was strongly associated with cat allergy. Our study sheds new light on the shared etiology of immune and autoimmune disease.",1
23816990,"Mass spectrometry based proteomics has facilitated sperm composition studies in several mammalian species but no studies have been undertaken in non-human primate species. Here we report the analysis of the 1247 proteins that comprise the Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) sperm proteome (termed the MacSP). Comparative analysis with previously characterized mouse and human sperm proteomes reveals substantial levels of orthology (47% and 40% respectively) and widespread overlap of functional categories based on Gene Ontology analyses. Approximately 10% of macaque sperm genes (113/1247) are significantly under-expressed in the testis as compared with other tissues, which may reflect proteins specifically acquired during epididymal maturation. Phylogenetic and genomic analyses of three MacSP ADAMs (A-Disintegrin and Metalloprotease proteins), ADAM18-, 20- and 21-like, provides empirical support for sperm genes functioning in non-human primate taxa which have been subsequently lost in the lineages leading to humans. The MacSP contains proteasome proteins of the 20S core subunit, the 19S proteasome activator complex and an alternate proteasome activator PA200, raising the possibility that proteasome activity is present in mature sperm. Robust empirical characterization of the Rhesus sperm proteome should greatly expand the possibility for targeted molecular studies of spermatogenesis and fertilization in a commonly used model species for human infertility.",1
23810013,"The development of breast cancer resistance to endocrine therapies may result from an increase in cellular plasticity, permitting the emergence of a hormone-independent tumor. ADAM proteins are multidomain transmembrane proteins that have a diverse array of functions in both natural physiology and disease. A number of ADAM proteins have been implicated in the occurrence of breast cancer, including ADAM 9, ADAM12, ADAM15, ADAM17, ADAM22, and ADAM28. ADAM22 expression is driven by the coactivator protein SRC-1 in response to tamoxifen treatment in the resistant setting. ADAM22 is an ER-independent predictor of disease-free survival. LGI1 is a neuropeptide that binds ADAM22 in the nervous system. In addition to being a ligand for ADAM11, ADAM22, and ADAM23, LGI1 may play a role as a tumor suppressor. Furthermore, LGI1 may act to reduce cell migration and may impair proliferation. Therapies based on LGI1 may provide a building block for future therapies in ADAM22-positive breast cancer.",1
23803025,"Dilantin sodium (phenytoin) is an antiepileptic drug, which is routinely used to control generalized tonic clonic seizure and partial seizure episodes. A few case reports of oral squamous cell carcinomas arising from regions of phenytoin induced gingival overgrowth (GO), and overexpression of mitogenic factors and p53 have presented this condition as a pathology with potential to transform into malignancy. We recently investigated the genetic status of p53 and H-ras, which are known to be frequently mutated in Indian oral carcinomas in GO tissues and found them to only contain wild type sequences, which suggested a non-neoplastic nature of phenytoin induced GO. However, besides p53 and H-ras, other oncogenes and tumor suppressors such as PIK3CA, p14ARF, p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1, are frequently altered in oral squamous cell carcinoma, and hence are required to be analyzed in phenytoin induced GO tissues to be affirmative of its non-neoplastic nature.",1
23799629,"Many homeobox genes encode transcription factors with regulatory roles in animal and plant development. Homeobox genes are found in almost all eukaryotes, and have diversified into 11 gene classes and over 100 gene families in animal evolution, and 10 to 14 gene classes in plants. The largest group in animals is the ANTP class which includes the well-known Hox genes, plus other genes implicated in development including ParaHox (Cdx, Xlox, Gsx), Evx, Dlx, En, NK4, NK3, Msx, and Nanog. Genomic data suggest that the ANTP class diversified by extensive tandem duplication to generate a large array of genes, including an NK gene cluster and a hypothetical ProtoHox gene cluster that duplicated to generate Hox and ParaHox genes. Expression and functional data suggest that NK, Hox, and ParaHox gene clusters acquired distinct roles in patterning the mesoderm, nervous system, and gut. The PRD class is also diverse and includes Pax2/5/8, Pax3/7, Pax4/6, Gsc, Hesx, Otx, Otp, and Pitx genes. PRD genes are not generally arranged in ancient genomic clusters, although the Dux, Obox, and Rhox gene clusters arose in mammalian evolution as did several non-clustered PRD genes. Tandem duplication and genome duplication expanded the number of homeobox genes, possibly contributing to the evolution of developmental complexity, but homeobox gene loss must not be ignored. Evolutionary changes to homeobox gene expression have also been documented, including Hox gene expression patterns shifting in concert with segmental diversification in vertebrates and crustaceans, and deletion of a Pitx1 gene enhancer in pelvic-reduced sticklebacks.

23782937,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease characterized by the deposition of excessive cholesterol in the arterial intima. Macrophage foam cells play a critical role in the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis. The generation of these cells is associated with imbalance of cholesterol influx, esterification and efflux. CD36 and scavenger receptor class A (SR-A) are mainly responsible for uptake of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol by macrophages. Acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT1) and neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (nCEH) regulate cholesterol esterification. ATP-binding cassette transporters A1(ABCA1), ABCG1 and scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) play crucial roles in macrophage cholesterol export. When inflow and esterification of cholesterol increase and/or its outflow decrease, the macrophages are ultimately transformed into lipid-laden foam cells, the prototypical cells in the atherosclerotic plaque. The aim of this review is to describe what is known about the mechanisms of cholesterol uptake, esterification and release in macrophages. An increased understanding of the process of macrophage foam cell formation will help to develop novel therapeutic interventions for atherosclerosis.",1
23781992,"The epidemics of obesity and diabetes most apparent in recent years had their origins with Thomas Edison's development of distributed electricity in New York City in 1882. His original direct current (DC) generators suffered serious commutator brush arcing which is a major source of high-frequency voltage transients (dirty electricity). From the onset of the electrical grid, electrified populations have been exposed to dirty electricity. Diesel generator sets are a major source of dirty electricity today and are used almost universally to electrify small islands and places unreachable by the conventional electric grid. This accounts for the fact that diabetes prevalence, fasting plasma glucose and obesity are highest on small islands and other places electrified by generator sets and lowest in places with low levels of electrification like sub-Saharan Africa and east and Southeast Asia.",0
23781210,"Many studies have confirmed the presence of a bilingual advantage which is manifested as enhanced cognitive and attention control. However, very few studies have investigated the role of second language proficiency on the modulation of conflict-monitoring in bilinguals. We investigated this by comparing high and low proficient Hindi-English bilinguals on a modified saccadic arrow Stroop task under different monitoring conditions, and tested the predictions of the bilingual executive control advantage proposal. The task of the participants was to make an eye movement toward the color patch in the same color as the central arrow, ignoring the patch to which the arrow was pointing. High-proficient bilinguals had overall faster saccade latency on all types of trials as compared to the low proficient bilinguals. The overall saccadic latency for high proficiency bilinguals was similarly affected by the different types of monitoring conditions, whereas conflict resolution advantage was found only for high monitoring demanding condition. The results support a conflict-monitoring account in a novel oculomotor task and also suggest that language proficiency could modulate executive control in bilinguals.",0
23780476,"The ""Life Course Perspective"" proposes that environmental exposures, including biological, physical, social, and behavioral factors, as well as life experiences, throughout the entire life span, influence health outcomes in current and future generations. Nutrition, from preconception to adulthood, encompasses all of these factors and has the potential to positively or negatively shape the individual or population health trajectories and their intergenerational differences. This paper applies the T2E2 model (timing, timeline, equity and environment), developed by Fine and Kotelchuck, as an overlay to examine advances in nutritional science, as well as the complex associations between life stages, nutrients, nutrigenomics, and access to healthy foods, that support the life course perspective. Examples of the application of nutrition to each of the four constructs are provided, as well as a strong recommendation for inclusion of nutrition as a key focal point for all health professionals as they address solutions to optimize health outcomes, both domestically and internationally. The science of nutrition provides strong evidence to support the concepts of the life course perspective. These findings lend urgency to the need to improve population health across the life span and over generations by ensuring ready access to micronutrient-dense foods, opportunities to balance energy intake with adequate physical activity and the need for biological, social, physical, and macro-level environments that support critical phases of human development. Recommendations for the application of the life course perspective, with a focus on the emerging knowledge of nutritional science, are offered in an effort to improve current maternal and child health programs, policies, and service delivery.",0
23756437,"ACTB and ACTG1 mutations have recently been reported to cause Baraitser-Winter syndrome (BRWS) - a rare condition characterized by ptosis, colobomata, neuronal migration disorder, distinct facial anomalies and intellectual disability. One of the patients carrying an ACTB mutation was previously diagnosed with Fryns-Aftimos syndrome (FAS), which is a rare and severe, multiple congenital anomaly (MCA) syndrome whose symptoms partially overlap with that of BRWS. However, several patients with Fryns-Aftimos were considered not to fit into the ACTB and ACTG1 spectrum because of their severe impairment and additional malformations. We report on three patients who had been diagnosed with FAS. All three patients carry a mutation in the ACTB gene. On the basis of the ACTB mutations and analysis of the clinical findings, we reclassify the diagnosis of these patients as severe BRWS. We suggest that mutations in ACTB cause a distinctly more severe phenotype than ACTG1 mutations, despite the structural similarity of beta- and gamma-actins and their overlapping expression pattern. We expand the spectrum of BRWS and confirm that FAS is not a separate entity but an early and severe manifestation of BRWS.",1
23751978,"Biodiversity is hierarchically structured both phylogenetically and functionally. Phylogenetic hierarchy is understood as a product of branching organic evolution as described by Darwin. Ecosystem biologists understand some aspects of functional hierarchy, such as food web architecture, as a product of evolutionary ecology; but functional hierarchy extends to much lower scales of organization than those studied by ecologists. We argue that the more general use of the term ""evolution"" employed by physicists and applied to non-living systems connects directly to the narrow biological meaning. Physical evolution is best understood as a thermodynamic phenomenon, and this perspective comfortably includes all of biological evolution. We suggest four dynamical factors that build on each other in a hierarchical fashion and set the stage for the Darwinian evolution of biological systems: (1) the entropic erosion of structure; (2) the construction of dissipative systems; (3) the reproduction of growing systems and (4) the historical memory accrued to populations of reproductive agents by the acquisition of hereditary mechanisms. A particular level of evolution can underpin the emergence of higher levels, but evolutionary processes persist at each level in the hierarchy. We also argue that particular evolutionary processes can occur at any level of the hierarchy where they are not obstructed by material constraints. This theoretical framework provides an extensive basis for understanding natural selection as a multilevel process. The extensive literature on thermodynamics in turn provides an important advantage to this perspective on the evolution of higher levels of organization, such as the evolution of altruism that can accompany the emergence of social organization.",0
23736297,"More than 200 mutations in the skeletal muscle α-actin gene (ACTA1) cause either dominant or recessive skeletal muscle disease. Currently, there are no specific therapies. Cardiac α-actin is 99% identical to skeletal muscle α-actin and the predominant actin isoform in fetal muscle. We previously showed cardiac α-actin can substitute for skeletal muscle α-actin, preventing the early postnatal death of Acta1 knock-out mice, which model recessive ACTA1 disease. Dominant ACTA1 disease is caused by the presence of 'poison' mutant actin protein. Experimental and anecdotal evidence nevertheless indicates that the severity of dominant ACTA1 disease is modulated by the relative amount of mutant skeletal muscle α-actin protein present. Thus, we investigated whether transgenic over-expression of cardiac α-actin in postnatal skeletal muscle could ameliorate the phenotype of mouse models of severe dominant ACTA1 disease. In one model, lethality of ACTA1(D286G). Acta1(+/-) mice was reduced from ∼59% before 30 days of age to ∼12%. In the other model, Acta1(H40Y), in which ∼80% of male mice die by 5 months of age, the cardiac α-actin transgene did not significantly improve survival. Hence cardiac α-actin over-expression is likely to be therapeutic for at least some dominant ACTA1 mutations. The reason cardiac α-actin was not effective in the Acta1(H40Y) mice is uncertain. We showed that the Acta1(H40Y) mice had endogenously elevated levels of cardiac α-actin in skeletal muscles, a finding not reported in dominant ACTA1 patients.",1
23735562,"Rearrangements affecting the MLL gene in hematological malignancies are associated with poor prognosis. Most often they are reciprocal translocations and more rarely complex forms involving at least 3 chromosomes. We describe an unusual case with cutaneous leukemic infiltrates that waxed and waned until progression to acute myeloid leukemia, AML-M5. The leukemic cells harbored a novel apparent 3-way translocation t(6;19;11)(p22.2;p13.1;q23.3). We utilized advanced molecular cytogenetic methods including 24-color karyotyping, high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and DNA sequencing to characterize the genomic complement in the leukemic cells from aspirated bone marrow cells at AML diagnosis. Karyotyping showed 47,XY,t(6;19;11)(p22;p13;q23),+der(6)t(6;11)(p22;q23)[17]/48,sl,+8[3]/48,sl,+8,der(12)t(1;12)(q11;p13)[3]/ 48,sdl,der(Y)t(Y;1)(q12;q11),+8[7] conferring MLL-ELL fusion. Oligo-aCGH analysis confirmed gains of 6p22qter and 11q23.3qter involving the CMAHP and MLL genes, respectively. DNA sequencing disclosed an additional breakpoint at 6p24.3 (at RREB1 gene). Retrospective fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed presence of the MLL-involving rearrangement in the initial stages of disease before clear morphological signs of bone marrow involvement. The patient responded well to therapy and remains in remission>6 years from diagnosis. This apparent 3-way translocation is remarkable because of its rarity and presentation with myeloid sarcoma, and may, as more cases are characterized, further our understanding onto how such complex translocations contribute to promote leukemogenesis and respond to therapy.",1
23734346,"Colon cancer is the second most lethal cancer; approximately 600,000 people die of it annually in the world. Colon carcinogenesis generally follows a slow and stepwise process of accumulation of mutations under the influence of environmental and epigenetic factors. To adopt a personalized (tailored) cancer therapy approach and to improve current strategies for prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy overall, advanced understanding of molecular events associated with colon carcinogenesis is necessary. A contemporary approach that combines genetics, epigenomics, and signaling pathways has revealed many genetic/genomic alterations associated with colon cancer progression and their relationships to a genomic instability phenotype prevalent in colon cancer. In this review, we describe the relationship between gene mutations associated with colon carcinogenesis and a genomic instability phenotype, and we discuss possible clinical applications of genomic instability studies. Colon carcinogenesis is associated with frequent mutations in several pathways that include phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, adenomatous polyposis coli, p53 (TP53), F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7, transforming growth factor-β, chromosome cohesion, and K-RAS. These genes frequently mutated in pathways affecting colon cancer were designated colon cancer (CAN) genes. Aberrations in major colon CAN genes have a causal relationship to genomic instability. Conversely, genomic instability itself plays a role in colon carcinogenesis in experimental settings, as demonstrated in transgenic mouse models with high genomic instability. Thus, there is a feedback-type relationship between CAN gene mutations and genomic instability. These genetic/genomic studies have led to emerging efforts to apply the knowledge to colon cancer prognosis and to targeted therapy.",1
23719227,"In the 2 decades between when the existence of vitamins was first postulated and when they were isolated, scientists and research physicians could produce no conclusive evidence for their existence from the laboratory or clinic. By the time the first vitamin was chemically isolated, vitamins were already widely accepted by scientists, clinicians, the public, and government agencies. In the period between when vitamins were postulated and the Nobel Prize was awarded for their discovery, a debate over nomenclature served as a substitute for a priority dispute. The most popular term ""vitamine"" was introduced by Casimer Funk in 1912 and was changed to ""vitamin"" by Cecil Drummond in 1920. Initial conditions surrounding the discovery of vitamins, including World War I, necessitated the creation of unusual networks for the dissemination of scientific information about vitamins. In Great Britain, research institutes, government agencies, and individual researchers were instrumental in creating a set of national and international networks for the dissemination of information from research laboratories to hospitals, physicians, pharmaceutical houses, and the public. These networks of dissemination still exert an influence on how scientific information about vitamins is communicated to the public today.",0
23700467,"Recent advance in sequencing technology has enabled comprehensive profiling of genetic alterations in cancer. We have established a targeted sequencing platform using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for clinical use, which can provide mutation and copy number variation data. NGS was performed with paired-end library enriched with exons of 183 cancer-related genes. Normal and tumor tissue pairs of 60 colorectal adenocarcinomas were used to test feasibility. Somatic mutation and copy number alteration were analyzed. A total of 526 somatic non-synonymous sequence variations were found in 113 genes. Among these, 278 single nucleotide variations were 232 different somatic point mutations. 216 SNV were 79 known single nucleotide polymorphisms in the dbSNP. 32 indels were 28 different indel mutations. Median number of mutated gene per tumor was 4 (range 0-23). Copy number gain (>X2 fold) was found in 65 genes in 40 patients, whereas copy number loss (<X0.5 fold) was found in 103 genes in 39 patients. The most frequently altered genes (mutation and/or copy number alteration) were APC in 35 patients (58%), TP53 in 34 (57%), and KRAS in 24 (40%). Altered gene list revealed ErbB signaling pathway as the most commonly involved pathway (25 patients, 42%). Targeted sequencing platform using NGS technology is feasible for clinical use and provides comprehensive genetic alteration data.",1

23644456,"Low bone mineral density (BMD) is used as a parameter of osteoporosis. Genome-wide association studies of BMD have hitherto focused on BMD as a quantitative trait, yielding common variants of small effects that contribute to the population diversity in BMD. Here we use BMD as a dichotomous trait, searching for variants that may have a direct effect on the risk of pathologically low BMD rather than on the regulation of BMD in the healthy population. Through whole-genome sequencing of Icelandic individuals, we found a rare nonsense mutation within the leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 4 (LGR4) gene (c.376C>T) that is strongly associated with low BMD, and with osteoporotic fractures. This mutation leads to termination of LGR4 at position 126 and fully disrupts its function. The c.376C>T mutation is also associated with electrolyte imbalance, late onset of menarche and reduced testosterone levels, as well as an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and biliary tract cancer. Interestingly, the phenotype of carriers of the c.376C>T mutation overlaps that of Lgr4 mutant mice.",1
23642732,"A negative relationship between total bilirubin concentration (TBili) and CVD risk has been documented in a series of epidemiological studies. In addition, TBili is thought to be under strong genetic regulation via the UGT1A gene family, suggesting it may be a heritable CVD risk factor. However, few studies directly relate TBili-associated UGT1A variants to CVD severity or outcome. This study replicated the genetic association for TBili in the Diabetes Heart Study (DHS), and examined the relationships of TBili-associated SNPs with measures of subclinical CVD and mortality.",1
23630070,"Mesothelioma is a rare but very aggressive tumor derived from mesothelial cells. A number of often complex but nonrandom cytogenetic abnormalities have been found in these tumors, resulting in loss of chromosome bands 14q32 and 22q12 in more than 35% of the cases. In this study, we used RNA sequencing to search for fusion transcripts in a mesothelioma carrying a t(14;22)(q32;q12) as the sole chromosomal aberration and found an EWSR1-YY1 and its reciprocal YY1-EWSR1 fusion transcript. Screening 15 additional cases of mesothelioma from which we had RNA but no cytogenetic information, we identified one more tumor carrying an EWSR1-YY1 fusion gene but not the reciprocal YY1-EWSR1 transcript. RT-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing showed that in both cases exon 8 of EWSR1 (nucleotide 1,139, accession number NM_013986 version 3, former exon 7 in sequence with accession number X66899) was fused to exon 2 of YY1 (nucleotide 1,160, accession number NM_003403 version 3). The EWSR1 breakpoint in exon 8 in the EWSR1-YY1 chimeric transcript is similar to what is found in other fusions involving EWSR1 such as EWSR1-FLI1, EWSR1-DDIT3, and EWSR1-ATF1. The EWSR1-YY1-encoded protein is an abnormal transcription factor with the transactivation domain of EWSR1 and the DNA-binding domain of YY1. This is the first study to detect a specific fusion gene in mesothelioma (the reason how frequent the EWSR1-YY1 fusion is remains uncertain) and also the first time that direct involvement of YY1 in oncogenesis has been demonstrated.",1
23620144,"Job-related exhaustion is the core dimension of burnout, a work-related stress syndrome that has several negative health consequences. In this study, we explored the molecular genetic background of job-related exhaustion. A genome-wide analysis of job-related exhaustion was performed in the GENMETS subcohort (n = 1256) of the Finnish population-based Health 2000 study. Replication analyses included an analysis of the strongest associations in the rest of the Health 2000 sample (n = 1660 workers) and in three independent populations (the FINRISK population cohort, n = 10 753; two occupational cohorts, total n = 1451). Job-related exhaustion was ascertained using a standard self-administered questionnaire (the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)-GS exhaustion scale in the Health 2000 sample and the occupational cohorts) or a single question (FINRISK). A variant located in an intron of UST, uronyl-2-sulfotransferase (rs13219957), gave the strongest statistical evidence in the initial genome-wide study (P = 1.55 × 10(-7)), and was associated with job-related exhaustion in all the replication sets (P < 0.05; P = 6.75 × 10(-7) from the meta-analysis). Consistent with studies of mood disorders, individual common genetic variants did not have any strong effect on job-related exhaustion. However, the nominally significant signals from the allelic variant of UST in four separate samples suggest that this variant might be a weak risk factor for job-related exhaustion. Together with the previously reported associations of other dermatan/chondroitin sulfate genes with mood disorders, these results indicate a potential molecular pathway for stress-related traits and mark a candidate region for further studies of job-related and general exhaustion.",1
23620142,"Increased systemic levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) are associated with the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). To identify the genetic factors that are associated with circulating MPO levels, we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a gene-centric analysis in subjects of European ancestry and African Americans (AAs). A locus on chromosome 1q31.1 containing the complement factor H (CFH) gene was strongly associated with serum MPO levels in 9305 subjects of European ancestry (lead SNP rs800292; P = 4.89 × 10(-41)) and in 1690 AA subjects (rs505102; P = 1.05 × 10(-8)). Gene-centric analyses in 8335 subjects of European ancestry additionally identified two rare MPO coding sequence variants that were associated with serum MPO levels (rs28730837, P = 5.21 × 10(-12); rs35897051, P = 3.32 × 10(-8)). A GWAS for plasma MPO levels in 9260 European ancestry subjects identified a chromosome 17q22 region near MPO that was significantly associated (lead SNP rs6503905; P = 2.94 × 10(-12)), but the CFH locus did not exhibit evidence of association with plasma MPO levels. Functional analyses revealed that rs800292 was associated with levels of complement proteins in serum. Variants at chromosome 17q22 also had pleiotropic cis effects on gene expression. In a case-control analysis of ∼80 000 subjects from CARDIoGRAM, none of the identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with CAD. These results suggest that distinct genetic factors regulate serum and plasma MPO levels, which may have relevance for various acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. The clinical implications for CAD and a better understanding of the functional basis for the association of CFH and MPO variants with circulating MPO levels require further study.",1
23612709,"Myoblast fusion is a critical process that contributes to the growth of muscle during development and to the regeneration of myofibers upon injury. Myoblasts fuse with each other as well as with multinucleated myotubes to enlarge the myofiber. Initial studies demonstrated that myoblast fusion requires extracellular calcium and changes in cell membrane topography and cytoskeletal organization. More recent studies have identified several cell-surface and intracellular proteins that mediate myoblast fusion. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that myoblast fusion is also regulated by the activation of specific cell-signaling pathways that lead to the expression of genes whose products are essential for the fusion process and for modulating the activity of molecules that are involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement. Here, we review the roles of the major signaling pathways in mammalian myoblast fusion.",0

23604121,"Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5 (ACP5), which is essential for bone resorption and osteoclast differentiation, promotes cell motility through the modulation of focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation. However, whether ACP5 contributes to the metastasis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. In this paper, a complementary DNA microarray, serial deletion, site-directed mutagenesis and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that ACP5 is a direct transcriptional target of Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1). ACP5 expression was markedly higher in HCC tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues. ACP5 overexpression was correlated with microvascular invasion, poor differentiation and higher tumor-node-metastasis stage. HCC patients with positive ACP5 expression had poorer prognoses than those with negative ACP5 expression. A multivariate analysis revealed that ACP5 expression was an independent and significant risk factor for disease recurrence and reduced-patient survival following curative resection. Transwell assays and an orthotopic metastatic model showed that the upregulation of ACP5 promoted HCC invasion and lung metastasis, whereas ACP5 knockdown inhibited these processes. The knockdown of ACP5 significantly attenuated FoxM1-enhanced invasion and lung metastasis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that ACP5 expression was positively correlated with FoxM1 expression in human HCC tissues, and their coexpression was associated with poor prognoses. In summary, ACP5 is a direct transcriptional and functional target of FoxM1. This novel FoxM1/ACP5 signaling pathway promotes HCC metastasis and may be a candidate biomarker for prognosis and a target for new therapies.",1
23603761,"We used the Immunochip array to analyze 2,816 individuals with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), comprising the most common subtypes (oligoarticular and rheumatoid factor-negative polyarticular JIA), and 13,056 controls. We confirmed association of 3 known JIA risk loci (the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, PTPN22 and PTPN2) and identified 14 loci reaching genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)) for the first time. Eleven additional new regions showed suggestive evidence of association with JIA (P < 1 × 10(-6)). Dense mapping of loci along with bioinformatics analysis refined the associations to one gene in each of eight regions, highlighting crucial pathways, including the interleukin (IL)-2 pathway, in JIA disease pathogenesis. The entire Immunochip content, the HLA region and the top 27 loci (P < 1 × 10(-6)) explain an estimated 18, 13 and 6% of the risk of JIA, respectively. In summary, this is the largest collection of JIA cases investigated so far and provides new insight into the genetic basis of this childhood autoimmune disease.",1

Subtype‑specific PPP2R1A mutations have been frequently observed in ovarian and endometrial cancer. Mutations in the paralogous genes were frequently observed in human malignancies. Thus, the present study aimed to analyze the mutation frequencies of the paralogous PPP2R1A and PPP2R1B genes in patients with primary and secondary ovarian cancer. A total of 251 patients with primary (n=234) and secondary (n=17) ovarian cancer were analyzed for the presence of PPP2R1A and PPP2R1B mutations by direct sequencing. For PPP2R1A, a heterozygous, somatic mutation (c.771G>T, p.W257C) was identified in 1 out of 37 patients (2.7%) with primary ovarian endometrioid carcinoma. The mutant sample was that of a 46‑year‑old female, who was also diagnosed with ectopic endometriosis in the benign ovary. No PPP2R1A mutations were detected in the remaining 250 patients with ovarian cancer. For PPP2R1B, no mutations were detected in our samples. The results of this study suggested that PPP2R1A mutations are less common in Chinese patients with ovarian cancer when compared with European and American patients. Furthermore, our study also supported previous observations that PPP2R1B mutations were absent in ovarian cancer, suggesting that PPP2R1B mutations are not actively involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer.",1
23583669,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Hepatocarcinogenesis is a multistep process mainly associated with persistent infection with hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) viruses and always involving the accumulation of genetic alterations over decades of chronic liver disease. Mutations in TP53 and CTNNB1 genes are considered the cancer drivers for HCC development with variable frequencies depending on the etiology. Here we present a comprehensive review evaluating somatic mutations in TP53 and CTNNB1 genes in HBV- and HCV-related HCCs. Moreover, we report the mutational analysis of TP53 (exons 4-9) and CTNNB1 (exon 3) as well as PIK3CA (exon 9) genes in HCC from Southern Italy. The overall mutation frequency of TP53 and CTNNB1 was 33.3%, while hotspot variations in PIK3CA were completely absent. CTNNB1 mutations were significantly associated with young age (P=0.019) and moderately/poorly differentiated HCV-related HCC (P=0.015). The extended analysis of genetic alterations will help to identify molecular markers for liver cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment of HBV and HCV-associated liver cancer.",1
23580382,"Endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS) are genetically heterogeneous uterine tumors in which a JAZF1-SUZ12 chimeric gene resulting from the chromosomal translocation t(7;17)(p15;q21) as well as PHF1 rearrangements (in chromosomal band 6p21) with formation of JAZF1-PHF1, EPC1-PHF1, and MEAF6-PHF1 chimeras have been described. Here, we investigated two ESS characterized cytogenetically by the presence of a der(22)t(X;22)(p11;q13). Whole transcriptome sequencing one of the tumors identified a ZC3H7-BCOR chimeric transcript. Reverse transciptase-PCR with the ZC3H7B forward and BCOR reverse primer combinations confirmed the presence of a ZC3H7-BCOR chimeric transcript in both ESS carrying a der(22)t(X;22) but not in a control ESS with t(1;6) and the MEAF6-PHF1 fusion. Sequencing of the amplified cDNA fragments showed that in both cases ESS exon 10 of ZC3H7B (from 22q13; accession number NM_017590 version 4) was fused to exon 8 of BCOR (from Xp11; accession number NM_001123385 version 1). Reciprocal multiple BCOR-ZC3H7B cDNA fragments were amplified in only one case suggesting that ZC3H7B-BCOR, on the der(22)t(X;22), is the pathogenetically important fusion gene. The putative ZC3H7B-BCOR protein would contain the tetratricopeptide repeats and LD motif from ZC3H7B and the AF9 binding site (1093-1233aa), the 3 ankyrin repeats (1410-1509 aa), and the NSPC1 binding site of BCOR. Although the presence of these motifs suggests various functions of the chimeric protein, it is possible that its most important role may be in epigenetic regulation. Whether or not the (patho)genetic subsets JAZF1-SUZ12, PHF1 rearrangements, and ZC3H7B-BCOR correspond to any phenotypic, let alone clinically important, differences in ESS remain unknown.",1
23566987,"Drug eruptions often have nonspecific clinical findings, and the evaluation of the probability of an eruption being a drug-induced event is difficult. A few types of drug eruption do not present such problems, and the fixed drug eruption is one of those whose clinical findings are specific enough to allow a diagnosis. The fixed drug eruption is a commonly reported type of drug eruption. The incidence of fixed drug eruptions has tended to increase, although the overall number of drug eruption cases has decreased. This is one of the reasons why fixed drug eruptions are familiar to dermatologists. The most characteristic findings of a fixed drug eruption are recurrence of similar lesions at the same sites and healing with residual hyperpigmentation. The residual hyperpigmentation serves as an indicator of site recognition. Diagnosis is not always easy; for example, as is the case for nonpigmenting fixed drug eruptions, which do not have any residual hyperpigmentation. The development of molecular biology may help to clarify the pathogenesis of fixed drug eruptions, but the reason for their recurrence on the same sites is still unknown. Identification of the causative drug or drugs is essential for the management of fixed drug eruptions, as it is for other drug eruptions. The causative drug or drugs and cross-reactants should be avoided to prevent recurrence. To date, rechallenge is the most reliable method of identifying causative drugs, but increasingly the use of skin tests has gained the attention of investigators. The validity and the problems of skin tests are discussed, and an approach to the clinical management of fixed drug eruptions is presented.",0
23563607,"Approaches exploiting trait distribution extremes may be used to identify loci associated with common traits, but it is unknown whether these loci are generalizable to the broader population. In a genome-wide search for loci associated with the upper versus the lower 5th percentiles of body mass index, height and waist-to-hip ratio, as well as clinical classes of obesity, including up to 263,407 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 4 new loci (IGFBP4, H6PD, RSRC1 and PPP2R2A) influencing height detected in the distribution tails and 7 new loci (HNF4G, RPTOR, GNAT2, MRPS33P4, ADCY9, HS6ST3 and ZZZ3) for clinical classes of obesity. Further, we find a large overlap in genetic structure and the distribution of variants between traits based on extremes and the general population and little etiological heterogeneity between obesity subgroups.",1
23555300,"Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF) biologic therapy is a widely used treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unknown why some RA patients fail to respond adequately to anti-TNF therapy, which limits the development of clinical biomarkers to predict response or new drugs to target refractory cases. To understand the biological basis of response to anti-TNF therapy, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of more than 2 million common variants in 2,706 RA patients from 13 different collections. Patients were treated with one of three anti-TNF medications: etanercept (n = 733), infliximab (n = 894), or adalimumab (n = 1,071). We identified a SNP (rs6427528) at the 1q23 locus that was associated with change in disease activity score (ΔDAS) in the etanercept subset of patients (P = 8 × 10(-8)), but not in the infliximab or adalimumab subsets (P>0.05). The SNP is predicted to disrupt transcription factor binding site motifs in the 3' UTR of an immune-related gene, CD84, and the allele associated with better response to etanercept was associated with higher CD84 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (P = 1 × 10(-11) in 228 non-RA patients and P = 0.004 in 132 RA patients). Consistent with the genetic findings, higher CD84 gene expression correlated with lower cross-sectional DAS (P = 0.02, n = 210) and showed a non-significant trend for better ΔDAS in a subset of RA patients with gene expression data (n = 31, etanercept-treated). A small, multi-ethnic replication showed a non-significant trend towards an association among etanercept-treated RA patients of Portuguese ancestry (n = 139, P = 0.4), but no association among patients of Japanese ancestry (n = 151, P = 0.8). Our study demonstrates that an allele associated with response to etanercept therapy is also associated with CD84 gene expression, and further that CD84 expression correlates with disease activity. These findings support a model in which CD84 genotypes and/or expression may serve as a useful biomarker for response to etanercept treatment in RA patients of European ancestry.",1
23512405,"Inflammatory bowel disease is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastro intestinal tract that manifests as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

23512301,"The inorganic matrix of the siliceous skeletal elements of sponges, that is, spicules, is formed of amorphous biosilica. Until a decade ago, it remained unclear how the hard biosilica monoliths of the spicules are formed in sponges that live in a silica-poor (<50 μM) aquatic environment. The following two discoveries caused a paradigm shift and allowed an elucidation of the processes underlying spicule formation; first the discovery that in the spicules only one major protein, silicatein, exists and second, that this protein displays a bio-catalytical, enzymatic function. These findings caused a paradigm shift, since silicatein is the first enzyme that catalyzes the formation of an inorganic polymer from an inorganic monomeric substrate. In the present review the successive steps, following the synthesis of the silicatein product, biosilica, and resulting in the formation of the hard monolithic spicules is given. The new insight is assumed to open new horizons in the field of biotechnology and also in biomedicine.",0
23505185,"Inflammation is an important factor linking abdominal obesity with insulin resistance and related cardiometabolic risk. A genome-wide association study of adiposity-related traits performed in the Quebec Family Study (QFS) revealed that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the LRRFIP1 gene (rs11680012) was associated with abdominal adiposity (P = 4.6 × 10(-6)).",1
23485875,"The evolution of resistance to parasites has been the focus of numerous theoretical studies and several mechanisms, ranging from innate to acquired immune responses, have been considered. Life-history theory predicts that long-lived species should invest more resources into maintenance and immunity than short-lived species. Here, we provide further theoretical and empirical support for this hypothesis. First, an analysis of the evolution of the persistence of immune protection in a theoretical framework accounting for maternal transfer of immunity reveals that longer-lived hosts are expected to invest in more persistent intragenerational and transgenerational immune responses. Controlling for phylogenetic structure and for the confounding effect of catabolic activity, we further showed that immunoglobulin half-life and longevity are positively correlated in mammal species. Our study confirms that persistence of immunity has evolved as part of elaborate anti-parasitic defence strategies.",0
23475535,"Integrative gene transfer is widely used for bioproduction, drug screening, and therapeutic applications but usual viral methods lead to random and multicopy insertions, contribute to unstable transgene expression and can disturb endogenous gene expression. Homologous targeting of an expression cassette using rare-cutting endonucleases is a potential solution; however the number of studied loci remains limited. Furthermore, the behavior and performance of various types of gene cassettes following gene targeting is poorly defined. Here we have evaluated three loci for gene targeting, including one locus compatible with the proposed Safe Harbor criteria for human translational applications. Using optimized conditions for homologous gene targeting, reporter genes under the control of different promoters were efficiently inserted at each locus in both sense and antisense orientations. Sustainable expression was achieved at all three loci without detectable disturbance of flanking gene expression. However, the promoter, the integration locus and the cassette orientation have a strong impact on transgene expression. Finally, single targeted integrations exhibited greatly improved transgene expression stability versus multicopy or random integration. Taken together, our data suggest a potential set of loci for site-specific transgene integration, suitable for a variety of biotechnological applications.",0
23463987,"In the past few years, the use of microwave energy to heat chemical reactions has become an increasingly popular theme in the scientific community. This nonclassical heating technique has slowly progressed from a laboratory curiosity to an established method commonly used both in academia and in industry. Because of its efficiency, microwave heating dramatically reduces reaction times (from days and hours to minutes and seconds) and improves product purities or material properties among other advantages. Since the early days of microwave chemistry, researchers have observed rate-accelerations and, in some cases, altered product distributions as compared with reactions carried out using classical oil-bath heating. As a result, researchers have speculated that so-called specific or nonthermal microwave effects could be responsible for these differences. Much of the debate has centered on the question of whether the electromagnetic field can exert a direct influence on a chemical transformation outside of the simple macroscopic change in bulk reaction temperature. In 2009, our group developed a relatively simple ""trick"" that allows us to rapidly evaluate whether an observed effect seen in a microwave-assisted reaction results from a purely thermal phenomenon, or involves specific or nonthermal microwave effects. We use a microwave reaction vessel made from silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic. Because of its high microwave absorptivity, the vessel shields its contents from the electromagnetic field. As a result, we can easily mimic a conventionally heated autoclave experiment inside a microwave reactor under carefully controlled reaction conditions. The switch from an almost microwave transparent glass (Pyrex) to a strongly microwave absorbing SiC reaction vial under otherwise identical reaction conditions (temperature profiles, pressure, stirring speed) then allows us to carefully evaluate the influence of the electromagnetic field on the particular chemical transformation. Over the past five years we have subjected a wide variety of chemical transformations, including organic reactions, preparations of inorganic nanoparticles, and the hydrolysis of proteins, to the ""SiC test."" In nearly all of the studied examples, we obtained identical results from reactions carried out in Pyrex vials and those carried out in SiC vials. The data obtained from these investigations confirm that in the overwhelming majority of cases a bulk temperature phenomenon drives the enhancements in microwave chemistry and that the electromagnetic field has no direct influence on the reaction pathway.",0
23459443,"Variability in response to drug use is common and heritable, suggesting that genome-wide pharmacogenomics studies may help explain the 'missing heritability' of complex traits. Here, we describe four independent analyses in 33 781 participants of European ancestry from 10 cohorts that were designed to identify genetic variants modifying the effects of drugs on QT interval duration (QT). Each analysis cross-sectionally examined four therapeutic classes: thiazide diuretics (prevalence of use=13.0%), tri/tetracyclic antidepressants (2.6%), sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents (2.9%) and QT-prolonging drugs as classified by the University of Arizona Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics (4.4%). Drug-gene interactions were estimated using covariable-adjusted linear regression and results were combined with fixed-effects meta-analysis. Although drug-single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) interactions were biologically plausible and variables were well-measured, findings from the four cross-sectional meta-analyses were null (Pinteraction>5.0 × 10(-8)). Simulations suggested that additional efforts, including longitudinal modeling to increase statistical power, are likely needed to identify potentially important pharmacogenomic effects.",1
23455636,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause of blindness in older individuals. To accelerate the understanding of AMD biology and help design new therapies, we executed a collaborative genome-wide association study, including >17,100 advanced AMD cases and >60,000 controls of European and Asian ancestry. We identified 19 loci associated at P < 5 × 10(-8). These loci show enrichment for genes involved in the regulation of complement activity, lipid metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis. Our results include seven loci with associations reaching P < 5 × 10(-8) for the first time, near the genes COL8A1-FILIP1L, IER3-DDR1, SLC16A8, TGFBR1, RAD51B, ADAMTS9 and B3GALTL. A genetic risk score combining SNP genotypes from all loci showed similar ability to distinguish cases and controls in all samples examined. Our findings provide new directions for biological, genetic and therapeutic studies of AMD.",1
23415669,"Recent genome-wide association studies have revealed an association between variation at the ADAMTS7 locus and susceptibility to coronary artery disease (CAD). Furthermore, in a population-based study cohort, we observed an inverse association between atherosclerosis prevalence and rs3825807, a nonsynonymous SNP (A to G) leading to a Ser-to-Pro substitution in the prodomain of the protease ADAMTS7. In light of these data, we sought a mechanistic explanation for this association. We found that ADAMTS7 accumulated in smooth muscle cells in coronary and carotid atherosclerotic plaques. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of the G/G genotype for rs3825807 had reduced migratory ability, and conditioned media of VSMCs of the G/G genotype contained less of the cleaved form of thrombospondin-5, an ADAMTS7 substrate that had been shown to be produced by VSMCs and inhibit VSMC migration. Furthermore, we found that there was a reduction in the amount of cleaved ADAMTS7 prodomain in media conditioned by VSMCs of the G/G genotype and that the Ser-to-Pro substitution affected ADAMTS7 prodomain cleavage. The results of our study indicate that rs3825807 has an effect on ADAMTS7 maturation, thrombospondin-5 cleavage, and VSMC migration, with the variant associated with protection from atherosclerosis and CAD rendering a reduction in ADAMTS7 function.",1
23401653,"Corneal curvature is a key determinant of the refractive power of the eye. Variants in two genes, FKBP12-rapamycin complex-associated protein 1 (FRAP1) on chromosome 1p36.2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) on chromosome 4q12, have shown genome-wide significant association with normal variation in corneal curvature in a study of subjects of Asian origin. Variants at the PDGFRA locus have also shown genome-wide significant association with corneal astigmatism. Whether these variants influence other ocular parameters such as axial length has yet to be reported. We performed a genome-wide association study for corneal curvature in white European subjects from a population-based birth cohort, with the aim of replicating and extending the above findings.",1

23392294,"Congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) can be associated with neurological abnormalities and an increased risk of melanoma. Mutations in NRAS, BRAF, and Tp53 have been described in individual CMN samples; however, their role in the pathogenesis of multiple CMN within the same subject and development of associated features has not been clear. We hypothesized that a single postzygotic mutation in NRAS could be responsible for multiple CMN in the same individual, as well as for melanocytic and nonmelanocytic central nervous system (CNS) lesions. From 15 patients, 55 samples with multiple CMN were sequenced after site-directed mutagenesis and enzymatic digestion of the wild-type allele. Oncogenic missense mutations in codon 61 of NRAS were found in affected neurological and cutaneous tissues of 12 out of 15 patients, but were absent from unaffected tissues and blood, consistent with NRAS mutation mosaicism. In 10 patients, the mutation was consistently c.181C>A, p.Q61K, and in 2 patients c.182A>G, p.Q61R. All 11 non-melanocytic and melanocytic CNS samples from 5 patients were mutation positive, despite NRAS rarely being reported as mutated in CNS tumors. Loss of heterozygosity was associated with the onset of melanoma in two cases, implying a multistep progression to malignancy. These results suggest that single postzygotic NRAS mutations are responsible for multiple CMN and associated neurological lesions in the majority of cases.",1
23385765,"Yersinia pestis is a highly virulent human pathogen and is the causative agent of bubonic plague. Spread through the bite of infected fleas, plague epidemics have marked important events in history, including the Justinian plague (6th century), the Black Death (14th century) which decimated nearly one quarter of the European population, and more recently the Orientalis plague (1894). To date, deaths are still being reported and, without treatment, the disease kills most people within 4 days. One of the thioesterases from Y. pestis, TesB, is a broad-range acyl-CoA thioesterase and is highly conserved within prokaryotes and throughout evolution, sharing sequence similarity with the HIV Nef binding protein ACOT8.

23371916,"Bilirubin is an effective antioxidant and is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci affecting serum total bilirubin levels. However, most of the studies were conducted in European populations and little attention has been devoted either to genetic variants associated with direct and indirect bilirubin levels or to the gene-environment interactions on bilirubin levels. In this study, a two-stage GWAS was performed to identify genetic variants associated with all types of bilirubin levels in 10,282 Han Chinese individuals. Gene-environment interactions were further examined. Briefly, two previously reported loci, UGT1A1 on 2q37 (rs6742078 and rs4148323, combined P = 1.44 × 10(-89) and P = 5.05 × 10(-69) , respectively) and SLCO1B3 on 12p12 (rs2417940, combined P = 6.93 × 10(-19) ) were successfully replicated. The two loci explained 9.2% and 0.9% of the total variations of total bilirubin levels, respectively. Ethnic genetic differences were observed between Chinese and European populations. More importantly, a significant interaction was found between rs2417940 in SLCO1B3 gene and smoking on total bilirubin levels (P = 1.99 × 10(-3) ). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2417940 had stronger effects on total bilirubin levels in nonsmokers than in smokers, suggesting that the effects of SLCO1B3 genotype on bilirubin levels were partly dependent on smoking status. Consistent associations and interactions were observed for serum direct and indirect bilirubin levels.",1
23351634,"It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that the total diet or overall pattern of food eaten is the most important focus of healthy eating. All foods can fit within this pattern if consumed in moderation with appropriate portion size and combined with physical activity. The Academy strives to communicate healthy eating messages that emphasize a balance of food and beverages within energy needs, rather than any one food or meal. Public policies and dietary patterns that support the total diet approach include the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet, MyPlate, Let's Move, Nutrition Facts labels, Healthy People 2020, and the Dietary Reference Intakes. In contrast to the total diet approach, classification of specific foods as good or bad is overly simplistic and can foster unhealthy eating behaviors. Alternative approaches are necessary in some situations. Eating practices are dynamic and influenced by many factors, including taste and food preferences, weight concerns, physiology, time and convenience, environment, abundance of foods, economics, media/marketing, perceived product safety, culture, and attitudes/beliefs. To increase the effectiveness of nutrition education in promoting sensible food choices, skilled food and nutrition practitioners utilize appropriate behavioral theory and evidence-based strategies. Focusing on variety, moderation, and proportionality in the context of a healthy lifestyle, rather than targeting specific nutrients or foods, can help reduce consumer confusion and prevent unnecessary reliance on supplements. Proactive, empowering, and practical messages that emphasize the total diet approach promote positive lifestyle changes.",0
23349881,"The causal role of the hedgehog pathway in cancer has been best documented in basal cell carcinoma of the skin. To assess potential DNA alterations of the hedgehog pathway in gastric cancer, we sequenced SMO and PTCH1 genes in a set of 39 gastric tumors. Tumors were classified by histology based on the Lauren classification and Sanger sequencing was performed to obtain full length coding sequences. Genomic instability was evident in these tumors as a number of silent or missense mutations were found. In addition to those that are potential germline polymorphisms, we found three SMO missense mutations, and one PTCH1 frameshift mutation that are novel and have not been documented in basal cell carcinoma. Mutations were found in both intestinal and diffuse type gastric tumors as well as in tumors that exhibit both intestinal and diffuse features. mRNA expression of hedgehog pathway genes was also examined and their levels do not indicate unequivocal higher pathway activity in tumors with mutations than those without. In summary, SMO and/or PTCH1 mutations are present at low frequency in different histologic subtypes of gastric tumors and these do not appear to be driver mutations.",1
23337955,"The purpose of this study was to screen differentially expressed genes and             microRNAs in order to find a new target for the accurate diagnosis and effective             therapy of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) at the gene and microRNA levels. The             total RNA of liver tissues was extracted from four groups of patients, ten subjects             each. Microarrays were utilized to detect differentially expressed genes and microRNAs.             According to gene values, significance levels and false discovery rate with a             random variance model, gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes             and Genomes (KEGG) database, node genes and key microRNAs in networks were obtained             and analyzed. A total of 878 differentially expressed genes and 26 microRNAs were             found. In co-expression genetic networks, node genes modulating the network were             Acyl-coenzyme A synthetase-3 (ACSF3), Frizzled-5 (FZD5), LOC727987 and C1orf222.             In microRNA-gene networks, the key microRNAs were hsa-miR-570, hsa-miR-122, hsa-miR-34b,             hsa-miR-29c, hsa-miR-922 and hsa-miR-185, which negatively regulated approximately             79 downstream target genes. In the course of ALD, we found 4 differentially expressed             node genes and analyzed ACSF3 and FZD5. ACSF3 was significantly upregulated, and             was involved in fatty acid and lipid metabolism and accelerated liver injury.             These two genes were involved in fatty acids and lipid metabolism. FZD5 was downregulated             and reduced the synthesis of membrane transport protein in the hepatic membrane             and the membrane stability, and accelerated the liver cell apoptosis process.             Six key microRNAs regulated numerous biological functions such as the immune response,             the inflammatory response and glutathione metabolism. This finding provides valuable             insight into the diagnosis and treatment of ALD.",1
23337944,"Dietary preference for fat may increase risk for obesity. It is a complex behavior regulated in part by the amygdala, a brain structure involved in reward processing and food behavior, and modulated by genetic factors. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to search for gene loci associated with dietary intake of fat, and we tested whether these loci are also associated with adiposity and amygdala volume. We studied 598 adolescents (12-18 years) recruited from the French-Canadian founder population and genotyped them with 530 011 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Fat intake was assessed with a 24-hour food recall. Adiposity was examined with anthropometry and bioimpedance. Amygdala volume was measured by magnetic resonance imaging. GWAS identified a locus of fat intake in the μ-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1, rs2281617, P=5.2 × 10(-6)), which encodes a receptor expressed in the brain-reward system and shown previously to modulate fat preference in animals. The minor OPRM1 allele appeared to have a 'protective' effect: it was associated with lower fat intake (by 4%) and lower body-fat mass (by ∼2 kg, P=0.02). Consistent with the possible amygdala-mediated inhibition of fat preference, this allele was additionally associated with higher amygdala volume (by 69 mm(3), P=0.02) and, in the carriers of this allele, amygdala volume correlated inversely with fat intake (P=0.02). Finally, OPRM1 was associated with fat intake in an independent sample of 490 young adults. In summary, OPRM1 may modulate dietary intake of fat and hence risk for obesity, and this effect may be modulated by subtle variations in the amygdala volume.",1

23317546,"Aminoacylase 1 (ACY1) is a cytosolic enzyme responsible for amino acid deacylation during intracellular protein degradation. ACY1 has been implicated in a number of human tumor types. However, the exact role of ACY1 in tumor development remains elusive because it was found to be lost in small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma but overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC). The present study aims to further clarify the relationship of ACY1 with CRC progression. Immunohistochemical staining was performed in tissue microarrays composed of 120 cases of CRC using a monoclonal anti-ACY1 antibody. Immunoreactivity was analyzed in association with patients' clinicopathologic parameters and survival time. The role of ACY1 in cell proliferation and apoptosis was assessed by silencing its expression in HCT116 cells using a small interfering RNA. Strong expression of ACY1 was found to be significantly associated with more advanced TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, positive vascular invasion, and shorter cancer-specific survival. ACY1 knockdown significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. We concluded that ACY1 expression in CRC varies with stage and appears to play a role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Further evaluation of ACY1 as a clinically useful prognostic marker and a potential drug target for CRC would seem worthwhile.",1

Yet, the potential for drug-vitamin D interactions is rarely considered. This systematic review of the literature was conducted to evaluate the extent to which drugs affect vitamin D status or supplementation alters drug effectiveness or toxicity in humans. Electronic databases were used to identify eligible peer-reviewed studies published through September 1, 2010. Study characteristics and findings were abstracted, and quality was assessed for each study. A total of 109 unique reports met the inclusion criteria. The majority of eligible studies were classified as class C (nonrandomized trials, case-control studies, or time series) or D (cross-sectional, trend, case report/series, or before-and-after studies). Only 2 class C and 3 class D studies were of positive quality. Insufficient evidence was available to determine whether lipase inhibitors, antimicrobial agents, antiepileptic drugs, highly active antiretroviral agents, or H2 receptor antagonists alter serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Atorvastatin appears to increase 25(OH)D concentrations, whereas concurrent vitamin D supplementation decreases concentrations of atorvastatin. Use of thiazide diuretics in combination with calcium and vitamin D supplements may cause hypercalcemia in the elderly or those with compromised renal function or hyperparathyroidism. Larger studies with stronger study designs are needed to clarify potential drug-vitamin D interactions, especially for drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Healthcare providers should be aware of the potential for drug-vitamin D interactions.",0
23285334,"The aim of the present study was to compare two implant surfaces, the TiOblast (Astra Tech) surface, manufactured by blasting the surface and already present in literature and the Osseospeed (Astra Tech) surface, manufactured by blasting and treating the surface with fluoride ions and recently launched onto the market with the modified surfaces of the latest generation. This study is part of a more extensive research project whose protocol required the insertion of 10 couples of implants; thus in the present discussion partial data are being taken into consideration, with an eye at collecting more data in the future, regarding both microscopy and histomorphometric histological analysis on 5 couples of implants. The purpose of the study is to investigate how the modified surfaces of the latest generation can guarantee a greater osseointegration both from a qualitative and quantitative level compared to the surfaces presently used and that they may represent the first example of ""bioactivity"", that is, an active interaction with the processes of new bone formation and tissue healing.",0
23281178,"The study of the genetic regulation of metabolism in human serum samples can contribute to a better understanding of the intermediate biological steps that lead from polymorphism to disease. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to discover metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) utilizing samples from a study of prostate cancer in Swedish men, consisting of 402 individuals (214 cases and 188 controls) in a discovery set and 489 case-only samples in a replication set. A global nontargeted metabolite profiling approach was utilized resulting in the detection of 6,138 molecular features followed by targeted identification of associated metabolites. Seven replicating loci were identified (PYROXD2, FADS1, PON1, CYP4F2, UGT1A8, ACADL, and LIPC) with associated sequence variants contributing significantly to trait variance for one or more metabolites (P = 10(-13) -10(-91)). Regional mQTL enrichment analyses implicated two loci that included FADS1 and a novel locus near PDGFC. Biological pathway analysis implicated ACADM, ACADS, ACAD8, ACAD10, ACAD11, and ACOXL, reflecting significant enrichment of genes with acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. mQTL SNPs and mQTL-harboring genes were over-represented across GWASs conducted to date, suggesting that these data may have utility in tracing the molecular basis of some complex disease associations.",1
23269536,"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a commonly used cancer biomarker for prostate cancer, and is often included as part of routine physical examinations in China. Serum levels of PSA may be influenced by genetic factors as well as other factors. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted in a European population successfully identified six genetic loci that were significantly associated with PSA level. In this study, we aimed to identify common genetic variants that are associated with serum level of PSA in a Chinese population. We also evaluated the effects of those variants by creating personalized PSA cutoff values. A two-stage GWAS of PSA level was performed among men age 20-69 years and self-reported cancer-free participants that underwent routine physical examinations at several hospitals in Guangxi Province, China. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with PSA levels in the first stage of sample (N = 1,999) were confirmed in the second stage of sample (N = 1,496). Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the independent contribution of confirmed SNPs and known covariates, such as age, to the level of PSA. SNPs in three regions were significantly associated with levels of PSA in this two-stage GWAS, and had combined P values between 4.62 × 10(-17) and 6.45 × 10(-37). The three regions are located on 1q32.1 at SLC45A3, 10q11.23 at MSMB, and 19q13.33 at KLK3. The region 1q32.1 at SLC45A3 was identified as a novel locus. Genetic variants contributed significantly more to the variance of PSA level than known covariates such as age. Personalized cutoff values of serum PSA, calculated based on the inheritance of these associated SNPs, differ considerably among individuals. Identification of these genetic markers provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms of PSA. Taking individual variation into account, these genetic variants may improve the performance of PSA to predict prostate cancer.",1
23266802,"The advance of high-throughput experimental technologies generates many gene sets with different biological meanings, where many important insights can only be extracted by identifying the biological (regulatory/functional) features that are distinct between different gene sets (e.g. essential vs. non-essential genes, TATA box-containing vs. TATA box-less genes, induced vs. repressed genes under certain biological conditions). Although many servers have been developed to identify enriched features in a gene set, most of them were designed to analyze one gene set at a time but cannot compare two gene sets. Moreover, the features used in existing servers were mainly focused on functional annotations (GO terms), pathways, transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and/or protein-protein interactions (PPIs). In yeast, various important regulatory features, including promoter bendability, nucleosome occupancy, 5'-UTR length, and TF-gene regulation evidence, are available but have not been used in any enrichment analysis servers. This motivates us to develop the Yeast Genes Analyzer (YGA), a web server that simultaneously analyzes various biological (regulatory/functional) features of two gene sets and performs statistical tests to identify the distinct features between them. Many well-studied gene sets such as essential, stress-response, TATA box-containing and cell cycle genes were pre-compiled in YGA for users, if they have only one gene set, to compare with. In comparison with the existing enrichment analysis servers, YGA tests more comprehensive regulatory features (e.g. promoter bendability, nucleosome occupancy, 5'-UTR length, experimental evidence of TF-gene binding and TF-gene regulation) and functional features (e.g. PPI, GO terms, pathways and functional groups of genes, including essential/non-essential genes, stress-induced/-repressed genes, TATA box-containing/-less genes, occupied/depleted proximal-nucleosome genes and cell cycle genes). Furthermore, YGA uses various statistical tests to provide objective comparison measures. The two major contributions of YGA, comprehensive features and statistical comparison, help to mine important information that cannot be obtained from other servers. The sophisticated analysis tools of YGA can identify distinct biological features between two gene sets, which help biologists to form new hypotheses about the underlying biological mechanisms responsible for the observed difference between these two gene sets. YGA can be accessed from the following web pages: http://cosbi.ee.ncku.edu.tw/yga/ and http://yga.ee.ncku.edu.tw/.",0
23263491,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is caused by the cooperation of multiple oncogenic lesions. We used exome sequencing on 67 T-ALLs to gain insight into the mutational spectrum in these leukemias. We detected protein-altering mutations in 508 genes, with an average of 8.2 mutations in pediatric and 21.0 mutations in adult T-ALL. Using stringent filtering, we predict seven new oncogenic driver genes in T-ALL. We identify CNOT3 as a tumor suppressor mutated in 7 of 89 (7.9%) adult T-ALLs, and its knockdown causes tumors in a sensitized Drosophila melanogaster model. In addition, we identify mutations affecting the ribosomal proteins RPL5 and RPL10 in 12 of 122 (9.8%) pediatric T-ALLs, with recurrent alterations of Arg98 in RPL10. Yeast and lymphoid cells expressing the RPL10 Arg98Ser mutant showed a ribosome biogenesis defect. Our data provide insights into the mutational landscape of pediatric versus adult T-ALL and identify the ribosome as a potential oncogenic factor.",1
23223146,"A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted on 502 French middle-aged Caucasian women to identify genetic factors that may affect skin aging severity. A high-throughput Illumina Human Omni1-Quad beadchip was used. After single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) quality controls, 795,063 SNPs remained for analysis purposes. Possible stratification was first examined using the Eigenstrat method, and then the relationships between genotypes and four skin aging indicators (global photoaging, lentigines, wrinkles, and sagging) were investigated separately by linear regressions adjusted on age, smoking habits, lifetime sun exposure, hormonal status, and the two main Eigen vectors. One signal passed the Bonferroni threshold (P=1.53 × 10(-8)) and was significantly associated with global photoaging. It was also correlated with the wrinkling score and the sagging score. According to HapMap, this SNP, rs322458, was in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with intronic SNPs of the STXBP5L gene, which is expressed in the skin. In addition, it was also in LD with another SNP that increases the expression of the FBXO40 gene in the skin. These two genes, which were not previously described in the context of aging, may constitute good candidates for the investigation of molecular mechanisms of skin photoaging.",1
23213074,"Genetic factors account for a significant proportion of the phenotypic variance of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); however, very few predisposing genes have been identified. We aimed to (1) identify novel genetic associations with NAFLD by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS), and (2) examine the biological expression of the strongest genetic associations in a separate cohort. We performed GWAS of a population-based cohort (Raine Study) of 928 adolescents assessed for NAFLD by ultrasound at age 17. Expression of genes with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were associated with NAFLD at a significance level of P < 10(-5) was examined in adults with NAFLD and controls by quantifying hepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and serum levels of protein. After adjustment for sex and degree of adiposity, SNPs in two genes expressed in liver were associated with NAFLD adolescents: group-specific component (GC) (odds ratio [OR], 2.54; P = 1.20 × 10(-6)) and lymphocyte cytosolic protein-1 (LCP1) (OR, 3.29; P = 2.96 × 10(-6)). SNPs in two genes expressed in neurons were also associated with NAFLD: lipid phosphate phosphatase-related protein type 4 (LPPR4) (OR, 2.30; P = 4.82 × 10(-6)) and solute carrier family 38 member 8 (SLC38A8) (OR, 3.14; P = 1.86 × 10(-6) ). Hepatic GC mRNA was significantly reduced (by 83%) and LCP1 mRNA was increased (by 300%) in liver biopsy samples from patients with NAFLD compared to controls (P < 0.05). Mean serum levels of GC protein were significantly lower in patients with NAFLD than controls (250 ± 90 versus 298 ± 90, respectively; P = 0.004); GC protein levels decreased with increasing severity of hepatic steatosis (P < 0.01).",1
23192594,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of obesity measures have identified associations with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, no large-scale evaluation of gene-environment interactions has been performed. We conducted a search of gene-environment (G × E) interactions in post-menopausal African-American and Hispanic women from the Women's Health Initiative SNP Health Association Resource GWAS study. Single SNP linear regression on body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip circumference ratio (WHR) adjusted for multidimensional-scaling-derived axes of ancestry and age was run in race-stratified data with 871,512 SNPs available from African-Americans (N = 8,203) and 786,776 SNPs from Hispanics (N = 3,484). Tests of G × E interaction at all SNPs for recreational physical activity (m h/week), dietary energy intake (kcal/day), alcohol intake (categorical), cigarette smoking years, and cigarette smoking (ever vs. never) were run in African-Americans and Hispanics adjusted for ancestry and age at interview, followed by meta-analysis of G × E interaction terms. The strongest evidence for concordant G × E interactions in African-Americans and Hispanics was for smoking and marker rs10133840 (Q statistic P = 0.70, beta = -0.01, P = 3.81 × 10(-7)) with BMI as the outcome. The strongest evidence for G × E interaction within a cohort was in African-Americans with WHR as outcome for dietary energy intake and rs9557704 (SNP × kcal = -0.04, P = 2.17 × 10(-7)). No results exceeded the Bonferroni-corrected statistical significance threshold.",1
23180792,"Gene families often show degrees of differences in terms of exon-intron structures depending on their distinct evolutionary histories. Comparative analysis of gene structures is important for understanding their evolutionary and functional relationships within plant species. Here, we present a comparative genomics database named PIECE (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/piece) for Plant Intron and Exon Comparison and Evolution studies. The database contains all the annotated genes extracted from 25 sequenced plant genomes. These genes were classified based on Pfam motifs. Phylogenetic trees were pre-constructed for each gene category. PIECE provides a user-friendly interface for different types of searches and a graphical viewer for displaying a gene structure pattern diagram linked to the resulting bootstrapped dendrogram for each gene family. The gene structure evolution of orthologous gene groups was determined using the GLOOME, Exalign and GECA software programs that can be accessed within the database. PIECE also provides a web server version of the software, GSDraw, for drawing schematic diagrams of gene structures. PIECE is a powerful tool for comparing gene sequences and provides valuable insights into the evolution of gene structure in plant genomes.",0
23180791,"The concept of orthology provides a foundation for formulating hypotheses on gene and genome evolution, and thus forms the cornerstone of comparative genomics, phylogenomics and metagenomics. We present the update of OrthoDB-the hierarchical catalog of orthologs (http://www.orthodb.org). From its conception, OrthoDB promoted delineation of orthologs at varying resolution by explicitly referring to the hierarchy of species radiations, now also adopted by other resources. The current release provides comprehensive coverage of animals and fungi representing 252 eukaryotic species, and is now extended to prokaryotes with the inclusion of 1115 bacteria. Functional annotations of orthologous groups are provided through mapping to InterPro, GO, OMIM and model organism phenotypes, with cross-references to major resources including UniProt, NCBI and FlyBase. Uniquely, OrthoDB provides computed evolutionary traits of orthologs, such as gene duplicability and loss profiles, divergence rates, sibling groups, and now extended with exon-intron architectures, syntenic orthologs and parent-child trees. The interactive web interface allows navigation along the species phylogenies, complex queries with various identifiers, annotation keywords and phrases, as well as with gene copy-number profiles and sequence homology searches. With the explosive growth of available data, OrthoDB also provides mapping of newly sequenced genomes and transcriptomes to the current orthologous groups.",0

23146407,"Chondrosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that is often resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We applied high resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization to 46 tumor specimens from 44 patients with chondrosarcoma and identified several genes with potential importance for the development of chondrosarcoma. Several homozygous deletions were detected. The tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A and MTAP were each homozygously deleted in four of the cases, and the RB1 gene was homozygously deleted in one. Two homozygous deletions of MTAP did not affect CDKN2A. Deletions were also found to affect genes of the cadherin family, including CDH4 and CDH7, each of which had a targeted homozygous loss in one case, and CDH19, which had a targeted homozygous loss in two cases. Loss of the EXT1 and EXT2 genes was uncommon; EXT1 was homozygously deleted in none and EXT2 in two of the cases, and large heterozygous losses including EXT1 and/or EXT2 were seen in three cases. Targeted gains and amplifications affected the MYC, E2F3, CDK6, PDGFRA, KIT, and PDGFD genes in one case each. The data indicate that chondrosarcomas develop through a combination of genomic imbalances that often affect the RB1 signaling pathway. The inactivation of cadherin genes may also be critical in the pathogenesis of the tumor.",1
23133399,"Hereditary hypertrichoses are a group of hair overgrowth syndromes that are extremely rare in humans. We have previously demonstrated that a position effect on TRPS1 is associated with hypertrichosis in humans and mice. To gain insight into the functional role of Trps1, we analyzed the late morphogenesis vibrissae phenotype of Trps1(Δgt) mutant mice, which is characterized by follicle degeneration after peg downgrowth has been initiated. We found that Trps1 directly represses expression of the hair follicle stem cell regulator Sox9 to control proliferation of the follicle epithelium. Furthermore, we identified a copy number variation upstream of SOX9 in a family with hypertrichosis that significantly decreases expression of the gene in the hair follicle, providing new insights into the long-range regulation of SOX9. Our findings uncover a novel transcriptional hierarchy that regulates epithelial proliferation in the developing hair follicle and contributes to the pathology of hypertrichosis.",1
23127916,"The two basic mainstays of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) treatment are surgery and imatinib, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that allows achieving a stable or responding disease in about 80% of patients with unresectable/metastatic GIST. Response to imatinib mainly depends from KIT and PDGFRα mutational status. Nevertheless, some patients with a potentially responsive genotype do not respond, and others develop a pattern of resistance to imatinib which is not associated with secondary mutations. This emphasizes the presence of mechanisms of resistance other than the receptor-related genotype, and the need of biological predictors to select the optimal therapeutic strategy, particularly now that other potent inhibitors are available. We investigated a panel of 31 polymorphisms in 11 genes, potentially associated with the pharmacogenetics of imatinib, in a group of 54 unresectable/metastatic GISTs treated with imatinib 400mg daily as first line therapy. Included in this analysis were polymorphisms in the transporters' family SLC22, SLCO, ABC, and in the metabolizing genes CYP-3A4 and -3A5. Time to progression was significantly improved in presence of the C allele in SLC22A4 (OCTN1 rs1050152), and the two minor alleles (G) in SLC22A5 (OCTN2 rs2631367 and rs2631372). Importantly, multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, gender, KIT/PDGFRα mutational status, and tumour size, revealed that all the three genotypes maintained independent predictive significance. In conclusion, in this study we showed that SLC22A4 and SLC22A5 genotypes may be an important predictor of time to progression in GIST patients receiving imatinib therapy. Further investigations are required in an attempt to further personalize GIST therapy.",1
23122588,"Microphthalmia with linear skin lesions (MLS) is an X-linked dominant male-lethal disorder associated with mutations in holocytochrome c-type synthase (HCCS), which encodes a crucial player of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC). Unlike other mitochondrial diseases, MLS is characterized by a well-recognizable neurodevelopmental phenotype. Interestingly, not all clinically diagnosed MLS cases have mutations in HCCS, thus suggesting genetic heterogeneity for this disorder. Among the possible candidates, we analyzed the X-linked COX7B and found deleterious de novo mutations in two simplex cases and a nonsense mutation, which segregates with the disease, in a familial case. COX7B encodes a poorly characterized structural subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the MRC complex IV. We demonstrated that COX7B is indispensable for COX assembly, COX activity, and mitochondrial respiration. Downregulation of the COX7B ortholog (cox7B) in medaka (Oryzias latipes) resulted in microcephaly and microphthalmia that recapitulated the MLS phenotype and demonstrated an essential function of complex IV activity in vertebrate CNS development. Our results indicate an evolutionary conserved role of the MRC complexes III and IV for the proper development of the CNS in vertebrates and uncover a group of mitochondrial diseases hallmarked by a developmental phenotype.",1
23093189,"In complex multicellular eukaryotes such as animals and plants, horizontal gene transfer is commonly considered rare with very limited evolutionary significance. Here we show that horizontal gene transfer is a dynamic process occurring frequently in the early evolution of land plants. Our genome analyses of the moss Physcomitrella patens identified 57 families of nuclear genes that were acquired from prokaryotes, fungi or viruses. Many of these gene families were transferred to the ancestors of green or land plants. Available experimental evidence shows that these anciently acquired genes are involved in some essential or plant-specific activities such as xylem formation, plant defence, nitrogen recycling as well as the biosynthesis of starch, polyamines, hormones and glutathione. These findings suggest that horizontal gene transfer had a critical role in the transition of plants from aquatic to terrestrial environments. On the basis of these findings, we propose a model of horizontal gene transfer mechanism in nonvascular and seedless vascular plants.",0
23091298,"To ascertain the genetic basis of pediatric Burkitt lymphoma (pBL), we performed clinical-grade next-generation sequencing of 182 cancer-related genes on 29 formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded primary pBL samples. Ninety percent of cases had at least one mutation or genetic alteration, most commonly involving MYC and TP53. EBV(-) cases were more likely than EBV(+) cases to have multiple mutations (P < .0001). Alterations in tumor-related genes not previously described in BL were identified. Truncating mutations in ARID1A, a member of the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex, were seen in 17% of cases. MCL1 pathway alterations were found in 22% of cases and confirmed in an expanded panel. Other clinically relevant genomic alterations were found in 20% of cases. Our data suggest the roles of MCL1 and ARID1A in BL pathogenesis and demonstrate that comprehensive genomic profiling may identify additional treatment options in refractory disease.",1
23076869,"FAT1, FAT2, FAT3 and FAT4 are human homologs of Drosophila Fat, which is             involved in tumor suppression and planar cell polarity (PCP). FAT1 and FAT4 undergo             the first proteolytic cleavage by Furin and are predicted to undergo the second             cleavage by γ‑secretase to release intracellular domain (ICD). Ena/VAPS‑binding             to FAT1 induces actin polymerization at lamellipodia and filopodia to promote             cell migration, while Scribble‑binding to FAT1 induces phosphorylation and functional             inhibition of YAP1 to suppress cell growth. FAT1 is repressed in oral cancer owing             to homozygous deletion or epigenetic silencing and is preferentially downregulated             in invasive breast cancer. On the other hand, FAT1 is upregulated in leukemia             and prognosis of preB‑ALL patients with FAT1 upregulation is poor. FAT4 directly             interacts with MPDZ/MUPP1 to recruit membrane‑associated guanylate kinase MPP5/PALS1.             FAT4 is involved in the maintenance of PCP and inhibition of cell proliferation.             FAT4 mRNA is repressed in breast cancer and lung cancer due to promoter hypermethylation.             FAT4 gene is recurrently mutated in several types of human cancers, such as melanoma,             pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. FAT1 and FAT4             suppress tumor growth via activation of Hippo signaling, whereas FAT1 promotes             tumor migration via induction of actin polymerization. FAT1 is tumor suppressive             or oncogenic in a context‑dependent manner, while FAT4 is tumor suppressive. Copy             number aberration, translocation and point mutation of FAT1, FAT2, FAT3, FAT4,             FRMD1, FRMD6, NF2, WWC1, WWC2, SAV1, STK3, STK4, MOB1A, MOB1B, LATS1, LATS2, YAP1             and WWTR1/TAZ genes should be comprehensively investigated in various types of             human cancers to elucidate the mutation landscape of the FAT‑Hippo signaling cascades.             Because YAP1 and WWTR1 are located at the crossroads of adhesion, GPCR, RTK and             stem‑cell signaling network, cancer genomics of the FAT signaling cascades could             be applied for diagnostics, prognostics and therapeutics in the era of personalized             medicine.",1

On the basis of data from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a validation study comprising a total of 3,328 subjects with atopic dermatitis and 14,992 controls in the Japanese population, we report here 8 new susceptibility loci: IL1RL1-IL18R1-IL18RAP (P(combined) = 8.36 × 10(-18)), the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region (P = 8.38 × 10(-20)), OR10A3-NLRP10 (P = 1.54 × 10(-22)), GLB1 (P = 2.77 × 10(-16)), CCDC80 (P = 1.56 × 10(-19)), CARD11 (P = 7.83 × 10(-9)), ZNF365 (P = 5.85 × 10(-20)) and CYP24A1-PFDN4 (P = 1.65 × 10(-8)). We also replicated the associations of the FLG, C11orf30, TMEM232-SLC25A46, TNFRSF6B-ZGPAT, OVOL1, ACTL9 and KIF3A-IL13 loci that were previously reported in GWAS of European and Chinese individuals and a meta-analysis of GWAS for atopic dermatitis.

23040494,"About half of people with trisomy 21 have a congenital heart defect (CHD), whereas the remainder have a structurally normal heart, demonstrating that trisomy 21 is a significant risk factor but is not causal for abnormal heart development. Atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD) are the most commonly occurring heart defects in Down syndrome (DS), and ∼65% of all AVSD is associated with DS. We used a candidate-gene approach among individuals with DS and complete AVSD (cases = 141) and DS with no CHD (controls = 141) to determine whether rare genetic variants in genes involved in atrioventricular valvuloseptal morphogenesis contribute to AVSD in this sensitized population. We found a significant excess (p < 0.0001) of variants predicted to be deleterious in cases compared to controls. At the most stringent level of filtering, we found potentially damaging variants in nearly 20% of cases but fewer than 3% of controls. The variants with the highest probability of being damaging in cases only were found in six genes: COL6A1, COL6A2, CRELD1, FBLN2, FRZB, and GATA5. Several of the case-specific variants were recurrent in unrelated individuals, occurring in 10% of cases studied. No variants with an equal probability of being damaging were found in controls, demonstrating a highly specific association with AVSD. Of note, all of these genes are in the VEGF-A pathway, even though the candidate genes analyzed in this study represented numerous biochemical and developmental pathways, suggesting that rare variants in the VEGF-A pathway might contribute to the genetic underpinnings of AVSD in humans.",1

22990015,"Pediatric stroke is a rare but highly penetrant disease with a strong genetic background. Although there are an increasing number of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for stroke in adults, such studies for stroke of pediatric onset are lacking. Here we report the results of the first GWAS on pediatric stroke using a large cohort of 270 family-based trios. GWAS was performed using the Illumina 370 CNV single nucleotide polymorphisms array and analyzed using the transmission disequilibrium test as implemented in PLINK. An enrichment analysis was performed to identify additional true association signals among lower P value signals and searched for cumulatively associated genes within protein interaction data using dmGWAS. We observed clustering of association signals in 4 genes belonging to one family of metalloproteinases at high (ADAMTS12, P = 2.9 × 10(-6); ADAMTS2, P = 8.0 × 10(-6)) and moderate (ADAMTS13, P = 9.3 × 10(-4); ADAMTS17, P = 8.5 × 10(-4)) significance levels. Over-representation and gene-network analyses highlight the importance of the extracellular matrix in conjunction with members of the phosphoinositide and calcium signaling pathways in the susceptibility for pediatric stroke. Associated extracellular matrix components, such as ADAMTS proteins, in combination with misbalanced coagulation signals as unveiled by gene network analysis suggest a major role of postnatal vascular injury with subsequent thrombus formation as the leading cause of pediatric stroke.",1
22985999,"This paper extends the classical result of Fisher (1937) from the case of two alleles to the case of multiple alleles. Consider a population living in a homogeneous one-dimensional infinite habitat. Individuals in this population carry a gene that occurs in k forms, called alleles. Under the joint action of migration and selection and some additional conditions, the frequencies of the alleles, p(i),i=1,…,k, satisfy a system of differential equations of the form (1.2). In this paper, we first show that under the conditions A(1)A(1) is the most fit among the homozygotes, (1.2) is cooperative, the state that only allele A(1) is present in the population is stable, and the state that allele A(1) is absent and all other alleles are present in the population is unstable, then there exists a positive constant, c(*), such that allele A(1) propagates asymptotically with speed c(*) in the population as t→∞. We then show that traveling wave solutions connecting these two states exist for |c|≥c(*). Finally, we show that under certain additional conditions, there exists an explicit formula for c(*). These results allow us to estimate how fast an advantageous gene propagates in a population under selection and migration forces as t→∞. Selection is one of the major evolutionary forces and understanding how it works will help predict the genetic makeup of a population in the long run.",0
22981920,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in children with striking persistence into adulthood and a high co-morbidity with other psychiatric disorders, including personality disorders (PD). The 4p15.31 region was shown to be associated with ADHD in several genome wide association studies (GWAS). In the present study we also report association of the 4p15.31 locus with Cluster B and Cluster C PD as identified by a pooled genome-wide association study in 400 individuals suffering from PD. The gene coding for the Kv channel-interacting protein 4 (KCNIP4) is located in this region. KCNIP4 is an interaction partner of presenilin and plays a role in a negative feedback loop in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Thus, we reasoned it to be a promising candidate gene for ADHD as well as for PD. To clarify the role of KCNIP4 in those disorders, we conducted candidate gene based association studies in 594 patients suffering from adult ADHD and 630 PD patients as compared to 974 healthy control individuals. In the adult ADHD sample, six single markers and one haplotype block revealed to be associated with disease (p values from 0.0079 to 0.049). Seven markers within the KCNIP4 gene showed an association with PD (p values from 0.0043 to 0.0437). The results of these studies suggest a role of KCNIP4 in the etiology of ADHD, PD and other co-morbid disorders.",1
22962453,"One of the difficulties in metagenomic assembly is that homologous genes from evolutionarily closely related species may behave like repeats and confuse assemblers. As a result, small contigs, each representing a short gene fragment, instead of complete genes, may be reported by an assembler. This further complicates annotation of metagenomic datasets, as annotation tools (such as gene predictors or similarity search tools) typically perform poorly on configs encoding short gene fragments.",0
22960999,"We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a genome-wide gene-environment interaction analysis of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) in 2,031 affected individuals (cases) and 2,044 controls with independent validation in 8,092 cases and 8,620 controls. We identified nine new ESCC susceptibility loci, of which seven, at chromosomes 4q23, 16q12.1, 17q21, 22q12, 3q27, 17p13 and 18p11, had a significant marginal effect (P=1.78×10(-39) to P=2.49×10(-11)) and two of which, at 2q22 and 13q33, had a significant association only in the gene-alcohol drinking interaction (gene-environment interaction P (PG×E)=4.39×10(-11) and PG×E=4.80×10(-8), respectively). Variants at the 4q23 locus, which includes the ADH cluster, each had a significant interaction with alcohol drinking in their association with ESCC risk (PG×E=2.54×10(-7) to PG×E=3.23×10(-2)). We confirmed the known association of the ALDH2 locus on 12q24 to ESCC, and a joint analysis showed that drinkers with both of the ADH1B and ALDH2 risk alleles had a fourfold increased risk for ESCC compared to drinkers without these risk alleles. Our results underscore the direct genetic contribution to ESCC risk, as well as the genetic contribution to ESCC through interaction with alcohol consumption.",1
22941191,"Neuroblastoma is a cancer of the sympathetic nervous system that accounts for approximately 10% of all pediatric oncology deaths. Here, we report a genome-wide association study of 2,817 neuroblastoma cases and 7,473 controls. We identified two new associations at 6q16, the first within HACE1 (rs4336470; combined P=2.7×10(-11); odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.35) and the second within LIN28B (rs17065417; combined P=1.2×10(-8); odds ratio 1.38, 95% CI 1.23-1.54). Expression of LIN28B and let-7 miRNA correlated with rs17065417 genotype in neuroblastoma cell lines, and we observed significant growth inhibition upon depletion of LIN28B, specifically in neuroblastoma cells that were homozygous for the risk allele. Low HACE1 and high LIN28B expression in diagnostic primary neuroblastomas were associated with worse overall survival (P=0.008 and 0.014, respectively). Taken together, these data show that common variants in HACE1 and LIN28B influence neuroblastoma susceptibility and indicate that both genes likely have a role in disease progression.",1
22912864,"BRAF(V600) inhibitors have offered a new gateway for better treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, the overall efficacy of BRAF(V600) inhibitors has been lower than expected in clinical trials, and many patients have shown resistance to the drug's effect. We hypothesized that somatic mutations in the Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K) pathway, which promotes proliferation and survival, may coincide with BRAF(V600) mutations and contribute to chemotherapeutic resistance.",1
22912701,"Acute myeloid leukemia patients with normal cytogenetics (CN-AML) account for almost half of AML cases. We aimed to study the frequency and relationship of a wide range of genes previously reported as mutated in AML (ASXL1, NPM1, FLT3, TET2, IDH1/2, RUNX1, DNMT3A, NRAS, JAK2, WT1, CBL, SF3B1, TP53, KRAS and MPL) in a series of 84 CN-AML cases. The most frequently mutated genes in primary cases were NPM1 (60.8%) and FLT3 (50.0%), and in secondary cases ASXL1 (48.5%) and TET2 (30.3%). We showed that 85% of CN-AML patients have mutations in at least one of ASXL1, NPM1, FLT3, TET2, IDH1/2 and/or RUNX1. Serial samples from 19 MDS/CMML cases that progressed to AML were analyzed for ASXL1/TET2/IDH1/2 mutations; seventeen cases presented mutations of at least one of these genes. However, there was no consistent pattern in mutation acquisition during disease progression. This report concerns the analysis of the largest number of gene mutations in CN-AML studied to date, and provides insight into the mutational profile of CN-AML.",1
22881374,"To identify novel late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) risk genes, we have analysed Amish populations of Ohio and Indiana. We performed genome-wide SNP linkage and association studies on 798 individuals (109 with LOAD). We tested association using the Modified Quasi-Likelihood Score test and also performed two-point and multipoint linkage analyses. We found that LOAD was significantly associated with APOE (P= 9.0 × 10-6) in all our ascertainment regions except for the Adams County, Indiana, community (P= 0.55). Genome-wide, the most strongly associated SNP was rs12361953 (P= 7.92 × 10-7). A very strong, genome-wide significant multipoint peak [recessive heterogeneity multipoint LOD (HLOD) = 6.14, dominant HLOD = 6.05] was detected on 2p12. Three additional loci with multipoint HLOD scores >3 were detected on 3q26, 9q31 and 18p11. Converging linkage and association results, the most significantly associated SNP under the 2p12 peak was at rs2974151 (P= 1.29 × 10-4). This SNP is located in CTNNA2, which encodes catenin alpha 2, a neuronal-specific catenin known to have function in the developing brain. These results identify CTNNA2 as a novel candidate LOAD gene, and implicate three other regions of the genome as novel LOAD loci. These results underscore the utility of using family-based linkage and association analyses in isolated populations to identify novel loci for traits with complex genetic architecture.",1
22869035,"We describe the results of the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) performed using trauma-exposed white non-Hispanic participants from a cohort of veterans and their intimate partners (295 cases and 196 controls). Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) yielded evidence of association. One SNP (rs8042149), located in the retinoid-related orphan receptor alpha gene (RORA), reached genome-wide significance. Nominally significant associations were observed for other RORA SNPs in two African-American replication samples-one from the veteran cohort (43 cases and 41 controls) and another independent cohort (100 cases and 421 controls). However, only the associated SNP from the veteran African-American replication sample survived gene-level multiple-testing correction. RORA has been implicated in prior GWAS studies of psychiatric disorders and is known to have an important role in neuroprotection and other behaviorally relevant processes. This study represents an important step toward identifying the genetic underpinnings of PTSD.",1
22864923,"IgA is an important factor in our immune system. There are many diseases associated with it, such as IgA nephropathy, IgA deficiency, and so on. In order to describe the relationship between the genes and the IgA level, we performed a genome-wide association study of serum IgA with 1,999 healthy Chinese men in the first stage and replicated on an independent Chinese sample with 1,496 subjects in the second stage. Association between each SNP with IgA was estimated by multivariate linear regression analysis conditioned on age and smoke. Haplotype analysis for the block around the top SNP was performed. In the first stage, one genomic locus was identified to be significantly associated with IgA. The loci is TNFSF13 (17p13.1; rs3803800; P = 6.26 × 10(-8)). In smoke-specific analysis, rs3803800 was approximately significantly associated with IgA levels in smokers (P = 3.96 × 10(-7)), while no association was observed in nonsmokers (P = 2.28 × 10(-1)). In addition, we performed the haplotype analysis on chromosome 17 with the SNPs around rs3803800. Although the total P value for the haplotype did not acquire significant difference, three haplotypes (TGAG, CACG, and CACA) reached significant (P < 0.05). In conclusion, TNFSF13 could be a susceptible gene which was discovered having relationship with serum IgA level, and smoke might be a factor infecting the IgA level.",1
22856363,"As the amygdala is part of the phylogenetic old brain, and its anatomical and functional properties are conserved across species, it is reasonable to assume genetic influence on its activity. A large corpus of candidate gene studies indicate that individual differences in amygdala activity may be caused by genetic variants within monoaminergic signaling pathways such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. However, to our knowledge, the use of genome-wide data to discover genetic variants underlying individual differences in adult amygdala activity is novel. In the present study, the combination of genome-wide data and functional imaging phenotypes from an emotional faces task yielded a significant association between rs10014254 and the amygdala using a region of interest approach. This single nucleotide polymorphism is located in a regulatory region upstream of the Paired-like homeobox 2b (PHOX2B) gene; therefore it could affect the expression of this gene. PHOX2B regulates the expression of enzymes necessary for the synthesis of several monoamines and is essential for the development of the autonomic nervous system. However, an attempt to replicate the finding in an independent sample from North America did not succeed. The synthesis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and genome-wide data takes a hypothesis-free approach as to which genetic variants are of interest. Therefore, we believe that an undirected finding within such a plausible region is of interest, and that our results add further support to the hypothesis that monoaminergic signaling pathways play a central role in regulating amygdala activity.",1
22855598,"Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are aggressive malignancies of mature T lymphocytes with 5-year overall survival rates of only ∼ 35%. Improvement in outcomes has been stymied by poor understanding of the genetics and molecular pathogenesis of PTCL, with a resulting paucity of molecular targets for therapy. We developed bioinformatic tools to identify chromosomal rearrangements using genome-wide, next-generation sequencing analysis of mate-pair DNA libraries and applied these tools to 16 PTCL patient tissue samples and 6 PTCL cell lines. Thirteen recurrent abnormalities were identified, of which 5 involved p53-related genes (TP53, TP63, CDKN2A, WWOX, and ANKRD11). Among these abnormalities were novel TP63 rearrangements encoding fusion proteins homologous to ΔNp63, a dominant-negative p63 isoform that inhibits the p53 pathway. TP63 rearrangements were seen in 11 (5.8%) of 190 PTCLs and were associated with inferior overall survival; they also were detected in 2 (1.2%) of 164 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. As TP53 mutations are rare in PTCL compared with other malignancies, our findings suggest that a constellation of alternate genetic abnormalities may contribute to disruption of p53-associated tumor suppressor function in PTCL.",1

22847936,"Numerous software applications exist to deal with synthetic gene design, granting the field of heterologous expression a significant support. However, their dispersion requires the access to different tools and online services in order to complete one single project. Analyzing codon usage, calculating codon adaptation index (CAI), aligning orthologs and optimizing genes are just a few examples. A software application, EuGene, was developed for the optimization of multiple gene synthetic design algorithms. In a seamless automatic form, EuGene calculates or retrieves genome data on codon usage (relative synonymous codon usage and CAI), codon context (CPS and codon pair bias), GC content, hidden stop codons, repetitions, deleterious sites, protein primary, secondary and tertiary structures, gene orthologs, species housekeeping genes, performs alignments and identifies genes and genomes. The main function of EuGene is analyzing and redesigning gene sequences using multi-objective optimization techniques that maximize the coding features of the resulting sequence.",0

This research approach is increasingly used to study adaptation, estimate evolutionary parameters, and test diverse evolutionary hypotheses. Long applied in vaccine development, experimental evolution also finds new applications in biotechnology. Recent technological developments provide a path towards detailed understanding of the genomic and molecular basis of experimental evolutionary change, while new findings raise new questions that can be addressed with this approach. However, experimental evolution has important limitations, and the interpretation of results is subject to caveats resulting from small population sizes, limited timescales, the simplified nature of laboratory environments, and, in some cases, the potential to misinterpret the selective forces and other processes at work.",0

Recently, mutations were reported in WTX at Xq11.1 in Wilms' tumors. This study investigated the mutation proportion, type, and distribution in WTX and WT1 in children with Wilms' tumor. The role of WTX/WT1 in the development of Wilms' tumor, and the relationship between clinical phenotype and genotype, were also studied.",1
22797072,"Ovarian granulosa cell tumors (OGCT) are the most frequent kind of sex cord-stromal tumors, and represent ∼2-5% of all ovarian malignancies. OGCTs exist as two entities, juvenile and adult types, with specific clinical and pathological characteristics. The molecular pathogenesis of these tumors has just begun to be unraveled. Indeed, recent studies have indicated that mutation and/or misregulation of the key ovarian transcription factor FOXL2 has a role in OGCT formation, although the mechanisms remain unclear. To better understand the molecular characteristics of OGCT, we studied the transcriptomic profiles of ten human adult-type OGCT samples, as well as ethnically matched granulosa cell (GC) controls. We find that the OGCT samples analyzed herein exhibit several hallmarks of cancer, including increased expression of genes linked to cell proliferation, but decreased expression of those conferring sensitivity to cell death. Moreover, genes differentially expressed in OGCTs are significantly enriched for known FOXL2 target genes, consistently with the prevalence of FOXL2 somatic mutation in these tumors. Expression of these targets is altered in a way expected to promote malignant transformation, for instance, through induction of genes associated with faster cell cycling and downregulation of genes associated with cell death. Over time, such defects may be responsible at least partly for the malignant transformation of healthy GCs into OGCT. These insights into the molecular pathogenesis of OGCTs may open the way to new efforts in the development of more targeted therapeutic strategies for OGCT patients.",1
22792082,"Bronchodilator response (BDR) is an important asthma phenotype that measures reversibility of airway obstruction by comparing lung function (i.e. FEV(1)) before and after the administration of a short-acting β(2)-agonist, the most common rescue medications used for the treatment of asthma. BDR also serves as a test of β(2)-agonist efficacy. BDR is a complex trait that is partly under genetic control. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BDR, quantified as percent change in baseline FEV(1) after administration of a β(2)-agonist, was performed with 1,644 non-Hispanic white asthmatic subjects from six drug clinical trials: CAMP, LOCCS, LODO, a medication trial conducted by Sepracor, CARE, and ACRN. Data for 469,884 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to measure the association of SNPs with BDR using a linear regression model, while adjusting for age, sex, and height. Replication of primary P-values was attempted in 501 white subjects from SARP and 550 white subjects from DAG. Experimental evidence supporting the top gene was obtained via siRNA knockdown and Western blotting analyses. The lowest overall combined P-value was 9.7E-07 for SNP rs295137, near the SPATS2L gene. Among subjects in the primary analysis, those with rs295137 TT genotype had a median BDR of 16.0 (IQR = [6.2, 32.4]), while those with CC or TC genotypes had a median BDR of 10.9 (IQR = [5.0, 22.2]). SPATS2L mRNA knockdown resulted in increased β(2)-adrenergic receptor levels. Our results suggest that SPATS2L may be an important regulator of β(2)-adrenergic receptor down-regulation and that there is promise in gaining a better understanding of the biological mechanisms of differential response to β(2)-agonists through GWAS.",1

22744181,"Lean body mass (LBM) and age at menarche (AAM) are two important complex traits for human health. The aim of this study was to identify pleiotropic genes for both traits using a powerful bivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS). Two studies, a discovery study and a replication study, were performed. In the discovery study, 909622 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 801 unrelated female Han Chinese subjects using the Affymetrix human genome-wide SNP array 6.0 platform. Then, a bivariate GWAS was performed to identify the SNPs that may be important for LBM and AAM. In the replication study, significant findings from the discovery study were validated in 1692 unrelated Caucasian female subjects. One SNP rs3027009 that was bivariately associated with left arm lean mass and AAM in the discovery samples (P=7.26×10(-6)) and in the replication samples (P=0.005) was identified. The SNP is located at the upstream of DARC (Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines) gene, suggesting that DARC may play an important role in regulating the metabolisms of both LBM and AAM.",1
22736493,"EML4-ALK fusion genes have been recognized as novel ""driver mutations"" in a small subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). The frequency of EML4-ALK fusions in NSCLC patients who have clinical characteristics related to EGFR mutation remains unknown. We screened 102 Chinese patients with NSCLC based on one or more of the following characteristics: female, no or light smoking history, and adenocarcinoma histology. EML4-ALK fusion genes were identified by RT-PCR, whereas EGFR (Exons 18-21) and KRAS (Exons 1 and 2) mutations were detected by DNA sequencing. Eight specimens (8%) were positive for EML4-ALK fusions, with seven being Variant 1 and one Variant 2. There were 44 (43%) and 17 (16%) patients harboring EGFR and KRAS mutations, respectively. Thirty-one (31%) cases were wild type for EML4-ALK, EGFR, and KRAS mutations. Of the eight patients with EML4-ALK, none had an EGFR mutation, whereas a KRAS mutation was detected in one patient. Histologically, five of the EML4-ALK positive tumors were adenocarcinoma and two were mixed adenosquamous carcinoma; only one was a squamous carcinoma. Our data support the conclusion that the EML4-ALK fusion gene defines a new molecular subset of NSCLC with distinct pathologic features.",1
22732460,"Health literacy is defined as the degree to which individuals obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make informed health decisions. Health literacy is a stronger predictor of health than age, income, employment, education, and race. Although the field has grown during the past decade, most health literacy research does not explicitly focus on food or nutrition, and dietetics practitioners often remain unaware of patients' health literacy level. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the literature on nutrition and health literacy to enhance dietetics practitioners' awareness of the importance of health literacy in practice and research. Of the 33 studies reviewed, four focused on measurement development, 16 on readability assessments, and 13 on individual literacy skills assessments. Collective evaluation revealed four noteworthy gaps, including the need to use more comprehensive assessment approaches that move beyond readability and numeracy to address the full spectrum of health literacy factors; the need to apply more robust experimental studies to examine the effectiveness of health literacy interventions among individuals, communities, health care providers, and health care systems; the need to explore the moderating and mediating roles of an individual's health literacy status on nutrition outcomes; and the need to examine long-term effects of health literacy interventions on nutrition outcomes. This article defines health literacy gaps and opportunities in nutrition research and practice, and calls for continued action to elevate the role of dietetics practitioners in addressing health literacy.",0
22722201,"All cancers carry somatic mutations in their genomes. A subset, known as driver mutations, confer clonal selective advantage on cancer cells and are causally implicated in oncogenesis, and the remainder are passenger mutations. The driver mutations and mutational processes operative in breast cancer have not yet been comprehensively explored. Here we examine the genomes of 100 tumours for somatic copy number changes and mutations in the coding exons of protein-coding genes. The number of somatic mutations varied markedly between individual tumours. We found strong correlations between mutation number, age at which cancer was diagnosed and cancer histological grade, and observed multiple mutational signatures, including one present in about ten per cent of tumours characterized by numerous mutations of cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. Driver mutations were identified in several new cancer genes including AKT2, ARID1B, CASP8, CDKN1B, MAP3K1, MAP3K13, NCOR1, SMARCD1 and TBX3. Among the 100 tumours, we found driver mutations in at least 40 cancer genes and 73 different combinations of mutated cancer genes. The results highlight the substantial genetic diversity underlying this common disease.",1

22719841,"MYB proteins comprise a large family of plant transcription factors, members of which perform a variety of functions in plant biological processes. To date, no genome-wide characterization of this gene family has been conducted in maize (Zea mays). In the present study, we performed a comprehensive computational analysis, to yield a complete overview of the R2R3-MYB gene family in maize, including the phylogeny, expression patterns, and also its structural and functional characteristics. The MYB gene structure in maize and Arabidopsis were highly conserved, indicating that they were originally compact in size. Subgroup-specific conserved motifs outside the MYB domain may reflect functional conservation. The genome distribution strongly supports the hypothesis that segmental and tandem duplication contribute to the expansion of maize MYB genes. We also performed an updated and comprehensive classification of the R2R3-MYB gene families in maize and other plant species. The result revealed that the functions were conserved between maize MYB genes and their putative orthologs, demonstrating the origin and evolutionary diversification of plant MYB genes. Species-specific groups/subgroups may evolve or be lost during evolution, resulting in functional divergence. Expression profile study indicated that maize R2R3-MYB genes exhibit a variety of expression patterns, suggesting diverse functions. Furthermore, computational prediction potential targets of maize microRNAs (miRNAs) revealed that miR159, miR319, and miR160 may be implicated in regulating maize R2R3-MYB genes, suggesting roles of these miRNAs in post-transcriptional regulation and transcription networks. Our comparative analysis of R2R3-MYB genes in maize confirm and extend the sequence and functional characteristics of this gene family, and will facilitate future functional analysis of the MYB gene family in maize.",0
22703881,"Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT) are clinical tests commonly used to screen for coagulation-factor deficiencies. One genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been reported previously for aPTT, but no GWAS has been reported for PT. We conducted a GWAS and meta-analysis to identify genetic loci for aPTT and PT. The GWAS for aPTT was conducted in 9,240 individuals of European ancestry from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, and the GWAS for PT was conducted in 2,583 participants from the Genetic Study of Three Population Microisolates in South Tyrol (MICROS) and the Lothian Birth Cohorts (LBC) of 1921 and 1936. Replication was assessed in 1,041 to 3,467 individuals. For aPTT, previously reported associations with KNG1, HRG, F11, F12, and ABO were confirmed. A second independent association in ABO was identified and replicated (rs8176704, p = 4.26 × 10(-24)). Pooling the ARIC and replication data yielded two additional loci in F5 (rs6028, p = 3.22 × 10(-9)) and AGBL1 (rs2469184, p = 3.61 × 10(-8)). For PT, significant associations were identified and confirmed in F7 (rs561241, p = 3.71 × 10(-56)) and PROCR/EDEM2 (rs2295888, p = 5.25 × 10(-13)). Assessment of existing gene expression and coronary artery disease (CAD) databases identified associations of five of the GWAS loci with altered gene expression and two with CAD. In summary, eight genetic loci that account for ∼29% of the variance in aPTT and two loci that account for ∼14% of the variance in PT were detected and supported by functional data.",1

22692763,"Sexual dimorphism in various bone phenotypes, including bone mineral density (BMD), is widely observed; however, the extent to which genes explain these sex differences is unclear. To identify variants with different effects by sex, we examined gene-by-sex autosomal interactions genome-wide, and performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis and bioinformatics network analysis. We conducted an autosomal genome-wide meta-analysis of gene-by-sex interaction on lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) BMD in 25,353 individuals from 8 cohorts. In a second stage, we followed up the 12 top single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; p < 1 × 10(-5) ) in an additional set of 24,763 individuals. Gene-by-sex interaction and sex-specific effects were examined in these 12 SNPs. We detected one novel genome-wide significant interaction associated with LS-BMD at the Chr3p26.1-p25.1 locus, near the GRM7 gene (male effect = 0.02 and p = 3.0 × 10(-5) ; female effect = -0.007 and p = 3.3 × 10(-2) ), and 11 suggestive loci associated with either FN- or LS-BMD in discovery cohorts. However, there was no evidence for genome-wide significant (p < 5 × 10(-8) ) gene-by-sex interaction in the joint analysis of discovery and replication cohorts. Despite the large collaborative effort, no genome-wide significant evidence for gene-by-sex interaction was found to influence BMD variation in this screen of autosomal markers. If they exist, gene-by-sex interactions for BMD probably have weak effects, accounting for less than 0.08% of the variation in these traits per implicated SNP. © 2012 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",1
22685391,"Identifying human genes relevant for the processing of pain requires difficult-to-conduct and expensive large-scale clinical trials. Here, we examine a novel integrative paradigm for data-driven discovery of pain gene candidates, taking advantage of the vast amount of existing disease-related clinical literature and gene expression microarray data stored in large international repositories. First, thousands of diseases were ranked according to a disease-specific pain index (DSPI), derived from Medical Subject Heading (MESH) annotations in MEDLINE. Second, gene expression profiles of 121 of these human diseases were obtained from public sources. Third, genes with expression variation significantly correlated with DSPI across diseases were selected as candidate pain genes. Finally, selected candidate pain genes were genotyped in an independent human cohort and prospectively evaluated for significant association between variants and measures of pain sensitivity. The strongest signal was with rs4512126 (5q32, ABLIM3, P = 1.3×10⁻¹⁰) for the sensitivity to cold pressor pain in males, but not in females. Significant associations were also observed with rs12548828, rs7826700 and rs1075791 on 8q22.2 within NCALD (P = 1.7×10⁻⁴, 1.8×10⁻⁴, and 2.2×10⁻⁴ respectively). Our results demonstrate the utility of a novel paradigm that integrates publicly available disease-specific gene expression data with clinical data curated from MEDLINE to facilitate the discovery of pain-relevant genes.

Although recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified some novel loci for lung cancer risk, few addressed genome-wide gene-environment interactions. To determine gene-asbestos interactions in lung cancer risk, we conducted genome-wide gene-environment interaction analyses at levels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genes and pathways, using our published Texas lung cancer GWAS dataset. This dataset included 317 498 SNPs from 1154 lung cancer cases and 1137 cancer-free controls. The initial SNP-level P-values for interactions between genetic variants and self-reported asbestos exposure were estimated by unconditional logistic regression models with adjustment for age, sex, smoking status and pack-years. The P-value for the most significant SNP rs13383928 was 2.17×10(-6), which did not reach the genome-wide statistical significance. Using a versatile gene-based test approach, we found that the top significant gene was C7orf54, located on 7q32.1 (P = 8.90×10(-5)). Interestingly, most of the other significant genes were located on 11q13. When we used an improved gene-set-enrichment analysis approach, we found that  the Fas signaling pathway and the antigen processing and presentation pathway were most significant (nominal P < 0.001; false discovery rate < 0.05) among 250 pathways containing 17 572 genes. We believe that our analysis is a pilot study that first describes the gene-asbestos interaction in lung cancer risk at levels of SNPs, genes and pathways. Our findings suggest that immune function regulation-related pathways may be mechanistically involved in asbestos-associated lung cancer risk.",1
22629410,"Pancreatic tumors are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage in the progression of the disease, thus reducing the survival chances of the patients. Non-invasive early detection would greatly enhance therapy and survival rates. Toward this aim, we investigated in a pilot study the power of methylation changes in whole blood as predictive markers for the detection of pancreatic tumors. We investigated methylation levels at selected CpG sites in the CpG rich regions at the promoter regions of p16, RARbeta, TNFRSF10C, APC, ACIN1, DAPK1, 3OST2, BCL2 and CD44 in the blood of 30 pancreatic tumor patients and in the blood of 49 matching controls. In addition, we studied LINE-1 and Alu repeats using degenerate amplification approach as a surrogate marker for genome-wide methylation. The site-specific methylation measurements at selected CpG sites were done by the SIRPH method. Our results show that in the patient's blood, tumor suppressor genes were slightly but significantly higher methylated at several CpG sites, while repeats were slightly less methylated compared to control blood. This was found to be significantly associated with higher risk for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Additionally, high methylation levels at TNFRSCF10C were associated with positive perineural spread of tumor cells, while higher methylation levels of TNFRSF10C and ACIN1 were significantly associated with shorter survival. This pilot study shows that methylation changes in blood could provide a promising method for early detection of pancreatic tumors. However, larger studies must be carried out to explore the clinical usefulness of a whole blood methylation based test for non-invasive early detection of pancreatic tumors.",1
22619049,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents the most frequent type of aggressive lymphoma. Deletions of the CDKN2A locus, encoding the proteins CDKN2A (P16), P14ARF, and of the CDKN2B locus, encoding the protein CDKN2B (P15), affect one-third of DLBCL patients. Although other mechanisms that decrease gene expression have been reported, such as promoter methylation, the prognostic value of these mechanisms is still unclear. We studied the deletion and methylation status of these genes in 171 patients and correlated the genomic results with their mRNA expression level and clinical outcome. CDKN2A, P14ARF, and CDKN2B deletions were significantly correlated with decreased mRNA expression (P<0.0001, P<0.0001, and P=0.0148, respectively). P14ARF was methylated in only two patients (1.3%), whereas CDKN2A and CDKN2B were methylated in 36.7 and 31.4% of patients, respectively. Methylation levels greater than 25% were associated with decreased expression of CDKN2A (P=0.0169). CDKN2A and CDKN2B inactivation by deletion or methylation was observed in 42.7 and 37.4% of cases, respectively. Including P14ARF deletions, we identified an inactivating mechanism for at least one of these genes in 47% of patients. Although gene inactivation was not correlated with the international prognostic index, P14ARF and CDKN2B inactivation was significantly associated with shorter survival (P=0.0048 and P=0.0413, respectively), whereas CDKN2A was not (P=0.085). Low mRNA expression levels of these genes were correlated with the ABC phenotype. Furthermore, our results show that an inactivating methylation was more frequent in the GCB phenotype.",1
22610116,"Cantú syndrome is characterized by congenital hypertrichosis, distinctive facial features, osteochondrodysplasia and cardiac defects. By using family-based exome sequencing, we identified a de novo mutation in ABCC9. Subsequently, we discovered novel dominant missense mutations in ABCC9 in 14 of the 16 individuals with Cantú syndrome examined. The ABCC9 protein is part of an ATP-dependent potassium (K(ATP)) channel that couples the metabolic state of a cell with its electrical activity. All mutations altered amino acids in or close to the transmembrane domains of ABCC9. Using electrophysiological measurements, we show that mutations in ABCC9 reduce the ATP-mediated potassium channel inhibition, resulting in channel opening. Moreover, similarities between the phenotype of individuals with Cantú syndrome and side effects from the K(ATP) channel agonist minoxidil indicate that the mutations in ABCC9 result in channel opening. Given the availability of ABCC9 antagonists, our findings may have direct implications for the treatment of individuals with Cantú syndrome.",1
22590624,"Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is an obligate intracellular human pathogen that multiplies within a parasitophorous vacuole called an inclusion. We report that the location of several host-cell proteins present in the cytosol, the nucleus, and membranes was altered during Ct development. The acyl-CoA synthetase enzyme ACSL3 and the soluble acyl-CoA binding protein ACBD6 were mobilized from organelle membranes and the nucleus, respectively, into the lumen of the inclusion. The nuclear protein ZNF23, a pro-apoptosis factor, was also translocated into the inclusion lumen. ZNF23, among other proteins, might be targeted by Ct to inhibit host cell apoptosis, thereby enabling bacterial survival. In contrast, the acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase LPCAT1, an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein, was recruited to the inclusion membrane. The coordinated action of ACBD6, ACSL3 and LPCAT1 likely supports remodeling and scavenging of host lipids into bacterial-specific moieties essential to Ct growth. To our knowledge, these are the first identified host proteins known to be intercepted and translocated into the inclusion.",0
22584459,"Association between response to antidepressant treatment and genetic polymorphisms was examined in two independent Japanese samples of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Genome-wide approach using the Illumina Human CNV370-quad Bead Chip was utilized in the analysis of the 92 MDD patients in the first sample. In all, 11 non-intergenic single-nucleotide polymorphisms with uncorrected allelic P-value <0.0001 were selected for the subsequent association analyses in the second sample of 136 MDD patients. Difference in allele distribution between responders and nonresponders were found in the second-stage sample for rs365836 and rs201522 of the CUX1 gene (P=0.005 and 0.004, respectively). The allelic P-values for rs365836 and rs201522 in both samples combined were 0.0000023 and 0.0000040, respectively. Our results provide the first evidence that polymorphisms of the CUX1 gene may be associated with response to antidepressant treatment in Japanese patients with MDD.",1
22578690,"Cutaneous mast cell tumours (MCTs) are the most common skin tumours in dogs. However, the molecular differences between benign tumours with a good prognosis and highly malignant, invasive and metastatic tumours with short survival times are for the most part unclear. In the present study the proteome of low-grade MCTs with a good prognosis was compared with that of poor-prognosis high-grade tumours independent of their mutational status of exon 11 of the KIT gene. Using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, 13 proteins with a significant differential expression between the two groups were identified. Four stress response proteins (HSPA9, PDIA3, TCP1A and TCP1E) were significantly up-regulated in high-grade tumours, while proteins mainly associated with cell motility and metastasis had either increased (WDR1, ACTR3, ANXA6) or decreased (ANXA2, ACTB) expression levels. High-grade tumours also had a paradox down-regulation of transferrin, a protein that is usually up-regulated in neoplastic cells. The histologically observable dedifferentiation of high-grade tumours was reflected by decreased tryptase protein expression levels. Results of quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that the differences in protein expression levels of most proteins were regulated at the transcript level. Based on these findings, it is hypothesized that high-grade MCT cells have a higher resistance to cellular stress and thus are able to better cope with the adverse environment in highly proliferating tumours independent of increased KIT signalling. It is noteworthy that some of the proteins identified have been proposed as therapeutic targets for human oncology and it will be interesting to evaluate their therapeutic and diagnostic potential for canine MCTs.",1
22573489,"Systemic analysis of somatic mutations of other susceptibility genes in syndromic tumors as well as apparently sporadic tumors in well-characterized specimens is lacking. Its clinical relevance has not been studied. Our objective was to determine the frequency of second allele inactivation in syndromic tumors and determine the frequency and potential clinical impact of somatic mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the known susceptibility genes in syndromic and sporadic tumors. Nine tumor specimens from clinically characterized VHL mutation, five from SDHB mutation, four from SDHD mutation, two from RET mutation carriers, and eight from apparently sporadic cases were analyzed. Tumor DNA mutation screening of the SDHx, VHL, and RET genes and LOH analyses of the SDHx and VHL genes were performed. The Yates-corrected chi-squared test was used for comparison of the clinical data and the molecular-genetic results. Second allele inactivation in tumors was identified in 83% of VHL, 80% of SDHB, and 50% of SDHD specimen. High prevalence of VHL (6/6, p=0.024) and SDHB (7/7, p=0.018) somatic mutations has been identified in the sporadic group compared to all others. In the group of the VHL tumors the SDHB somatic events were significantly lower (2/6; p=0.045). In 18/19 (95%) of cases, we were able to demonstrate the presence of at least two concomitant affected susceptibility genes. We conclude that LOH is the most prevalent second allele-inactivating event. SDHB and VHL somatic mutation might play a role in the sporadic forms of tumor development. There is no clinical impact of mutation screening or LOH analysis of tumor specimens.",1
22566624,"Hip osteoarthritis (HOA) is one of the most disabling and common joint disorders with a large genetic component that is, however, still ill-defined. To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in osteoarthritis (OA) and specifically in HOA have yielded only few loci, which is partly explained by heterogeneity in the OA definition. Therefore, we here focused on radiographically measured joint-space width (JSW), a proxy for cartilage thickness and an important underlying intermediate trait for HOA. In a GWAS of 6,523 individuals on hip-JSW, we identified the G allele of rs12982744 on chromosome 19p13.3 to be associated with a 5% larger JSW (P = 4.8 × 10(-10)). The association was replicated in 4,442 individuals from three United Kingdom cohorts with an overall meta-analysis P value of 1.1 × 10(-11). The SNP was also strongly associated with a 12% reduced risk for HOA (P = 1 × 10(-4)). The SNP is located in the DOT1L gene, which is an evolutionarily conserved histone methyltransferase, recently identified as a potentially dedicated enzyme for Wnt target-gene activation in leukemia. Immunohistochemical staining of the DOT1L protein in mouse limbs supports a role for DOT1L in chondrogenic differentiation and adult articular cartilage. DOT1L is also expressed in OA articular chondrocytes. Silencing of Dot1l inhibited chondrogenesis in vitro. Dot1l knockdown reduces proteoglycan and collagen content, and mineralization during chondrogenesis. In the ATDC5 chondrogenesis model system, DOT1L interacts with TCF and Wnt signaling. These data are a further step to better understand the role of Wnt-signaling during chondrogenesis and cartilage homeostasis. DOT1L may represent a therapeutic target for OA.",1
22561292,"In this article we highlight the ways in which young children draw on their family contexts in their meaning making about the causes of illness. Studies of young children's understanding of illness causality have largely focused on the nature of children's knowledge rather than the ways in which children acquire their knowledge. Seeking to advance a socio-constructivist understanding of young children's conceptualization of illness causality, we interviewed five four-year-old children and their family members. Analysis of participants' narrative accounts suggests that young children's illness causality constructions are significantly influenced by the particular illness experiences, illness prevention messages and behavioural rules within families. By identifying and acknowledging young children's meaning making within the socio-cultural context of the family, health practitioners may be better placed to develop effective health education programmes and provide enhanced psychosocial support for young children and their families.",0
22519691,"Gene content and gene-coding percentage can be predicted from genome size in newly sequenced organisms. Here, we investigate whether these predictions are influenced by phylogenetic relationships between the involved species. Combining a highly resolved phylogenetic tree with a large compilation of gene content data, our results reveal the presence of significant phylogenetic structure in the correlations between genome size and gene content in both bacteria and eukaryotes. The variation in log(gene content) explained by log(genome size) in combination with phylogeny was found to be 97% in bacteria and 55% in eukaryotes. Further, in bacteria, gene-coding percentages are only significantly correlated to genome size if phylogenetic information is taken into account in the analyses. These findings support the usage of phylogenetic correlation models for gene content predictions.",0
22488850,"The present study searched for replicable risk genomic regions for alcohol and nicotine co-dependence using a genome-wide association strategy. The data contained a total of 3,143 subjects including 818 European-American (EA) cases with alcohol and nicotine co-dependence, 1,396 EA controls, 449 African-American (AA) cases, and 480 AA controls. We performed separate genome-wide association analyses in EAs and AAs and a meta-analysis to derive combined P-values, and calculated the genome-wide false discovery rate (FDR) for each SNP. Regions with P < 5 × 10(-7) together with FDR < 0.05 in the meta-analysis were examined to detect all replicable risk SNPs across EAs, AAs, and meta-analysis. These SNPs were followed with a series of functional expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses. We found a unique genome-wide significant gene region--SH3BP5-NR2C2--that was enriched with 11 replicable risk SNPs for alcohol and nicotine co-dependence. The distributions of -log(P) values for all SNP-disease associations within this region were consistent across EAs, AAs, and meta-analysis (0.315 ≤ r ≤ 0.868; 8.1 × 10(-52) ≤ P ≤ 3.6 × 10(-5)). In the meta-analysis, this region was the only association peak throughout chromosome 3 at P < 0.0001. All replicable risk markers available for eQTL analysis had nominal cis- and trans-acting regulatory effects on gene expression. The transcript expression of the genes in this region was regulated partly by several nicotine dependence (ND)-related genes and significantly correlated with transcript expression of many alcohol dependence- and ND-related genes. We concluded that the SH3BP5-NR2C2 region on Chromosome 3 might harbor causal loci for alcohol and nicotine co-dependence.",1
22484628,"Gastric cancer is a major cause of global cancer mortality. We surveyed the spectrum of somatic alterations in gastric cancer by sequencing the exomes of 15 gastric adenocarcinomas and their matched normal DNAs. Frequently mutated genes in the adenocarcinomas included TP53 (11/15 tumors), PIK3CA (3/15) and ARID1A (3/15). Cell adhesion was the most enriched biological pathway among the frequently mutated genes. A prevalence screening confirmed mutations in FAT4, a cadherin family gene, in 5% of gastric cancers (6/110) and FAT4 genomic deletions in 4% (3/83) of gastric tumors. Frequent mutations in chromatin remodeling genes (ARID1A, MLL3 and MLL) also occurred in 47% of the gastric cancers. We detected ARID1A mutations in 8% of tumors (9/110), which were associated with concurrent PIK3CA mutations and microsatellite instability. In functional assays, we observed both FAT4 and ARID1A to exert tumor-suppressor activity. Somatic inactivation of FAT4 and ARID1A may thus be key tumorigenic events in a subset of gastric cancers.",1
22482804,"Psoriasis (PS) and Crohn disease (CD) have been shown to be epidemiologically, pathologically, and therapeutically connected, but little is known about their shared genetic causes. We performed meta-analyses of five published genome-wide association studies on PS (2,529 cases and 4,955 controls) and CD (2,142 cases and 5,505 controls), followed up 20 loci that showed strongest evidence for shared disease association and, furthermore, tested cross-disease associations for previously reported PS and CD risk alleles in additional 6,115 PS cases, 4,073 CD cases, and 10,100 controls. We identified seven susceptibility loci outside the human leukocyte antigen region (9p24 near JAK2, 10q22 at ZMIZ1, 11q13 near PRDX5, 16p13 near SOCS1, 17q21 at STAT3, 19p13 near FUT2, and 22q11 at YDJC) shared between PS and CD with genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10(-8)) and confirmed four already established PS and CD risk loci (IL23R, IL12B, REL, and TYK2). Three of the shared loci are also genome-wide significantly associated with PS alone (10q22 at ZMIZ1, p(rs1250544) = 3.53 × 10(-8), 11q13 near PRDX5, p(rs694739) = 3.71 × 10(-09), 22q11 at YDJC, p(rs181359) = 8.02 × 10(-10)). In addition, we identified one susceptibility locus for CD (16p13 near SOCS1, p(rs4780355) = 4.99 × 10(-8)). Refinement of association signals identified shared genome-wide significant associations for exonic SNPs at 10q22 (ZMIZ1) and in silico expression quantitative trait locus analyses revealed that the associations at ZMIZ1 and near SOCS1 have a potential functional effect on gene expression. Our results show the usefulness of joint analyses of clinically distinct immune-mediated diseases and enlarge the map of shared genetic risk loci.",1
22481925,"Two common variants, close from TTF-1 and TTF-2, were shown to predispose to thyroid cancer (TC) in European populations. We aimed to investigate whether TTF-1 and TTF-2 variants might contribute to TC early onset (EO). Tumor samples from eighteen patients with papillary TC (PTC), who underwent total thyroidectomy at an age of ≤21, were screened for TTF-1 and TTF-2 variants. No TTF-1 variants were documented; two novel germinal TTF-2 variants, c.200C>G (p.A67G) and c.510C>A (p.A170A), were identified in two patients. Two already described TTF-2 variants were also documented; the allelic frequency among patients was not different from that observed among controls. Moreover, RET/PTC rearrangements and the BRAFV600E mutation were identified in 5/18 and 2/18 PTCs, respectively. Thyroglobulin (TG) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) expression was found to be significantly decreased in tumors, and the lowest level of TPO expression occurred in a tumor harboring both the p.A67GTTF-2 variant and a RET/PTC3 rearrangement.",1
22479346,"Hypertension is a complex disorder with high prevalence rates all over the world. We conducted the first genome-wide gene-based association scan for hypertension in a Han Chinese population. By analyzing genome-wide single-nucleotide-polymorphism data of 400 matched pairs of young-onset hypertensive patients and normotensive controls genotyped with the Illumina HumanHap550-Duo BeadChip, 100 susceptibility genes for hypertension were identified and also validated with permutation tests. Seventeen of the 100 genes exhibited differential allelic and expression distributions between patient and control groups. These genes provided a good molecular signature for classifying hypertensive patients and normotensive controls. Among the 17 genes, IGF1, SLC4A4, WWOX, and SFMBT1 were not only identified by our gene-based association scan and gene expression analysis but were also replicated by a gene-based association analysis of the Hong Kong Hypertension Study. Moreover, cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci associated with the differentially expressed genes were found and linked to hypertension. IGF1, which encodes insulin-like growth factor 1, is associated with cardiovascular disorders, metabolic syndrome, decreased body weight/size, and changes of insulin levels in mice. SLC4A4, which encodes the electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter 1, is associated with decreased body weight/size and abnormal ion homeostasis in mice. WWOX, which encodes the WW domain-containing protein, is related to hypoglycemia and hyperphosphatemia. SFMBT1, which encodes the scm-like with four MBT domains protein 1, is a novel hypertension gene. GRB14, TMEM56 and KIAA1797 exhibited highly significant differential allelic and expressed distributions between hypertensive patients and normotensive controls. GRB14 was also found relevant to blood pressure in a previous genetic association study in East Asian populations. TMEM56 and KIAA1797 may be specific to Taiwanese populations, because they were not validated by the two replication studies. Identification of these genes enriches the collection of hypertension susceptibility genes, thereby shedding light on the etiology of hypertension in Han Chinese populations.",1
22432041,"Elucidating the genetic architecture of preeclampsia is a major goal in obstetric medicine. We have performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for preeclampsia in unrelated Australian individuals of Caucasian ancestry using the Illumina OmniExpress-12 BeadChip to successfully genotype 648,175 SNPs in 538 preeclampsia cases and 540 normal pregnancy controls. Two SNP associations (rs7579169, p = 3.58×10(-7), OR = 1.57; rs12711941, p = 4.26×10(-7), OR = 1.56) satisfied our genome-wide significance threshold (modified Bonferroni p<5.11×10(-7)). These SNPs reside in an intergenic region less than 15 kb downstream from the 3' terminus of the Inhibin, beta B (INHBB) gene on 2q14.2. They are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with each other (r(2) = 0.92), but not (r(2)<0.80) with any other genotyped SNP ±250 kb. DNA re-sequencing in and around the INHBB structural gene identified an additional 25 variants. Of the 21 variants that we successfully genotyped back in the case-control cohort the most significant association observed was for a third intergenic SNP (rs7576192, p = 1.48×10(-7), OR = 1.59) in strong LD with the two significant GWAS SNPs (r(2)>0.92). We attempted to provide evidence of a putative regulatory role for these SNPs using bioinformatic analyses and found that they all reside within regions of low sequence conservation and/or low complexity, suggesting functional importance is low. We also explored the mRNA expression in decidua of genes ±500 kb of INHBB and found a nominally significant correlation between a transcript encoded by the EPB41L5 gene, ∼250 kb centromeric to INHBB, and preeclampsia (p = 0.03). We were unable to replicate the associations shown by the significant GWAS SNPs in case-control cohorts from Norway and Finland, leading us to conclude that it is more likely that these SNPs are in LD with as yet unidentified causal variant(s).",1
22430674,"Recently, several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have led to the discovery of nine new loci of genetic susceptibility in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the landscape of the AD genetic susceptibility is far away to be complete and in addition to single-SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) analyses as performed in conventional GWAS, complementary strategies need to be applied to overcome limitations inherent to this type of approaches. We performed a genome-wide haplotype association (GWHA) study in the EADI1 study (n=2025 AD cases and 5328 controls) by applying a sliding-windows approach. After exclusion of loci already known to be involved in AD (APOE, BIN1 and CR1), 91 regions with suggestive haplotype effects were identified. In a second step, we attempted to replicate the best suggestive haplotype associations in the GERAD1 consortium (2820 AD cases and 6356 controls) and observed that 9 of them showed nominal association. In a third step, we tested relevant haplotype associations in a combined analysis of five additional case-control studies (5093 AD cases and 4061 controls). We consistently replicated the association of a haplotype within FRMD4A on Chr.10p13 in all the data set analyzed (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: (1.43-1.96); P=1.1 × 10(-10)). We finally searched for association between SNPs within the FRMD4A locus and Aβ plasma concentrations in three independent non-demented populations (n=2579). We reported that polymorphisms were associated with plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (best signal, P=5.4 × 10(-7)). In conclusion, combining both GWHA study and a conservative three-stage replication approach, we characterised FRMD4A as a new genetic risk factor of AD.",1
22399527,"Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified several susceptibility loci for metabolic syndrome (MetS) component traits, but have had variable success in identifying susceptibility loci to the syndrome as an entity. We conducted a GWA study on MetS and its component traits in 4 Finnish cohorts consisting of 2637 MetS cases and 7927 controls, both free of diabetes, and followed the top loci in an independent sample with transcriptome and nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabonomics data. Furthermore, we tested for loci associated with multiple MetS component traits using factor analysis, and built a genetic risk score for MetS.",1
22397156,"This paper defines the history of recent chemistry, and then charts the disappearance of the history of recent chemistry (""how we got here"" history) from general histories of chemistry by the late 1930s. It is also shown how the history of recent chemistry in the early decades of the twentieth century was very much the history of physical chemistry. The revival of the history of recent chemistry is attributed to Eduard Farber and Aaron lhde. Several attempts have been made since the early 1980s to promote the history of recent chemistry, with mixed results. The current situation is assessed, and the paper concludes with a proposal for the entrenchment of the subject.",0
22388998,"Mutations in GBA1 gene result in defective acid β-glucosidase and the complex phenotype of Gaucher disease (GD) related to the accumulation of glucosylceramide-laden macrophages. The phenotype is highly variable even among patients harboring identical GBA1 mutations. We hypothesize that modifier gene(s) underlie phenotypic diversity in GD and performed a GWAS study in Ashkenazi Jewish patients with type 1 GD (GD1), homozygous for N370S mutation. Patients were assigned to mild, moderate, or severe disease categories using composite disease severity scoring systems. Whole-genome genotyping for >500,000 SNPs was performed to search for association signals using OQLS algorithm in 139 eligible patients. Several SNPs in linkage disequilibrium within the CLN8 gene locus were associated with the GD1 severity: SNP rs11986414 was associated with GD1 severity at P value 1.26 × 10(-6) . Compared to mild disease, risk allele A at rs11986414 conferred an odds ratio of 3.72 for moderate/severe disease. Loss of function mutations in CLN8 causes neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis, but our results indicate that its increased expression may protect against severe GD1. In cultured skin fibroblasts, the relative expression of CLN8 was higher in mild GD compared to severely affected patients, in whom CLN8 risk alleles were overrepresented. In an in vitro cell model of GD, CLN8 expression was increased, which was further enhanced in the presence of bioactive substrate, glucosylsphingosine. Taken together, CLN8 is a candidate modifier gene for GD1 that may function as a protective sphingolipid sensor and/or in glycosphingolipid trafficking. Future studies should explore the role of CLN8 in pathophysiology of GD.",1
22370639,"Zinc-finger protein 331 (ZNF331), a Kruppel-associated box zinc-finger protein gene, was identified as a putative tumor suppressor in our previous study. However, the role of ZNF331 in tumorigenesis remains elusive. We aimed to clarify its epigenetic regulation and biological functions in gastric cancer. ZNF331 was silenced or downregulated in 71% (12/17) gastric cancer cell lines. A significant downregulation was also detected in paired gastric tumors compared with adjacent non-cancer tissues. In contrast, ZNF331 was readily expressed in various normal adult tissues. The downregulation of ZNF331 was closely linked to the promoter hypermethylation as evidenced by methylation-specific PCR, bisulfite genomic sequencing and reexpression by demethylation agent treatment. DNA sequencing showed no genetic mutation/deletion of ZNF331 in gastric cancer cell lines. Ectopic expression of ZNF331 in the silenced cancer cell lines MKN28 and HCT116 significantly reduced colony formation and cell viability, induced cell cycle arrests and repressed cell migration and invasive ability. Concordantly, knockdown of ZNF331 increased cell viability and colony formation ability of gastric cancer cell line MKN45. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry-based comparative proteomic approach were applied to analyze the molecular basis of the biological functions of ZNF331. In all, 10 downstream targets of ZNF331 were identified to be associated with regulation of cell growth and metastasis. The tumor-suppressive effect of ZNF331 is mediated at least by downregulation of genes involved in cell growth promotion (DSTN, EIF5A, GARS, DDX5, STAM, UQCRFS1 and SET) and migration/invasion (DSTN and ACTR3), and upregulation of genome-stability gene (SSBP1) and cellular senescence gene (PNPT1). A novel target of ZNF331 (DSTN) was functionally validated. Overexpression of DSTN in BGC-823 cells increased colony formation and migration ability. In conclusion, our results suggest that ZNF331 possesses important functions for the suppression of gastric carcinogenesis as a novel functional tumor-suppressor gene.",1
22366783,"Brain malformations are individually rare but collectively common causes of developmental disabilities. Many forms of malformation occur sporadically and are associated with reduced reproductive fitness, pointing to a causative role for de novo mutations. Here, we report a study of Baraitser-Winter syndrome, a well-defined disorder characterized by distinct craniofacial features, ocular colobomata and neuronal migration defect. Using whole-exome sequencing of three proband-parent trios, we identified de novo missense changes in the cytoplasmic actin-encoding genes ACTB and ACTG1 in one and two probands, respectively. Sequencing of both genes in 15 additional affected individuals identified disease-causing mutations in all probands, including two recurrent de novo alterations (ACTB, encoding p.Arg196His, and ACTG1, encoding p.Ser155Phe). Our results confirm that trio-based exome sequencing is a powerful approach to discover genes causing sporadic developmental disorders, emphasize the overlapping roles of cytoplasmic actin proteins in development and suggest that Baraitser-Winter syndrome is the predominant phenotype associated with mutation of these two genes.",1
22328085,"Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is a contiguous gene deletion disorder associated with the distal part of the short arm of chromosome 4 (4p16.3). Employing a unique panel of patient-derived cell lines with differing-sized 4p deletions, we provide evidence that haploinsufficiency of SLBP and/or WHSC2 (NELF-A) contributes to several novel cellular phenotypes of WHS, including delayed progression from S-phase into M-phase, reduced DNA replication in asynchronous culture and altered higher order chromatin assembly. The latter is evidenced by reduced histone-chromatin association, elevated levels of soluble chaperone-bound histone H3 and increased sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease digestion in WHS patient-derived cells. We also observed increased camptothecin-induced inhibition of DNA replication and hypersensitivity to killing. Our work provides a novel pathogenomic insight into the aetiology of WHS by describing it, for the first time, as a disorder of impaired chromatin reorganization. Delayed cell-cycle progression and impaired DNA replication likely underlie or contribute to microcephaly, pre- and postnatal growth retardation, which constitute the core clinical features of WHS.",1
22318994,"The clinical significance of copy number variants (CNVs) in congenital heart disease (CHD) continues to be a challenge. Although CNVs including genes can confer disease risk, relationships between gene dosage and phenotype are still being defined. Our goal was to perform a quantitative analysis of CNVs involving 100 well-defined CHD risk genes identified through previously published human association studies in subjects with anatomically defined cardiac malformations. A novel analytical approach permitting CNV gene frequency ""spectra"" to be computed over prespecified regions to determine phenotype-gene dosage relationships was employed. CNVs in subjects with CHD (n = 945), subphenotyped into 40 groups and verified in accordance with the European Paediatric Cardiac Code, were compared with two control groups, a disease-free cohort (n = 2,026) and a population with coronary artery disease (n = 880). Gains (≥200 kb) and losses (≥100 kb) were determined over 100 CHD risk genes and compared using a Barnard exact test. Six subphenotypes showed significant enrichment (P ≤ 0.05), including aortic stenosis (valvar), atrioventricular canal (partial), atrioventricular septal defect with tetralogy of Fallot, subaortic stenosis, tetralogy of Fallot, and truncus arteriosus. Furthermore, CNV gene frequency spectra were enriched (P ≤ 0.05) for losses at: FKBP6, ELN, GTF2IRD1, GATA4, CRKL, TBX1, ATRX, GPC3, BCOR, ZIC3, FLNA and MID1; and gains at: PRKAB2, FMO5, CHD1L, BCL9, ACP6, GJA5, HRAS, GATA6 and RUNX1. Of CHD subjects, 14% had causal chromosomal abnormalities, and 4.3% had likely causal (significantly enriched), large, rare CNVs. CNV frequency spectra combined with precision phenotyping may lead to increased molecular understanding of etiologic pathways.",1
22317976,"Treacher-Collins-Franceschetti syndrome (TCS) is an autosomal dominant craniofacial disorder characterised by midface hypoplasia, micrognathia, downslanting palpebral fissures, eyelid colobomata, and ear deformities that often lead to conductive deafness. A total of 182 patients with signs consistent with a diagnosis of TCS were screened by DNA sequence and dosage analysis of the TCOF1 gene. In all, 92 cases were found to have a pathogenic mutation by sequencing and 5 to have a partial gene deletion. A further case had a novel in-frame deletion in the alternatively spliced exon 6A of uncertain pathogenicity. The majority of the pathogenic sequence changes were found to predict premature protein termination, however, four novel missense changes in the LIS1 homology motif at the 5' end of the gene were identified. The partial gene deletions of different sizes represent ~5.2% of all the pathogenic TCOF1 mutations identified, indicating that gene rearrangements account for a significant proportion of TCS cases. This is the first report of gene rearrangements resulting in TCS. These findings expand the TCOF1 mutation spectrum indicating that dosage analysis should be performed together with sequence analysis, a strategy that is predicted to have a sensitivity of 71% for patients in whom TCS is strongly suspected.",1
22298814,"If one gene regulates another, those two genes are likely to be involved in many of the same biological functions. Conversely, shared biological function may be suggestive of the existence and nature of a regulatory interaction. With this in mind, we develop a measure of functional similarity between genes based on annotations made to the Gene Ontology in which the magnitude of their functional relationship is also indicative of a regulatory relationship. In contrast to other measures that have previously been used to quantify the functional similarity between genes, our measure scales the strength of any shared functional annotation by the frequency of that function's appearance across the entire set of annotations. We apply our method to both Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene annotations and find that the strength of our scaled similarity measure is more predictive of known regulatory interactions than previously published measures of functional similarity. In addition, we observe that the strength of the scaled similarity measure is correlated with the structural importance of links in the known regulatory network. By contrast, other measures of functional similarity are not indicative of any structural importance in the regulatory network. We therefore conclude that adequately adjusting for the frequency of shared biological functions is important in the construction of a functional similarity measure aimed at elucidating the existence and nature of regulatory interactions. We also compare the performance of the scaled similarity with a high-throughput method for determining regulatory interactions from gene expression data and observe that the ontology-based approach identifies a different subset of regulatory interactions compared with the gene expression approach. We show that combining predictions from the scaled similarity with those from the reconstruction algorithm leads to a significant improvement in the accuracy of the reconstructed network.",0
22297845,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the Western world. Twenty per cent of NAFLD individuals develop chronic hepatic inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH) associated with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, yet the causes of progression from NAFLD to NASH remain obscure. Here, we show that the NLRP6 and NLRP3 inflammasomes and the effector protein IL-18 negatively regulate NAFLD/NASH progression, as well as multiple aspects of metabolic syndrome via modulation of the gut microbiota. Different mouse models reveal that inflammasome-deficiency-associated changes in the configuration of the gut microbiota are associated with exacerbated hepatic steatosis and inflammation through influx of TLR4 and TLR9 agonists into the portal circulation, leading to enhanced hepatic tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression that drives NASH progression. Furthermore, co-housing of inflammasome-deficient mice with wild-type mice results in exacerbation of hepatic steatosis and obesity. Thus, altered interactions between the gut microbiota and the host, produced by defective NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasome sensing, may govern the rate of progression of multiple metabolic syndrome-associated abnormalities, highlighting the central role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of heretofore seemingly unrelated systemic auto-inflammatory and metabolic disorders.",1
22295056,"Acute Lung Injury (ALI) is a syndrome with high associated mortality characterized by severe hypoxemia and pulmonary infiltrates in patients with critical illness. We conducted the first investigation to use the genome wide association (GWA) approach to identify putative risk variants for ALI. Genome wide genotyping was performed using the Illumina Human Quad 610 BeadChip. We performed a two-stage GWA study followed by a third stage of functional characterization. In the discovery phase (Phase 1), we compared 600 European American trauma-associated ALI cases with 2266 European American population-based controls. We carried forward the top 1% of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at p<0.01 to a replication phase (Phase 2) comprised of a nested case-control design sample of 212 trauma-associated ALI cases and 283 at-risk trauma non-ALI controls from ongoing cohort studies. SNPs that replicated at the 0.05 level in Phase 2 were subject to functional validation (Phase 3) using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses in stimulated B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) in family trios. 159 SNPs from the discovery phase replicated in Phase 2, including loci with prior evidence for a role in ALI pathogenesis. Functional evaluation of these replicated SNPs revealed rs471931 on 11q13.3 to exert a cis-regulatory effect on mRNA expression in the PPFIA1 gene (p = 0.0021). PPFIA1 encodes liprin alpha, a protein involved in cell adhesion, integrin expression, and cell-matrix interactions. This study supports the feasibility of future multi-center GWA investigations of ALI risk, and identifies PPFIA1 as a potential functional candidate ALI risk gene for future research.",1
22286061,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal brain tumour in adults and children. However, DNA copy number and gene expression signatures indicate differences between adult and paediatric cases. To explore the genetic events underlying this distinction, we sequenced the exomes of 48 paediatric GBM samples. Somatic mutations in the H3.3-ATRX-DAXX chromatin remodelling pathway were identified in 44% of tumours (21/48). Recurrent mutations in H3F3A, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant H3.3, were observed in 31% of tumours, and led to amino acid substitutions at two critical positions within the histone tail (K27M, G34R/G34V) involved in key regulatory post-translational modifications. Mutations in ATRX (α-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked) and DAXX (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits of a chromatin remodelling complex required for H3.3 incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres, were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumours harbouring a G34R or G34V H3.3 mutation. Somatic TP53 mutations were identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with H3F3A and/or ATRX mutations. Screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades and histologies (n = 784) showed H3F3A mutations to be specific to GBM and highly prevalent in children and young adults. Furthermore, the presence of H3F3A/ATRX-DAXX/TP53 mutations was strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and specific gene expression profiles. This is, to our knowledge, the first report to highlight recurrent mutations in a regulatory histone in humans, and our data suggest that defects of the chromatin architecture underlie paediatric and young adult GBM pathogenesis.",1
22281314,"Physiology deals with the functions of living organisms and their systems, and its scientific endeavors can be viewed as having temporally occurred in 3 phases. The first phase of physiology studies focused on determining the functions of particular organs and tissues and their functional differences according to physiological status. The second phase of studies focused on characterizing differences in these functions according to the environment, or productivity. The third phase of studies focuses on determining the physiological causes of differences in productivity. Distinguishing cause from effect in physiological systems of inter-related processes is problematic, such that science has struggled to identify the root physiological mechanisms and their role in the network of genes leading to differences in productivity. Genomics is the study of the entire genome and provides powerful new tools that will accelerate third-phase discoveries of causal physiological processes. That research exploits information on DNA polymorphisms known as markers, complete DNA sequence, RNA sequence, and RNA expression in particular tissues at specific life stages. Physiologists can determine the genetic cause of mutant animals, identify genetic differences between cases and controls, and identify genes responsible for differences in performance between average and above-average animals. In some species, physiologists can leverage genomic data being used to predict genetic merit in elite seedstock populations, as a starting point to identify genes that will then motivate detailed physiological studies in the organs or tissues and stages of life in which those genes are expressed. Such work will increase our knowledge of biology and may lead to novel approaches to manipulate animal performance.",0
22278926,"The importance of Hox genes in the specification of neuronal fates in the spinal cord has long been recognized. However, the transcriptional controls underlying their collinear expression domains remain largely unknown. Here we show in mice that the correspondence between the physical order of Hoxd genes and their rostral expression boundaries, although respecting spatial collinearity, does not display a fully progressive distribution. Instead, two major anteroposterior boundaries are detected, coinciding with the functional subdivision of the spinal cord. Tiling array analyses reveal two distinct blocks of transcription, regulated independently from one another, that define the observed expression boundaries. Targeted deletions in vivo that remove the genomic fragments separating the two blocks induce ectopic expression of posterior genes. We further evaluate the independent regulatory potential and transcription profile of each gene locus by a tiling array approach using a contiguous series of transgenes combined with locus-specific deletions. Our work uncovers a bimodal type of HoxD spatial collinearity in the developing spinal cord that relies on two separate 'enhancer mini-hubs' to ensure correct Hoxd gene expression levels while maintaining their appropriate anteroposterior boundaries.",1
22258409,"Poor data have been previously reported about the mutation rates in K-RAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA genes among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we further elucidated the role of these genes in pathogenesis of primary hepatic malignancies. Archival tumour tissue from 65 HCC patients originating from South Italy were screened for mutations in these candidate genes by direct sequencing. Overall, oncogenic mutations were detected in 15 (23%) patients for BRAF gene, 18 (28%) for PIK3CA gene, and 1 (2%) for K-RAS gene. Using statistical analysis, BRAF mutations were significantly correlated with the presence of either multiple HCC nodules (P=0.021) or higher proliferation rates (P=0.034). Although further extensive screenings are awaited in HCC patients among different populations, our findings clearly indicated that mutational activation of both BRAF and PIK3CA genes does contribute to hepatocellular tumorigenesis at somatic level in Southern Italian population.",1
22209246,"Porencephaly is a neurological disorder characterized by fluid-filled cysts or cavities in the brain that often cause hemiplegia. It has been suggested that porencephalic cavities result from focal cerebral degeneration involving hemorrhages. De novo or inherited heterozygous mutations in COL4A1, which encodes the type IV α1 collagen chain that is essential for structural integrity for vascular basement membranes, have been reported in individuals with porencephaly. Most mutations occurred at conserved Gly residues in the Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats of the triple-helical domain, leading to alterations of the α1α1α2 heterotrimers. Here we report on two individuals with porencephaly caused by a heterozygous missense mutation in COL4A2, which encodes the type IV α2 collagen chain. Mutations c.3455G>A and c.3110G>A, one in each of the individuals, cause Gly residues in the Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeat to be substituted as p.Gly1152Asp and p.Gly1037Glu, respectively, probably resulting in alterations of the α1α1α2 heterotrimers. The c.3455G>A mutation was found in the proband's mother, who showed very mild monoparesis of the left upper extremity, and the maternal elder uncle, who had congenital hemiplegia. The maternal grandfather harboring the mutation is asymptomatic. The c.3110G>A mutation occurred de novo. Our study confirmed that abnormalities of the α1α1α2 heterotrimers of type IV collagen cause porencephaly and stresses the importance of screening for COL4A2 as well as for COL4A1.",1
22197932,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a commonly occurring chronic skin disease with high heritability. Apart from filaggrin (FLG), the genes influencing atopic dermatitis are largely unknown. We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 5,606 affected individuals and 20,565 controls from 16 population-based cohorts and then examined the ten most strongly associated new susceptibility loci in an additional 5,419 affected individuals and 19,833 controls from 14 studies. Three SNPs reached genome-wide significance in the discovery and replication cohorts combined, including rs479844 upstream of OVOL1 (odds ratio (OR) = 0.88, P = 1.1 × 10(-13)) and rs2164983 near ACTL9 (OR = 1.16, P = 7.1 × 10(-9)), both of which are near genes that have been implicated in epidermal proliferation and differentiation, as well as rs2897442 in KIF3A within the cytokine cluster at 5q31.1 (OR = 1.11, P = 3.8 × 10(-8)). We also replicated association with the FLG locus and with two recently identified association signals at 11q13.5 (rs7927894; P = 0.008) and 20q13.33 (rs6010620; P = 0.002). Our results underline the importance of both epidermal barrier function and immune dysregulation in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis.",1
22177454,"Somatic mutations of the two genes coding for the histone acetyltransferase genes, CREEBP and EP300 have been identified as a pathogenetic mechanism shared by common forms of B-cell non-Hodgkińs lymphomas. A screening for somatic mutations in CREEBP and EP300 genes in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) has not previously been performed. DNA was purified from diagnostic samples of 56 MPN patients. We designed a mutation screening assay based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing. Our results suggest that CREBBP and EP300 mutations are not major pathogenetic mechanisms of MPNs. The rationale for using HDACi in these patients seems reasonable.",1
22174261,"Synthetic genetic interactions reveal buffering mechanisms in the cell against genetic perturbations. These interactions have been widely used by researchers to predict functional similarity of gene pairs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of various methods for predicting co-pathway membership of genes based on their neighborhood similarity in the genetic network. We clearly delineate the scope of these methods and use it to motivate a rigorous statistical framework for quantifying the contribution of each pathway to the functional similarity of gene pairs. We then use our model to infer interdependencies among KEGG pathways. The resulting KEGG crosstalk map yields significant insights into the high-level organization of the genetic network and is used to explain the effective scope of genetic interactions for predicting co-pathway membership of gene pairs. A direct byproduct of this effort is that we are able to identify subsets of genes in each pathway that act as 'ports' for interaction across pathways.",0
22174160,"The molecular mechanisms that underlie T-cell quiescence are poorly understood. In the present study, we report a primary immunodeficiency phenotype associated with MST1 deficiency and primarily characterized by a progressive loss of naive T cells. The in vivo consequences include recurrent bacterial and viral infections and autoimmune manifestations. MST1-deficient T cells poorly expressed the transcription factor FOXO1, the IL-7 receptor, and BCL2. Conversely, FAS expression and the FAS-mediating apoptotic pathway were up-regulated. These abnormalities suggest that increased cell death of naive and proliferating T cells is the main mechanism underlying this novel immunodeficiency. Our results characterize a new mechanism in primary T-cell immunodeficiencies and highlight a role of the MST1/FOXO1 pathway in controlling the death of human naive T cells.",1
22171074,"Triglyceride (TG) is a complex phenotype influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genes or loci affecting lipid levels; however, such studies in Chinese populations are limited. A two-stage GWAS were conducted to identify genetic variants that were associated with TG in a Chinese population of 3495 men. Gene-environment interactions on serum TG levels were further investigated for the seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were studied in both stages. Two previously reported SNPs (rs651821 in APOA5, rs328 in LPL) were replicated in the second stage, and the combined P-values were 9.19 × 10(-26) and 1.41 × 10(-9) for rs651821 and rs328, respectively. More importantly, a significant interaction between aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) rs671 and alcohol consumption on serum TG levels were observed (P = 3.34 × 10(-5)). Rs671 was significantly associated with serum TG levels in drinkers (P = 1.90 × 10(-10)), while no association was observed in non-drinkers (P > 0.05). For drinkers, men carrying the AA/AG genotype have significantly lower serum TG levels, compared with men carrying the GG genotype. For men with the GG genotype, the serum TG levels increased with the quantity of alcohol intake (P = 1.28 × 10(-8) for trend test). We identified a novel, significant interaction effect between alcohol consumption and the ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism on TG levels, which suggests that the effect of alcohol intake on TG occurs in a two-faceted manner. Just one drink can increase TG level in susceptible individuals who carry the GG genotype, while individuals carrying AA/AG genotypes may actually benefit from moderate drinking.",1
22163040,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypical autoimmune disease in which increased apoptosis and decreased apoptotic cells removal has been described as most relevant in the pathogenesis. Long-chain acyl-coenzyme A synthetases (ACSLs) have been involved in the immunological dysfunction of mouse models of lupus-like autoimmunity and apoptosis in different in vitro cell systems. The aim of this work was to assess among the ACSL isoforms the involvement of ACSL2, ACSL4 and ACSL5 in SLE pathogenesis.",1
22156575,"The most dramatic growth of the human brain occurs in utero and during the first 2 years of postnatal life. Genesis of the cerebral cortex involves cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, all of which may be influenced by prenatal environment. Here, we show that variation in KCTD8 (potassium channel tetramerization domain 8) is associated with brain size in female adolescents (rs716890, P = 5.40 × 10(-09)). Furthermore, we found that the KCTD8 locus interacts with prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking vis-à-vis cortical area and cortical folding: In exposed girls only, the KCTD8 locus explains up to 21% of variance. Using head circumference as a proxy of brain size at 7 years of age, we have replicated this gene-environment interaction in an independent sample. We speculate that KCTD8 might modulate adverse effects of smoking during pregnancy on brain development via apoptosis triggered by low intracellular levels of potassium, possibly reducing the number of progenitor cells.",1
22147889,"Split-hand/foot malformation (SHFM)-also known as ectrodactyly-is a congenital disorder characterised by severe malformations of the distal limbs affecting the central rays of hands and/or feet. A distinct entity termed SHFLD presents with SHFM and long bone deficiency. Mouse models suggest that a defect of the central apical ectodermal ridge leads to the phenotype. Although six different loci/mutations (SHFM1-6) have been associated with SHFM, the underlying cause in a large number of cases is still unresolved.",1
22118420,"Variants in the UGT1A1 gene and its promoter are known to determine levels of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB), but do not explain all cases of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. To discover associations with variants in genes other than UGT1A1, we undertook a genome-wide association study. We recruited 200 participants to cover the entire range of quantitative variation in UCB level. The data set -- after data curation, including analyses for population stratification and cryptic relatedness -- comprised genotypes at 512,349 SNP loci on 182 individuals. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) association analyses were performed, after adjusting the UCB level for effects of age, gender, and genotype at the dinucleotide (TA) insertion locus in UGT1A1 that is known to significantly modulate UCB level. A significant association of a polymorphic marker (rs2328136) near the NUP153 gene (which produces a 153 kDa nucleoporin) was obtained (p = 0.002, after multiple-testing correction). The frequency of the variant allele (A) at the rs2328136 locus in our study population is 40%, higher than most global populations. NUP153, whose product is a major regulatory factor in bidirectional transport of biomolecules across nucleus to cytosol, is associated with the transport of biliverdin reductase, which is important for bilirubin conjugation.",1
22105620,"Unbiased genome-wide screens combined with imaging data on brain function may identify novel molecular pathways related to human cognition. Here we performed a dense genome-wide screen to identify episodic memory-related gene variants. A genomic locus encoding the brain-expressed beta-catenin-like protein 1 (CTNNBL1) was significantly (P=7 × 10(-8)) associated with verbal memory performance in a cognitively healthy cohort from Switzerland (n=1073) and was replicated in a second cohort from Serbia (n=524; P=0.003). Gene expression studies showed CTNNBL1 genotype-dependent differences in beta-catenin-like protein 1 mRNA levels in the human cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging in 322 subjects detected CTNNBL1 genotype-dependent differences in memory-related brain activations. Converging evidence from independent experiments and different methodological approaches suggests a role for CTNNBL1 in human memory.",1
22083274,"Fungal secondary metabolites have been considered promising resources in the search for novel bioactive compounds. Given the high potential of fungi as genetic resources, it is essential to find an efficient way to link biosynthetic genes to the product in a heterologous system, because many genes for the secondary metabolite in the original strain are silent under standard laboratory conditions. In a previous study, we constructed a heterologous expression system for a biosynthetic gene cluster using Aspergillus oryzae as the host. To make the host more versatile for the expression of secondary metabolism genes, the expression levels of a global regulator, laeA, were increased by placing the A. oryzae laeA gene under the control of the constitutive active pgk promoter. In the A. oryzae overexpressing laeA, two clusters of heterologous biosynthetic genes [the monacolin K (MK) gene cluster from Monascus pilosus and the terrequinone A (TQ) gene cluster from Aspergillus nidulans] were successfully overexpressed, resulting in the production of the corresponding metabolite, MK or TQ. The successful production of secondary metabolites belonging to different structural groups, namely MK as a polyketide and TQ as a hybrid of amino acid and isoprenoid, indicated that the laeA-enriched A. oryzae was a versatile host for the heterologous expression of the biosynthetic gene cluster.",0
22065538,"Adiponectin is most abundantly expressed in adipose tissue and well known to play an important role in metabolic regulation. Several studies have attempted to identify the genetic determinants of metabolic syndrome (MetS), though no study has revealed a cis- or trans-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that affects plasma adiponectin levels, except the adiponectin structure gene and genes encoding adiponectin-regulatory proteins. We performed a genome-wide association study in regards to plasma adiponectin concentrations in 3,310 Japanese subjects. We identified the strongest statistically associated SNP (rs4783244) with adiponectin levels (P = 3.8 × 10(-19)) in the first intron of CDH13 (T-cadherin) gene in a 30-kb haplotype block covering the promoter region to first intron. In addition, rs12051272 SNP genotypes in linkage disequilibrium with rs4783244 were found to be more significantly associated with adiponectin levels (P = 9.5×10(-20)) and specifically with the levels of high-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin, a subtype form associated with parameters related to glucose metabolism. Our results did show more significant association with adiponectin levels than rs12444338 (in CDH13) SNP genotypes reported recently. We suggest that the phenotype-affecting haplotype tagged by rs12051272 SNP would affect the plasma adiponectin levels and that we have to take the CDH13 genotype into account before considering the functional relevance of the adiponectin level.",1
22060042,"The evolution of vertebrate genomes was accompanied by an astounding increase in the complexity of their regulatory modalities. Genetic redundancy resulting from large-scale genome duplications at the base of the chordate tree was repeatedly exploited by the functional redeployment of paralogous genes via innovations in their regulatory circuits. As a paradigm of such regulatory evolution, we have extensively studied those control mechanisms at work in-cis over vertebrate Hox gene clusters. Here, we review the portfolio of genetic strategies that have been developed to tackle the intricate relationship between genomic topography and the transcriptional activities in this gene family, and we describe some of the mechanistic insights we gained by using the HoxD cluster as an example. We discuss the high heuristic value of this system in our general understanding of how changes in transcriptional regulation can diversify gene function and thereby fuel morphological evolution.",0
22054130,"The development of technetium chemistry has been lagging behind that of its heavier congener rhenium, primarily because the inherent radioactivity of all Tc isotopes has limited the number of laboratories that can study the chemistry of this fascinating element. Although technetium  is an artificial element, it is not rare. Significant amounts of the isotope (99)Tc are produced every day as a fission byproduct in nuclear power plants. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the chemistry of (99)Tc is essential to avoid its release into the environment.  In this article the chemistry of technetium at its highest oxidation state (+VII) is reviewed with a special focus on recent developments which make water-stable complexes of the general type [TcO(3)(tacn-R)](+) (tacn-R = 1,4,7-triazacyclononane or derivatives) accessible.  Complexes containing the fac-{TcO(3)}(+) core display a unique reactivity. In analogy to [OsO(4)] and [RuO(4)], complexes containing the fac-{TcO(3)}(+) core undergo with alkenes metal-mediated, vicinal cis-dihydroxylation  reactions (alkene-glycol interconversion) in water via a (3+2)-cycloaddition reaction. Therefore, water-stable fac-{(99m)TcO(3)}(+) complexes pave the way for a new labeling strategy for radiopharmaceutical applications, based on (3+2)-cycloaddition  reactions. This new concept for the labeling of biomolecules with small [(99m)TcO(3)(tacn-R)](+)-type complexes by way of a (3+2)-cycloaddition with alkenes is discussed in detail. The herein reported developments in high-valent technetium chemistry create a new  field of research with this artificial element. This demonstrates the potential of fundamental research to provide new impetus of innovation for the development of new methods for radiopharmaceutical applications.",1

22045723,"In response to questions about tools for nutrition screening, an evidence analysis project was developed to identify the most valid and reliable nutrition screening tools for use in acute care and hospital-based ambulatory care settings. An oversight group defined nutrition screening and literature search criteria. A trained analyst conducted structured searches of the literature for studies of nutrition screening tools according to predetermined criteria. Eleven nutrition screening tools designed to detect undernutrition in patients in acute care and hospital-based ambulatory care were identified. Trained analysts evaluated articles for quality using criteria specified by the American Dietetic Association's Evidence Analysis Library. Members of the oversight group assigned quality grades to the tools based on the quality of the supporting evidence, including reliability and validity data. One tool, the NRS-2002, received a grade I, and 4 tools-the Simple Two-Part Tool, the Mini-Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF), the Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST), and Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST)-received a grade II. The MST was the only tool shown to be both valid and reliable for identifying undernutrition in the settings studied. Thus, validated nutrition screening tools that are simple and easy to use are available for application in acute care and hospital-based ambulatory care settings.",0
22037553,"Estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer shows a higher incidence in women of African ancestry compared to women of European ancestry. In search of common risk alleles for ER-negative breast cancer, we combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from women of African ancestry (1,004 ER-negative cases and 2,745 controls) and European ancestry (1,718 ER-negative cases and 3,670 controls), with replication testing conducted in an additional 2,292 ER-negative cases and 16,901 controls of European ancestry. We identified a common risk variant for ER-negative breast cancer at the TERT-CLPTM1L locus on chromosome 5p15 (rs10069690: per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.18 per allele, P = 1.0 × 10(-10)). The variant was also significantly associated with triple-negative (ER-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative and human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2)-negative) breast cancer (OR = 1.25, P = 1.1 × 10(-9)), particularly in younger women (<50 years of age) (OR = 1.48, P = 1.9 × 10(-9)). Our results identify a genetic locus associated with estrogen receptor negative breast cancer subtypes in multiple populations.",1
22032556,"Male-pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia, AGA) is the most common form of hair loss among humans. Research has shown that it is caused by genetic factors. Numerous studies have unequivocally identified two major genetic risk loci for AGA: the X-chromosomal AR/EDA2R locus, and the PAX1/FOXA2 locus on chromosome 20.",1
22022213,"Understanding the mechanisms of long chain fatty acid (LCFA) uptake in hepatic cells is of high medical importance to treat and to prevent fatty liver disease (FLD). ACSs (Acyl-CoA synthetases) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the esterification of fatty acids (FA) with CoA. Recent studies suggest that ACS enzymes drive the uptake of LCFA indirectly by their enzymatic activity and could promote special metabolic pathways dependent on their localization.The only protein located at the plasma membrane which has consistently been shown to enhance FA uptake is CD36.",0
22004471,"Alcohol dependence (AD) is an important contributory factor to the global burden of disease. The etiology of AD involves both environmental and genetic factors, and the disorder has a heritability of around 50%. The aim of the present study was to identify susceptibility genes for AD by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The sample comprised 1333 male in-patients with severe AD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, and 2168 controls. These included 487 patients and 1358 controls from a previous GWAS study by our group. All individuals were of German descent. Single-marker tests and a polygenic score-based analysis to assess the combined contribution of multiple markers with small effects were performed. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1789891, which is located between the ADH1B and ADH1C genes, achieved genome-wide significance [P = 1.27E-8, odds ratio (OR) = 1.46]. Other markers from this region were also associated with AD, and conditional analyses indicated that these made a partially independent contribution. The SNP rs1789891 is in complete linkage disequilibrium with the functional Arg272Gln variant (P = 1.24E-7, OR = 1.31) of the ADH1C gene, which has been reported to modify the rate of ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde in vitro. A polygenic score-based approach produced a significant result (P = 9.66E-9). This is the first GWAS of AD to provide genome-wide significant support for the role of the ADH gene cluster and to suggest a polygenic component to the etiology of AD. The latter result may indicate that many more AD susceptibility genes still await identification.",1
22004137,"Host genetics play a vital role in determining clinical outcomes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. To identify novel susceptibility loci to HBV progression, we carried out a genome-wide association study with DNA pooling. This study assessed the relationship between 8 highly-ranked SNPs selected from our DNA pool and disease progression of HBV infection in two independent case-control studies. The first population included 628 asymptomatic HBV carriers (AsC) and 1729 progressed HBV carriers recruited from Hubei Province in south China. The second population was composed of 226 AsC and 215 progressed HBV carriers recruited from Shandong Province in north China. Of the 8 SNPs, variant rs11866328 (G/T), located in the glutamate receptor ionotropic N-methyl D-aspartate 2A (GRIN2A) gene, was replicated and had significant associations with disease progression of HBV infection in the DNA pooling stage both in the Hubei (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.34,2.02; p=1.96 × 10(-6); additive model), and in the Shandong (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.14,2.65; p=1.00×10(-2); additive model) population. Polymorphism rs11866328 in the GRIN2A gene might be a genetic variant underlying the susceptibility of HBV carriers to disease progression.",1
21997290,"The pathological diagnosis of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is still challenging for its rarity and the presence of special variants (pediatric, oncocytic, myxoid, and sarcomatoid). It is based on the recognition at light microscopy of at least three among nine morphological parameters, according to the Weiss scoring system, which has been introduced 27 years ago and nowadays is the most widely employed. Nevertheless, the diagnostic performance of this system is very high but does not reach a sensitivity and specificity of 100%, its diagnostic applicability is potentially low among non-expert pathologists, and a group of borderline cases with only one or two criteria exist of uncertain behavior. Moreover, it is scarcely reproducible in the ACC morphological variants. In fact, specifically for the pure oncocytic neoplasms that seem to have a better prognosis in comparison to the conventional ACCs, a modified system (the Lin-Weiss-Bisceglia) has been proposed. With the aim to simplify the ACC diagnosis, 2 years ago, the ""reticulin"" diagnostic algorithm has been proposed, based on the observation that the tumoral reticulin framework (highlighted by reticulin silver-based histochemical staining) is consistently disrupted in malignant cases but only in a small subset of benign cases. Following this algorithm, in the presence of reticulin alterations, malignancy is further defined through the identification of at least one of the following parameters: necrosis, high mitotic rate, and venous invasion. As a complement to the morphological approach, some immunohistochemical markers (such as steroidogenic factor 1) have been proposed as diagnostic and prognostic adjuncts but still lack wide clinical validation.",1
21994901,"Prostate cancer, the most common male cancer in Western countries, is commonly detected with complex chromosomal rearrangements. Following the discovery of the recurrent TMPRSS2:ETS fusions in prostate cancer and EML4:ALK in non-small-cell lung cancer, it is now accepted that fusion genes not only are the hallmark of haematological malignancies and sarcomas, but also play an important role in epithelial cell carcinogenesis. However, previous studies aiming to identify fusion genes in prostate cancer were mainly focused on expression changes and fusion transcripts. To investigate the genes recurrently affected by the chromosome breakpoints in prostate cancer, we analysed Affymetrix array 6.0 and 500K SNP microarray data from 77 prostate cancer samples. While the two genes most frequently affected by genomic breakpoints were, as expected, ERG and TMPRSS2, surprisingly more known tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) than known oncogenes were identified at recurrent chromosome breakpoints. Certain well-characterised TSGs, including p53, PTEN, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are recurrently truncated as a result of chromosome rearrangements in prostate cancer. Interestingly, many of the genes residing at recurrent breakpoint sites have not yet been implicated in prostate carcinogenesis such as HOOK3, PPP2R2A and TCBA1. We have confirmed the generally reduced expression of selected genes in clinical samples using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Subsequently, we further investigated the genes associated with the t(4:6) translocation in LNCaP cells and reveal the genomic fusion of SNX9 and putative TSG UNC5C, which led to the reduced expression of both genes. This study reveals another common mechanism that leads to the inactivation of TSGs in prostate cancer and the identification of multiple TSGs inactivated by chromosome rearrangements will lead to new direction of research for the molecular basis of prostate carcinogenesis.",1
21979947,"Keratoconus is a condition in which the cornea progressively thins over time, and is a major cause for cornea transplantation. To identify keratoconus susceptibility regions, we performed a comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a discovery and replication design. A discovery panel of 222 keratoconus Caucasian patients and 3324 Caucasian controls was genotyped using Illumina 370K beadchips. Further associated and fine-mapping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (n= 4905) were genotyped in an independent replication case-control panel of 304 cases and 518 controls and a family panel of 307 subjects in 70 families. Logistic regression models implemented in PLINK were performed to test associations in case-control samples with and without principal component (PC) adjustments. Generalized estimation equation models accounting for familial correlations implemented in GWAF were used for association testing in families. No genome-wide associations were identified in the discovery GWAS panel. From the initial testing without adjustments for PCs, the top three SNPs located at 3p26 (rs6442925), 2q21.3 (rs4954218) and 19q13.3 (rs1428642) were identified with unadjusted P-values of 6.5 × 10(-8), 2.4 × 10(-7) and 3.1 × 10(-7), respectively. After adjustments for PCs, rs1428642 became the most significant through the genome with a P-value of 1.4 × 10(-6), while rs6442925 and rs4954218 were less significant (P= 1.9 × 10(-5) and 2.6 × 10(-4)). SNP rs4954218 was confirmed in two independent replication panels with P-values of 0.004 and 0.009, respectively. Meta-analysis revealed a highest association at rs4954218 with adjusted P= 1.6 × 10(-7) (unadjusted P= 1.2 × 10(-9)). These findings suggest SNP rs4954218, located near the RAB3GAP1 gene, previously reported to be associated with corneal malformation, is a potential susceptibility locus for keratoconus.",1
21969755,"Adverse drug reactions are very common during a systemic drug therapy. Most of these are fortunately mild or moderate and transient. Serious adverse drug reactions often lead to hospitalisation. Drug-drug interactions can also contribute substantially to differences in drug response. Drug-induced inhibition of drug metabolising enzymes is usually competitive and causes an increased exposure of the drug whose metabolism is inhibited. This usually results in a higher incidence of adverse drug reactions and an increased severity. Conversely enzyme induction increases the metabolic capacity thereby reducing the exposure of a drug with sometimes loss of drug effects (nonresponse). Detailed knowledge of the causative mechanisms will help detecting and avoiding severe adverse drug reactions.",0
21964575,"Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other gynecologic malignancy in developed countries. Sixteen million sequence variants, identified through whole-genome sequencing of 457 Icelanders, were imputed to 41,675 Icelanders genotyped using SNP chips, as well as to their relatives. Sequence variants were tested for association with ovarian cancer (N of affected individuals = 656). We discovered a rare (0.41% allelic frequency) frameshift mutation, c.2040_2041insTT, in the BRIP1 (FANCJ) gene that confers an increase in ovarian cancer risk (odds ratio (OR) = 8.13, P = 2.8 × 10(-14)). The mutation was also associated with increased risk of cancer in general and reduced lifespan by 3.6 years. In a Spanish population, another frameshift mutation in BRIP1, c.1702_1703del, was seen in 2 out of 144 subjects with ovarian cancer and 1 out of 1,780 control subjects (P = 0.016). This allele was also associated with breast cancer (seen in 6/927 cases; P = 0.0079). Ovarian tumors from heterozygous carriers of the Icelandic mutation show loss of the wild-type allele, indicating that BRIP1 behaves like a classical tumor suppressor gene in ovarian cancer.",1
21961650,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a lifelong psychiatric illness characterized by manic and depressive episodes affecting 1-5% of the general population. Among mood-stabilizing treatments, lithium represents the mainstay in the therapeutic management of BD. However, besides the relatively high rate of excellent responders, a significant fraction of patients present patterns of partial or nonresponse to lithium. This variability might be influenced by genetic factors, even though findings have so far been inconclusive. Here, we present the results of an exploratory genome-wide scan followed by extended genotyping carried out on a sample of 204 Sardinian BD patients characterized for lithium response.",0
21951562,"Metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a dismal prognosis. EGFR is overexpressed or mutated in a large proportion of cases. Downstream components of the EGFR pathway and crosstalk with the NF-κB pathway have not been examined at the clinical level. We explored the prognostic significance of the mRNA expression of nine genes in the EGFR and NF-κB pathways and of BRCA1 and RAP80 in patients in whom EGFR and K-ras gene status had previously been determined. In addition, NFKBIA and DUSP22 gene status was also determined.",1
21945885,"In complex organisms, different tissues express different genes, which ultimately shape the function and phenotype of each tissue. An important goal of modern biology is to understand how some genes are turned on and off in specific tissues and how the numbers of different gene expression products are determined. These aspects are named 'expression breadth' (or 'tissue specificity') and 'expression level', respectively. Here, we show that we can predict substantial amount of variation in levels and breadths of gene expression using genomic information of each gene. Interestingly, many genomic traits are correlated with both aspects of gene expression in similar directions, suggesting shared molecular pathways. However, to elucidate distinctive molecular mechanisms governing gene expression levels and breadths, we need to identify the relative significance of each genomic trait on these two aspects of gene expression. To this end, we developed a novel multivariate multiple regression method. Using this new method, we show that gene compactness (in particular, the mean size of exons), codon usage bias and non-synonymous rates have a stronger influence on expression levels compared with their effects on expression breadths. In contrast, the propensity of promoter DNA methylation is a stronger indicator of expression breadths than of expression levels. Interestingly, intron DNA methylation exhibits an opposite pattern to the promoter DNA methylation in the human genome, suggesting that DNA methylation may play multiple roles depending upon its genomic targets. Furthermore, synonymous rates have stronger associations with expression breadths than with expression levels in the human genome. These findings provide clues toward distinctive molecular mechanisms regulating different aspects of gene expression.",0
21910222,"Kleefstra syndrome (KS), previously known as the 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome (9qSTDS) is caused by haploinsufficiency of the EHMT1 gene. Both a single mutation and 9q34 microdeletions encompassing the entire gene can be responsible for this syndrome which is characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia, and typical dysmorphisms, and may be associated with congenital heart and/or renal defects and epilepsy. Its behavioral phenotype has recently been described and comprises particular sleep disturbances and apathy. In this report, the evolution of the behavioral profile of KS is outlined by the description of three female patients aged 19, 33, and 43 years, respectively. In two patients, the syndrome was caused by an intragenic mutation and in the third by a 9q34 microdeletion encompassing the EHMT1 gene. MRI scanning of the brain in the two eldest patients demonstrated multifocal subcortical signal abnormalities. In general, the severity of the behavioral and motor deficiencies increased over time and became apparent after adolescence. It is concluded that the ""regressive"" phenotype of KS seems to be associated with the EHMT1 gene in particular. In addition, the utility of uncritical use of a classificatory diagnostic approach is discussed in the context of the motor and motivational disturbances that are prominent in this syndrome.",1
21904853,"Mutations in the TET2 and ASXL1 genes have been described in approximately 14% and 8% of patients, respectively, with classic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), but their role as possible new diagnostic molecular markers is still inconclusive. In addition, other genes such as IDH1, IDH2, and c-CBL have also been reported in several myeloid neoplasms. We have studied the mutational status of TET2 (complete coding region), ASXL1 (exon12), IDH1 (R132), IDH2 (R140 and R172), and c-CBL (exons 8 and 9) in 62 MPN patients (52 essential thrombocythemia (ET), five polycythemia vera (PV), and five primary myelofibrosis (PMF)) negative for both JAK2 (V617F and exon 12) and MPL (exon 10) mutations. Pathogenic alterations in the TET2 gene were detected in three out 52 ET cases (4.8%). ASXL1 gene pathogenic mutations were also detected in three cases (two ET and one PMF). One ET patient harbored, simultaneously, one TET2 and one ASXL1 mutations. Mutations in the TET2 and ASXL1 genes showed no association with the JAK2 46/1 haplotype. Analysis of a JAK2V617F-positive cohort of 50 ET patients showed no mutations in either the TET2 or ASXL1 genes. Regarding IDH1, IDH2, and c-CBL genes, no mutations were found in any patient. In conclusion, TET2 and ASXL1 pathogenic mutations are found in 8% of MPN lacking JAK2 and MPL mutations, whereas IDH1, IDH2, and c-CBL mutations are not detected in this subset of patients.",1
21881048,"Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is one of the few B-cell lymphoma types that remain orphan of molecular lesions in cancer-related genes. Detection of active NF-κB signaling in 14 (58%) of 24 SMZLs prompted the investigation of NF-κB molecular alterations in 101 SMZLs. Mutations and copy number abnormalities of NF-κB genes occurred in 36 (36%) of 101 SMZLs and targeted both canonical (TNFAIP3 and IKBKB) and noncanonical (BIRC3, TRAF3, MAP3K14) NF-κB pathways. Most alterations were mutually exclusive, documenting the existence of multiple independent mechanisms affecting NF-κB in SMZL. BIRC3 inactivation in SMZL recurred because of somatic mutations that disrupted the same RING domain that in extranodal marginal zone lymphoma is removed by the t(11;18) translocation, which points to BIRC3 disruption as a common mechanism across marginal zone B-cell lymphomagenesis. Genetic lesions of NF-κB provide a molecular basis for the pathogenesis of more than 30% of SMZLs and offer a suitable target for NF-κB therapeutic approaches in this lymphoma.",1
21878963,"Gene evolution has long been thought to be primarily driven by duplication and rearrangement mechanisms. However, every evolutionary lineage harbours orphan genes that lack homologues in other lineages and whose evolutionary origin is only poorly understood. Orphan genes might arise from duplication and rearrangement processes followed by fast divergence; however, de novo evolution out of non-coding genomic regions is emerging as an important additional mechanism. This process appears to provide raw material continuously for the evolution of new gene functions, which can become relevant for lineage-specific adaptations.",0
21876681,"Our aim was to identify genes that influence the inverse association of coffee with the risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). We used genome-wide genotype data and lifetime caffeinated-coffee-consumption data on 1,458 persons with PD and 931 without PD from the NeuroGenetics Research Consortium (NGRC), and we performed a genome-wide association and interaction study (GWAIS), testing each SNP's main-effect plus its interaction with coffee, adjusting for sex, age, and two principal components. We then stratified subjects as heavy or light coffee-drinkers and performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) in each group. We replicated the most significant SNP. Finally, we imputed the NGRC dataset, increasing genomic coverage to examine the region of interest in detail. The primary analyses (GWAIS, GWAS, Replication) were performed using genotyped data. In GWAIS, the most significant signal came from rs4998386 and the neighboring SNPs in GRIN2A. GRIN2A encodes an NMDA-glutamate-receptor subunit and regulates excitatory neurotransmission in the brain. Achieving P(2df) = 10(-6), GRIN2A surpassed all known PD susceptibility genes in significance in the GWAIS. In stratified GWAS, the GRIN2A signal was present in heavy coffee-drinkers (OR = 0.43; P = 6×10(-7)) but not in light coffee-drinkers. The a priori Replication hypothesis that ""Among heavy coffee-drinkers, rs4998386_T carriers have lower PD risk than rs4998386_CC carriers"" was confirmed: OR(Replication) = 0.59, P(Replication) = 10(-3); OR(Pooled) = 0.51, P(Pooled) = 7×10(-8). Compared to light coffee-drinkers with rs4998386_CC genotype, heavy coffee-drinkers with rs4998386_CC genotype had 18% lower risk (P = 3×10(-3)), whereas heavy coffee-drinkers with rs4998386_TC genotype had 59% lower risk (P = 6×10(-13)). Imputation revealed a block of SNPs that achieved P(2df)<5×10(-8) in GWAIS, and OR = 0.41, P = 3×10(-8) in heavy coffee-drinkers. This study is proof of concept that inclusion of environmental factors can help identify genes that are missed in GWAS. Both adenosine antagonists (caffeine-like) and glutamate antagonists (GRIN2A-related) are being tested in clinical trials for treatment of PD. GRIN2A may be a useful pharmacogenetic marker for subdividing individuals in clinical trials to determine which medications might work best for which patients.",1
21852578,"Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome (NNS) is a disorder that segregates in an autosomal recessive fashion. Symptoms include periodic fever, skin rash, partial lipomuscular atrophy, and joint contracture. Here, we report a mutation in the human proteasome subunit beta type 8 gene (PSMB8) that encodes the immunoproteasome subunit β5i in patients with NNS. This G201V mutation disrupts the β-sheet structure, protrudes from the loop that interfaces with the β4 subunit, and is in close proximity to the catalytic threonine residue. The β5i mutant is not efficiently incorporated during immunoproteasome biogenesis, resulting in reduced proteasome activity and accumulation of ubiquitinated and oxidized proteins within cells expressing immunoproteasomes. As a result, the level of interleukin (IL)-6 and IFN-γ inducible protein (IP)-10 in patient sera is markedly increased. Nuclear phosphorylated p38 and the secretion of IL-6 are increased in patient cells both in vitro and in vivo, which may account for the inflammatory response and periodic fever observed in these patients. These results show that a mutation within a proteasome subunit is the direct cause of a human disease and suggest that decreased proteasome activity can cause inflammation.",1
21829660,"Genomic DNA sequences display compositional heterogeneity on many scales. In this paper we analyzed tendencies and anomalies in the occurence of mono, di and trinucleotides in structural regions of plant genes. Representation of these trends as a function of position along genic sequences highlighted compositional features peculiar of either monocots or eudicots that were remarkably uniform within these two evolutionary clades. The most evident of these features appeared in the form of gradient of base content along the direction of transcription. The robustness of such a representation was validated in sequences sub-datasets generated considering structural and compositional features such as total length of cds, overall GC content and genic orientation in the genome. Piecewise regression analyses indicated that the gradients could be conveniently approximated to a two segmented model where a first region featuring a steep slope is followed by a second segment fitting a milder variation. In general, monocots species showed steeper segments than eudicots. The guanine gradient was the most distinctive feature between the two evolutionary clades, being moderately increasing in eudicots and firmly decreasing in monocots. Single gene investigation revealed that a high proportion of genes show compositional trends compatible with a segmented model suggesting that these features are essential attributes of gene organization. Dinucleotide and trinucleotide biases were referred to expectation based on a random union of the component elements. The average bias at dinucleotide level identified a significant undererpresentation of some dinucleotide and the overrepresention of others. The bias at trinucleotide level was on average low. Finally, the analysis of bryophyte coding sequences showed mononucleotide, dinucleotide and trinucleotide compositional trends resembling those of higher plants. This finding suggested that the emergenge of compositional bias is an ancient event in evolution which was already present at the time of land conquest by green plants.",0
21826085,"We implemented a two-step approach to detect potential predictor gene variants for neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) in schizophrenic subjects. First, we screened associations by using a genome-wide (Illumina HumanHapCNV370) SNP array in 61 Japanese schizophrenia patients with treatment-resistant TD and 61 Japanese schizophrenia patients without TD. Next, we performed a replication analysis in 36 treatment-resistant TD and 138 non-TD subjects. An association of an SNP in the DPP6 (dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein-6) gene, rs6977820, the most promising association identified by the screen, was significant in the replication sample (allelic P=0.008 in the replication sample, allelic P=4.6 × 10(-6), odds ratio 2.32 in the combined sample). The SNP is located in intron-1 of the DPP6 gene and the risk allele was associated with decreased DPP6 gene expression in the human postmortem prefrontal cortex. Chronic administration of haloperidol increased Dpp6 expression in mouse brains. DPP6 is an auxiliary subunit of Kv4 and regulates the properties of Kv4, which regulates the activity of dopaminergic neurons. The findings of this study indicate that an altered response of Kv4/DPP6 to long-term neuroleptic administration is involved in neuroleptic-induced TD.",1
21824976,"Genome-wide and candidate-gene association studies of bladder cancer have identified 10 susceptibility loci thus far. We conducted a meta-analysis of two previously published genome-wide scans (4501 cases and 6076 controls of European background) and followed up the most significant association signals [17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 genomic regions] in 1382 cases and 2201 controls from four studies. A combined analysis adjusted for study center, age, sex, and smoking status identified a novel susceptibility locus that mapped to a region of 18q12.3, marked by rs7238033 (P = 8.7 × 10(-9); allelic odds ratio 1.20 with 95% CI: 1.13-1.28) and two highly correlated SNPs, rs10775480/rs10853535 (r(2)= 1.00; P = 8.9 × 10(-9); allelic odds ratio 1.16 with 95% CI: 1.10-1.22). The signal localizes to the solute carrier family 14 member 1 gene, SLC14A1, a urea transporter that regulates cellular osmotic pressure. In the kidney, SLC14A1 regulates urine volume and concentration whereas in erythrocytes it determines the Kidd blood groups. Our findings suggest that genetic variation in SLC14A1 could provide new etiological insights into bladder carcinogenesis.",1
21814517,"Asthma is a complex phenotype influenced by genetic and environmental factors. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 938 Japanese pediatric asthma patients and 2,376 controls. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing strong associations (P<1×10(-8)) in GWAS were further genotyped in an independent Japanese samples (818 cases and 1,032 controls) and in Korean samples (835 cases and 421 controls). SNP rs987870, located between HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1, was consistently associated with pediatric asthma in 3 independent populations (P(combined) = 2.3×10(-10), odds ratio [OR] = 1.40). HLA-DP allele analysis showed that DPA1*0201 and DPB1*0901, which were in strong linkage disequilibrium, were strongly associated with pediatric asthma (DPA1*0201: P = 5.5×10(-10), OR = 1.52, and DPB1*0901: P = 2.0×10(-7), OR = 1.49). Our findings show that genetic variants in the HLA-DP locus are associated with the risk of pediatric asthma in Asian populations.",1
21811802,"The experiments with transgenic plants frequently demand selection of promoters providing appropriate transcription patterns. The set of promoters commonly used in vectors and genetic constructs is very limited, and these promoters provide only a few variants of gene expression patterns. Moreover, identical promoters in a complex construct can induce transgene silencing. This problem can be solved using a variety of plant gene promoters with experimentally verified characteristics. However, this requires a time-consuming analysis of literature data. Here, we describe a database of plant promoters (TransGene Promoters, TGP;                             http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/dbases/tgp/home.html                                                     ).

21796119,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are the two most common non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). Here we sequenced tumour and matched normal DNA from 13 DLBCL cases and one FL case to identify genes with mutations in B-cell NHL. We analysed RNA-seq data from these and another 113 NHLs to identify genes with candidate mutations, and then re-sequenced tumour and matched normal DNA from these cases to confirm 109 genes with multiple somatic mutations. Genes with roles in histone modification were frequent targets of somatic mutation. For example, 32% of DLBCL and 89% of FL cases had somatic mutations in MLL2, which encodes a histone methyltransferase, and 11.4% and 13.4% of DLBCL and FL cases, respectively, had mutations in MEF2B, a calcium-regulated gene that cooperates with CREBBP and EP300 in acetylating histones. Our analysis suggests a previously unappreciated disruption of chromatin biology in lymphomagenesis.",1
21761138,"Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in developed countries. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified novel susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer. To follow up on these findings, and try to identify novel colorectal cancer susceptibility loci, we present results for GWAS of colorectal cancer (2,906 cases, 3,416 controls) that have not previously published main associations. Specifically, we calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using log-additive models for each study. In order to improve our power to detect novel colorectal cancer susceptibility loci, we performed a meta-analysis combining the results across studies. We selected the most statistically significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for replication using ten independent studies (8,161 cases and 9,101 controls). We again used a meta-analysis to summarize results for the replication studies alone, and for a combined analysis of GWAS and replication studies. We measured ten SNPs previously identified in colorectal cancer susceptibility loci and found eight to be associated with colorectal cancer (p value range 0.02 to 1.8 × 10(-8)). When we excluded studies that have previously published on these SNPs, five SNPs remained significant at p < 0.05 in the combined analysis. No novel susceptibility loci were significant in the replication study after adjustment for multiple testing, and none reached genome-wide significance from a combined analysis of GWAS and replication. We observed marginally significant evidence for a second independent SNP in the BMP2 region at chromosomal location 20p12 (rs4813802; replication p value 0.03; combined p value 7.3 × 10(-5)). In a region on 5p33.15, which includes the coding regions of the TERT-CLPTM1L genes and has been identified in GWAS to be associated with susceptibility to at least seven other cancers, we observed a marginally significant association with rs2853668 (replication p value 0.03; combined p value 1.9 × 10(-4)). Our study suggests a complex nature of the contribution of common genetic variants to risk for colorectal cancer.",1
21760593,"In order to identify acute myeloid leukemia (AML) CD34(+)-specific gene expression profiles, mononuclear cells from AML patients (n=46) were sorted into CD34(+) and CD34(-) subfractions, and genome-wide expression analysis was performed using Illumina BeadChip Arrays. AML CD34(+) and CD34(-) gene expression was compared with a large group of normal CD34(+) bone marrow (BM) cells (n=31). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis showed that CD34(+) AML samples belonged to a distinct cluster compared with normal BM and that in 61% of the cases the AML CD34(+) transcriptome did not cluster together with the paired CD34(-) transcriptome. The top 50 of AML CD34(+)-specific genes was selected by comparing the AML CD34(+) transcriptome with the AML CD34(-) and CD34(+) normal BM transcriptomes. Interestingly, for three of these genes, that is, ankyrin repeat domain 28 (ANKRD28), guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha 15 (GNA15) and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2 (UGP2), a high transcript level was associated with a significant poorer overall survival (OS) in two independent cohorts (n=163 and n=218) of normal karyotype AML. Importantly, the prognostic value of the continuous transcript levels of ANKRD28 (OS hazard ratio (HR): 1.32, P=0.008), GNA15 (OS HR: 1.22, P=0.033) and UGP2 (OS HR: 1.86, P=0.009) was shown to be independent from the well-known risk factors FLT3-ITD, NPM1c(+) and CEBPA mutation status.",1
21750109,"Three genome-wide association studies in Europe and the USA have reported eight urinary bladder cancer (UBC) susceptibility loci. Using extended case and control series and 1000 Genomes imputations of 5 340 737 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we searched for additional loci in the European GWAS. The discovery sample set consisted of 1631 cases and 3822 controls from the Netherlands and 603 cases and 37 781 controls from Iceland. For follow-up, we used 3790 cases and 7507 controls from 13 sample sets of European and Iranian ancestry. Based on the discovery analysis, we followed up signals in the urea transporter (UT) gene SLC14A. The strongest signal at this locus was represented by a SNP in intron 3, rs17674580, that reached genome-wide significance in the overall analysis of the discovery and follow-up groups: odds ratio = 1.17, P = 7.6 × 10(-11). SLC14A1 codes for UTs that define the Kidd blood group and are crucial for the maintenance of a constant urea concentration gradient in the renal medulla and, through this, the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. It is speculated that rs17674580, or other sequence variants in LD with it, indirectly modifies UBC risk by affecting urine production. If confirmed, this would support the 'urogenous contact hypothesis' that urine production and voiding frequency modify the risk of UBC.",1
21740922,"We conducted a case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) of human longevity, comparing 664,472 autosomal SNPs in 763 long-lived individuals (LLI; mean age: 99.7 years) and 1085 controls (mean age: 60.2 years) from Germany. Only one association, namely that of SNP rs4420638 near the APOC1 gene, achieved genome-wide significance (allele-based P=1.8×10(-10)). However, logistic regression analysis revealed that this association, which was replicated in an independent German sample, is fully explicable by linkage disequilibrium with the APOE allele ɛ4, the only variant hitherto established as a major genetic determinant of survival into old age. Our GWAS failed to identify any additional autosomal susceptibility genes. One explanation for this lack of success in our study would be that GWAS provide only limited statistical power for a polygenic phenotype with loci of small effect such as human longevity. A recent GWAS in Dutch LLI independently confirmed the APOE-longevity association, thus strengthening the conclusion that this locus is a very, if not the most, important genetic factor influencing longevity.",1
21718596,"Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the main treatment of advanced lung cancer. However, platinum resistance has become a major treatment obstacle. Novel therapies, particularly tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-TKI) and agents that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), have improved the treatment. Both chemotherapy and targeted therapy have their molecular mechanisms. This study aimed to determine the mutation, amplification, or expression status and interrelationships of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), K-Ras proto-oncogene, excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), and VEGF genes as well as their correlations to prognosis of large cell lung carcinoma (LCLC) after EGFR-targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and anti-VEGF therapy. EGFR and K-Ras mutations in 60 specimens of LCLC were detected by direct DNA sequencing. EGFR, ERCC1, and VEGF protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). EGFR gene copy number was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). One (1.7%) patient had an EGFR L858M point mutation in exon 21, 3 (5.0%) had K-Ras mutations, and 10 (19.6%) had EGFR amplification (FISH positive). Positive rates of EGFR, ERCC1, and VEGF proteins were 38.3%, 56.7%, and 70.0%, respectively. EGFR amplification was positively correlated to EGFR protein expression (r = 0.390, P = 0.005). The positive rate of VEGF protein was significantly higher in patients with lymph node metastasis than in those without (84.6% vs. 58.8%, P = 0.046). No significant correlations were observed among the EGFR, K-Ras, ERCC1, and VEGF genes. EGFR gene amplification and the low rate of EGFR mutation suggest that patients with LCLC are likely to obtain little benefit from anti-EGFR therapies.",1
21700265,"The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), a commonly performed test of the acute phase response, is the rate at which erythrocytes sediment in vitro in 1 hr. The molecular basis of erythrocyte sedimentation is unknown. To identify genetic variants associated with ESR, we carried out a genome-wide association study of 7607 patients in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. The discovery cohort consisted of 1979 individuals from the Mayo Clinic, and the replication cohort consisted of 5628 individuals from the remaining four eMERGE sites. A nonsynonymous SNP, rs6691117 (Val→IIe), in the complement receptor 1 gene (CR1) was associated with ESR (discovery cohort p = 7 × 10(-12), replication cohort p = 3 × 10(-14), combined cohort p = 9 × 10(-24)). We imputed 61 SNPs in CR1, and a ""possibly damaging"" SNP (rs2274567, His→Arg) in linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 0.74) with rs6691117 was also associated with ESR (discovery p = 5 × 10(-11), replication p = 7 × 10(-17), and combined cohort p = 2 × 10(-25)). The two nonsynonymous SNPs in CR1 are near the C3b/C4b binding site, suggesting a possible mechanism by which the variants may influence ESR. In conclusion, genetic variation in CR1, which encodes a protein that clears complement-tagged inflammatory particles from the circulation, influences interindividual variation in ESR, highlighting an association between the innate immunity pathway and erythrocyte interactions.",0
21687954,"Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Aberrance of the two oncogenes MET and SOX2 are frequently encountered in NSCLC. Exons 18 through 21 of the EGFR gene were screened and MET and SOX2 immunostaining was conducted to analyze the immunohistological staining of MET and SOX2 and the EGFR mutation status. One hundred and fifty tissue samples were examined including 57 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), 80 adenocarcinomas (ADCs), 9 adenosquamous carcinomas (ADSCs) and 4 large cell carcinomas (LCCs). The 32 NSCLCs harboring an EGFR mutation included 28 ADCs, 3 SCCs and 1 ADSC. A higher level of SOX2 expression appeared in NSCLCs without the EGFR mutation compared to those with EGFR mutation (χ2=9.02, P=0.0027). Of the 28 ADCs, 24 (85.7%) with an EGFR mutation showed low level of SOX2 expression. ADCs with deletion in exon 19 overexpressed MET and showed low levels of SOX2. SOX2 expression was inversely correlated to the expression of MET in NSCLC and mainly present in non-mutated NSCLC (r=-0.42, P<0.0001). There was a tendency for SOX2 to be expressed in SCCs and particularly in the part of SCC among ADSCs, whereas MET was mainly expressed in the part of ADC among ADSCs and ADCs. High level of MET and SOX2 expression were respectively demonstrated in ADCs and SCCs; MET activation was accompanied with exon 19 deletion in ADCs. EGFR and MET coordinate to drive tumorigenesis. Detection of the activation of MET and EGFR may be used for targeted drug therapy.",1
21676251,"Lysozyme c (chicken-type lysozyme) has an important role in host defense, and has been extensively studied as a model in molecular biology, enzymology, protein chemistry, and crystallography. Traditionally, lysozyme c has been considered to be part of a small family that includes genes for two other proteins, lactalbumin, which is found only in mammals, and calcium-binding lysozyme, which is found in only a few species of birds and mammals. More recently, additional testes-expressed members of this family have been identified in human and mouse, suggesting that the mammalian lysozyme gene family is larger than previously known.",1

21671394,"Kabuki syndrome is a rare, multiple malformation disorder characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, cardiac anomalies, skeletal abnormalities, and mild to moderate intellectual disability. Simplex cases make up the vast majority of the reported cases with Kabuki syndrome, but parent-to-child transmission in more than a half-dozen instances indicates that it is an autosomal dominant disorder. We recently reported that Kabuki syndrome is caused by mutations in MLL2, a gene that encodes a Trithorax-group histone methyltransferase, a protein important in the epigenetic control of active chromatin states. Here, we report on the screening of 110 families with Kabuki syndrome. MLL2 mutations were found in 81/110 (74%) of families. In simplex cases for which DNA was available from both parents, 25 mutations were confirmed to be de novo, while a transmitted MLL2 mutation was found in two of three familial cases. The majority of variants found to cause Kabuki syndrome were novel nonsense or frameshift mutations that are predicted to result in haploinsufficiency. The clinical characteristics of MLL2 mutation-positive cases did not differ significantly from MLL2 mutation-negative cases with the exception that renal anomalies were more common in MLL2 mutation-positive cases. These results are important for understanding the phenotypic consequences of MLL2 mutations for individuals and their families as well as for providing a basis for the identification of additional genes for Kabuki syndrome.",1
21618603,"Nonsyndromic cleft palate (CP) is a common birth defect with a complex and heterogeneous etiology involving both genetic and environmental risk factors. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 550 case-parent trios, ascertained through a CP case collected in an international consortium. Family-based association tests of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and three common maternal exposures (maternal smoking, alcohol consumption, and multivitamin supplementation) were used in a combined 2 df test for gene (G) and gene-environment (G × E) interaction simultaneously, plus a separate 1 df test for G × E interaction alone. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate effects on risk to exposed and unexposed children. While no SNP achieved genome-wide significance when considered alone, markers in several genes attained or approached genome-wide significance when G × E interaction was included. Among these, MLLT3 and SMC2 on chromosome 9 showed multiple SNPs resulting in an increased risk if the mother consumed alcohol during the peri-conceptual period (3 months prior to conception through the first trimester). TBK1 on chr. 12 and ZNF236 on chr. 18 showed multiple SNPs associated with higher risk of CP in the presence of maternal smoking. Additional evidence of reduced risk due to G × E interaction in the presence of multivitamin supplementation was observed for SNPs in BAALC on chr. 8. These results emphasize the need to consider G × E interaction when searching for genes influencing risk to complex and heterogeneous disorders, such as nonsyndromic CP.",1
21618342,"We performed a mutational analysis of the 19 disintegrin-metalloproteinases (ADAMs) genes in human cutaneous metastatic melanoma and identified eight to be somatically mutated in 79 samples, affecting 34% of the melanoma tumors analyzed. Functional analysis of the two frequently mutated ADAM genes, ADAM29 and ADAM7 demonstrated that the mutations affect adhesion of melanoma cells to specific extracellular matrix proteins and in some cases increase their migration ability. This suggests that mutated ADAM genes could play a role in melanoma progression.",1
21615186,"Some 12 years ago, a polymorphism of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene became the first genetic element shown to impact substantially on human physical performance. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) exists not just as an endocrine regulator, but also within local tissue and cells, where it serves a variety of functions. Functional genetic polymorphic variants have been identified for most components of RAS, of which the best known and studied is a polymorphism of the ACE gene. The ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism has been associated with improvements in performance and exercise duration in a variety of populations. The I allele has been consistently demonstrated to be associated with endurance-orientated events, notably, in triathlons. Meanwhile, the D allele is associated with strength- and power-orientated performance, and has been found in significant excess among elite swimmers. Exceptions to these associations do exist, and are discussed. In theory, associations with ACE genotype may be due to functional variants in nearby loci, and/or related genetic polymorphism such as the angiotensin receptor, growth hormone and bradykinin genes. Studies of growth hormone gene variants have not shown significant associations with performance in studies involving both triathletes and military recruits. The angiotensin type-1 receptor has two functional polymorphisms that have not been shown to be associated with performance, although studies of hypoxic ascent have yielded conflicting results. ACE genotype influences bradykinin levels, and a common gene variant in the bradykinin 2 receptor exists. The high kinin activity haplotye has been associated with increased endurance performance at an Olympic level, and similar results of metabolic efficiency have been demonstrated in triathletes. Whilst the ACE genotype is associated with overall performance ability, at a single organ level, the ACE genotype and related polymorphism have significant associations. In cardiac muscle, ACE genotype has associations with left ventricular mass changes in response to stimulus, in both the health and diseased states. The D allele is associated with an exaggerated response to training, and the I allele with the lowest cardiac growth response. In light of the I-allele association with endurance performance, it seems likely that other regulatory mechanisms exist. Similarly in skeletal muscle, the D allele is associated with greater strength gains in response to training, in both healthy individuals and chronic disease states. As in overall performance, those genetic polymorphisms related to the ACE genotype, such as the bradykinin 2 gene, also influence skeletal muscle strength. Finally, the ACE genotype may influence metabolic efficiency, and elite mountaineers have demonstrated an excess of I alleles and I/I genotype frequency in comparison to controls. Interestingly, this was not seen in amateur climbers. Corroboratory evidence exists among high-altitude settlements in both South America and India, where the I allele exists in greater frequency in those who migrated from the lowlands. Unfortunately, if the ACE genotype does influence metabolic efficiency, associations with peak maximal oxygen consumption have yet to be rigorously demonstrated. The ACE genotype is an important but single factor in the determinant of sporting phenotype. Much of the mechanisms underlying this remain unexplored despite 12 years of research.",1
21612516,"Long-living individuals (LLIs) are used to study exceptional longevity. A number of genetic variants have been found associated in LLIs to date, but further identification of variants would improve knowledge on the mechanisms regulating the rate of aging. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study on 410 LLIs and 553 young control individuals with a 317K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip to identify novel traits associated with aging. Among the top (p < 1 × 10(-4)) SNPs initially identified, we found rs10491334 (CAMKIV) (odds ratio [OR] = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-0.73; p = 2.88 × 10(-5)), a variant previously reported associated with diastolic blood pressure, associated also in a replication set of 116 LLIs and 160 controls (OR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.32-0.90; p = 9 × 10(-3)). Furthermore, in vitro analysis established that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMKIV) activates the survival proteins AKT, SIRT1, and FOXO3A, and we found that homozygous carriers of rs10491334 have a significant reduction in CAMKIV expression. This, together with the observed reduction in minor-allele carriers among centenarians, points to a detrimental role for the SNP. In conclusion, prolongevity genes are activated by CAMKIV, the levels of which are influenced by rs10491334, a SNP associated with human longevity.",1
21573128,"Osteoporosis is a common disease characterized by low bone mass, decreased bone quality and increased predisposition to fracture. Genetic factors have been implicated in its etiology; however, the specific genes related to susceptibility to osteoporosis are not entirely known. To detect susceptibility genes for osteoporosis, we conducted a genome-wide association study in Japanese using ∼270,000 SNPs in 1,747 subjects (190 cases and 1,557 controls) followed by multiple levels of replication of the association using a total of ∼5,000 subjects (2,092 cases and 3,114 controls). Through these staged association studies followed by resequencing and linkage disequilibrium mapping, we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs7605378 associated with osteoporosis. (combined P = 1.51×10(-8), odds ratio = 1.25). This SNP is in a previously unknown gene on chromosome 2q33.1, FONG. FONG is predicted to encode a 147 amino-acid protein with a formiminotransferase domain in its N-terminal (FTCD_N domain) and is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues including bone. Our findings would give a new insight into osteoporosis etiology and pathogenesis.",1
21528268,"Cell cycle regulators have recently been implicated in oncogenic transformation of cells, including the cyclins active in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and their respective cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) whose activities are regulated by a set of inhibitors of CDK (CDKI). Since CDKIs can inhibit cell proliferation, they may have a role as tumor suppressor genes. To determine if alterations of CDKI genes may be involved in tumorigenesis of breast cancer, we examined the mutational status of p16(INK4A), p15(INK4B), p18(INK4C), p19(INK4D) CDKI genes in 36 primary breast carcinomas and 9 breast cancer cell lines using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), direct DNA sequencing, and Southern blot analysis. Furthermore, amplification of cyclin D1, D2, D3 genes were also examined in these samples. One mutation of p15(INK4B) gene occurred, resulting in change of aspartic acid to asparagine at codon 85. Since aspartic acid at this position is conserved between all four human and murine INK4 proteins, this missense mutation may have functional significance. The sample with a p15(INK4B) point mutation was accompanied by amplification of the cyclin D1 gene. A deletion of the p18(INK4C) gene was found in a primary tumor. Three deletions of the p16(INK4A) gene and two deletions of the p15(INK4B) gene were found in the cell lines. Also, we found amplification of the p15(INK4B) and p16(INK4A) loci in a clinical sample as well as amplification of the p19(INK4D) in another sample, and amplification of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene in one cell line and two primary tumors. We suspect that a critical gene for breast cancer is amplified near the MPO gene. These data indicate that CDKI mutations are moderately rare in breast cancer and are often associated with the simultaneous alteration of more than one cell-cycle regulatory gene.",1
21521612,"Major depression (MD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and a leading cause of loss in work productivity. A combination of genetic and environmental risk factors probably contributes to MD. We present data from a genome-wide association study revealing a neuron-specific neutral amino acid transporter (SLC6A15) as a susceptibility gene for MD. Risk allele carrier status in humans and chronic stress in mice were associated with a downregulation of the expression of this gene in the hippocampus, a brain region implicated in the pathophysiology of MD. The same polymorphisms also showed associations with alterations in hippocampal volume and neuronal integrity. Thus, decreased SLC6A15 expression, due to genetic or environmental factors, might alter neuronal circuits related to the susceptibility for MD. Our convergent data from human genetics, expression studies, brain imaging, and animal models suggest a pathophysiological mechanism for MD that may be accessible to drug targeting.",1
21512767,"Understanding how cancer genes are mutated in individual tumors is an important issue with potential clinical and therapeutic impact. This is especially relevant with recently developed targeted therapies since mutated genes can be targets and/or predictors. However, to date, gene mutation profiling in individual tumors is still underexplored. Breast cancer is composed of various subtypes. We presumed that this heterogeneity reflected the involvement of different molecular mechanisms including gene mutations that affect defined signaling pathways. Unlike the majority of published mutational studies, this study was aimed to draw a mutation profile in individual tumors by screening a panel of cancer genes in the same tumor. Thus, five genes frequently mutated in breast cancers: TP53, PIK3CA, PTEN, CDH1, and AKT1 were screened in each of 120 human primary breast tumors. Mutations in at least one of these genes were found in 62.5% of the tumors, of which the majority carried a single-gene mutation. Interestingly, a substantial proportion of tumors carried mutations either in TP53 or in genes of the PI3K pathway (PIK3CA or PTEN or AKT1). These two distinct mutation patterns were significantly associated to hormone receptor expression but independent of HER2 status.",1
21505073,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a typical complex trait and the major cause of chronic inflammation worldwide. Although multiple genetic loci have been shown for their association with the onset of RA, they cover only a part of its genetic components and are largely ethnicity-specific. To identify novel genetic factors related to the predisposition and prognosis of RA in Japanese, we conducted a large-scale genome-wide association (GWA) study. We performed a GWA analysis by scanning the genome of 1247 RA cases and 1486 controls for 277 420 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), followed by replication analysis using two independent sample sets consisting of 1865 cases and 1623 controls, and 2303 cases and 3380 controls. We identified two SNPs, rs2075876 and rs760426, in intron of the autoimmune regulator AIRE gene at chromosome 21q22 that showed strong associations with the disease (P= 3.6 × 10(-9) and P= 4.4 × 10(-8), respectively). Rs1800250, in exon7 of AIRE, was in strong linkage disequilibrium (r(2)= 0.94) with rs2075876 and introduced an amino acid alteration (S278R) in the SAND domain of the AIRE protein. In silico analysis showed the decreased transcription of AIRE by the risk allele of rs2075876 compared with the alternative allele (P= 6.8 × 10(-5)). No correlation was observed between the rs2075876 genotype and quantitative traits reflecting the progression of RA. As AIRE is a key molecule which regulates the expression and presentation of self-antigens in thymic negative selection, its downregulation by genetic polymorphisms may result in the survival of auto-reactive T cells to trigger auto-inflammation in RA.",1
21504050,"Mutations in the DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1, and IDH2 genes carry prognostic significance and occur frequently in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Leukemic mutations in all four genes have recently been implicated in aberrant DNA methylation, a hallmark of neoplasia. We previously reported that IDH1 mutations were absent, whereas TET2 mutations were present in 6%, of pediatric AML patients; in the present study, we determined the prevalence of DNMT3A and IDH2 mutations in pediatric AML.",1
21503581,"Salivary gland tumours are rare tumours characterized by histopathologic complexity and a wide variety of morphologic features. Studies on genetic changes in different histological subtypes of salivary gland tumours are important to better understand molecular pathogenetic mechanisms and to identify diagnostic and prognostic markers. Data are even more scanty dealing with unusual subtypes of these tumours. The aim of the present study was to analyse two high grade transformation adenoid cystic carcinomas (hgACC) and one hybrid tumour in order to identify, by mutational and microsatellite analysis, genetic alterations in TP53, CDKN2A/ARF, RAS, BRAF, PTEN, MAPK2 and EGFR genes. The two hgACCs showed snps missense in RAS genes and alterations with allelic instability in CDKN2A/ARF; moreover, a double mutation in TP53 was detected in one case. The hybrid tumour showed alterations in CDKN2A/ARF gene and snps missense in NRAS genes. Our data suggest that CDKN2A/ARF pathway might be involved in pathogenesis of the salivary gland tumours analysed. Further molecular analyses of these very rare tumours are necessary to better understand the role of other genetic alterations detected in our study.",1
21502949,"The caudate is a subcortical brain structure implicated in many common neurological and psychiatric disorders. To identify specific genes associated with variations in caudate volume, structural magnetic resonance imaging and genome-wide genotypes were acquired from two large cohorts, the Alzheimer's Disease NeuroImaging Initiative (ADNI; N=734) and the Brisbane Adolescent/Young Adult Longitudinal Twin Study (BLTS; N=464). In a preliminary analysis of heritability, around 90% of the variation in caudate volume was due to genetic factors. We then conducted genome-wide association to find common variants that contribute to this relatively high heritability. Replicated genetic association was found for the right caudate volume at single-nucleotide polymorphism rs163030 in the ADNI discovery sample (P=2.36 × 10⁻⁶) and in the BLTS replication sample (P=0.012). This genetic variation accounted for 2.79 and 1.61% of the trait variance, respectively. The peak of association was found in and around two genes, WDR41 and PDE8B, involved in dopamine signaling and development. In addition, a previously identified mutation in PDE8B causes a rare autosomal-dominant type of striatal degeneration. Searching across both samples offers a rigorous way to screen for genes consistently influencing brain structure at different stages of life. Variants identified here may be relevant to common disorders affecting the caudate.",1
21502063,"The concept of quality by design (QbD) reflects the current global regulatory thinking related to pharmaceutical products. A cornerstone of the QbD paradigm is the concept of a design space, where the design space is a multidimensional combination of input variables and process parameters that have been demonstrated to provide the assurance of product quality. If a design space can be established for a pharmaceutical process or product, then operation within the design space confirms that the product or process output possesses the required quality attributes. This concept of design space can be applied to the safety (leachables) assessment of drug products manufactured and stored in packaging systems. Critical variables in such a design space would include those variables that affect the interaction of the drug product and its packaging, including (a) composition of the drug product, (b) composition of the packaging system, (c) configuration of the packaging system, and (d) the conditions of contact. This paper proposes and justifies such a leachables design space for aqueous drug products packaged in a specific plastic packaging system. Such a design space has the following boundaries:Aqueous drug products with a pH in the range of 2 to 8 and that contain no polarity-impacting agents such as organic solubilizers and stabilizers (addressing variable a). Packaging systems manufactured from materials that meet the system's existing material specifications (addressing variable b). Nominal fill volumes from 50 to 1000 mL (addressing variable c). Products subjected to terminal sterilization and then stored at room temperature for a period of up to 24 months (addressing variable d). The ramification of such a design space is that any drug product that falls within these boundaries is deemed to be compatible with the packaging system, from the perspective of safety, without the requirement of supporting drug product testing.",0

21471458,"Alcohol consumption is a moderately heritable trait, but the genetic basis in humans is largely unknown, despite its clinical and societal importance. We report a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of ∼2.5 million directly genotyped or imputed SNPs with alcohol consumption (gram per day per kilogram body weight) among 12 population-based samples of European ancestry, comprising 26,316 individuals, with replication genotyping in an additional 21,185 individuals. SNP rs6943555 in autism susceptibility candidate 2 gene (AUTS2) was associated with alcohol consumption at genome-wide significance (P = 4 × 10(-8) to P = 4 × 10(-9)). We found a genotype-specific expression of AUTS2 in 96 human prefrontal cortex samples (P = 0.026) and significant (P < 0.017) differences in expression of AUTS2 in whole-brain extracts of mice selected for differences in voluntary alcohol consumption. Down-regulation of an AUTS2 homolog caused reduced alcohol sensitivity in Drosophila (P < 0.001). Our finding of a regulator of alcohol consumption adds knowledge to our understanding of genetic mechanisms influencing alcohol drinking behavior.",1
21464306,"Perrault syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by ovarian dysgenesis and sensorineural hearing loss. In a nonconsanguineous family with five affected siblings, linkage analysis and genomic sequencing revealed the genetic basis of Perrault syndrome to be compound heterozygosity for mutations in the mitochondrial histidyl tRNA synthetase HARS2 at two highly conserved amino acids, L200V and V368L. The nucleotide substitution creating HARS2 p.L200V also created an alternate splice leading to deletion of 12 codons from the HARS2 message. Affected family members thus carried three mutant HARS2 transcripts. Aminoacylation activity of HARS2 p.V368L and HARS2 p.L200V was reduced and the deletion mutant was not stably expressed in mammalian mitochondria. In yeast, lethality of deletion of the single essential histydyl tRNA synthetase HTS1 was fully rescued by wild-type HTS1 and by HTS1 p.L198V (orthologous to HARS2 p.L200V), partially rescued by HTS1 p.V381L (orthologous to HARS2 p.V368L), and not rescued by the deletion mutant. In Caenorhabditis elegans, reduced expression by RNAi of the single essential histydyl tRNA synthetase hars-1 severely compromised fertility. Together, these data suggest that Perrault syndrome in this family was caused by reduction of HARS2 activity. These results implicate aberrations of mitochondrial translation in mammalian gonadal dysgenesis. More generally, the relationship between HARS2 and Perrault syndrome illustrates how causality may be demonstrated for extremely rare inherited mutations in essential, highly conserved genes.",1
21460842,"Uterine fibroids are a common benign tumor of the female genital tract. We conducted a genome-wide association study in which 457,044 SNPs were analyzed in 1,607 individuals with clinically diagnosed uterine fibroids and 1,428 female controls. SNPs showing suggestive associations (P < 5 × 10(-5)) were further genotyped in 3,466 additional cases and 3,245 female controls. Three loci on chromosomes 10q24.33, 22q13.1 and 11p15.5 revealed genome-wide significant associations with uterine fibroids. The SNPs showing the most significant association in a combination analysis at each of these loci were rs7913069 (P = 8.65 × 10(-14), odds ratio (OR) = 1.47), rs12484776 (P = 2.79 × 10(-12), OR = 1.23) and rs2280543 (P = 3.82 × 10(-12), OR = 1.39), respectively. Subsequent fine mapping of these regions will be necessary to pinpoint the causal variants. Our findings should shed light on the pathogenesis of uterine fibroids.",1
21445902,"The need for a revised curriculum within the life sciences has been well-established. One strategy to improve student preparation in the life sciences is to redesign introductory courses like biology, chemistry, and physics so that they better reflect their disciplinary interdependence. We describe a medically relevant, context-based approach to teaching second semester general chemistry that demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of biology and chemistry. Our innovative method provides a model in which disciplinary barriers are diminished early in the undergraduate science curriculum. The course is divided into three principle educational modules: 1) Fundamentals of General Chemistry, 2) Medical Approaches to Inflammation, and 3) Neuroscience as a connector of chemistry, biology, and psychology. We accurately anticipated that this modified approach to teaching general chemistry would enhance student interest in chemistry and bridge the perceived gaps between biology and chemistry. The course serves as a template for context-based, interdisciplinary teaching that lays the foundation needed to train 21st century scientists.",0
21436454,"Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments can restrain antitumor immunity, particularly in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Because CD40 activation can reverse immune suppression and drive antitumor T cell responses, we tested the combination of an agonist CD40 antibody with gemcitabine chemotherapy in a small cohort of patients with surgically incurable PDA and observed tumor regressions in some patients. We reproduced this treatment effect in a genetically engineered mouse model of PDA and found unexpectedly that tumor regression required macrophages but not T cells or gemcitabine. CD40-activated macrophages rapidly infiltrated tumors, became tumoricidal, and facilitated the depletion of tumor stroma. Thus, cancer immune surveillance does not necessarily depend on therapy-induced T cells; rather, our findings demonstrate a CD40-dependent mechanism for targeting tumor stroma in the treatment of cancer.",1
21403518,"Protein expression and gene mutational status of KIT and PDGFRA were investigated in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of 14 ipsilateral testicular seminomas. The analysis was performed by ordinary immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction-direct sequencing methods. The genetic analysis was performed in exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 of KIT gene and in exons 12 and 18 of PDGFRA gene. Six point mutations of 5 types of KIT gene were recognized in 5 (36%) cases; exon 17 around codon 816 was a hotspot. The mutation sites of KIT gene were as follows: codon 557 in exon 11 (1 case), codon 816 in exon 17 (3 cases), codon 820 in exon 17 (1 case), and codon 822 in exon 17 (1 case). One patient showed multiple mutations of KIT gene. Immunoreactive KIT was recognized in 13 (93%) cases; the expression was strong in the 5 KIT mutation-positive cases, but variable or none in the 9 KIT mutation-negative cases. No PDGFRA gene mutations were observed in all the 14 cases. PDGFRA protein expression was weakly recognized in 12 cases but none in the remaining 2 cases. These data suggest, in testicular seminomas, that 36% of ipsilateral testicular seminomas have KIT mutations, KIT mutations are frequent around codon 816 of exon 17, multiple KIT mutations may be present, KIT expression is stronger in KIT mutation-positive cases than negative cases, PDGFRA gene mutations are absent, and PDGFRA protein is weakly expressed.",1
21395642,"Fungi produce a multitude of low-molecular-mass compounds known as secondary metabolites, which have roles in a range of cellular processes such as transcription, development and intercellular communication. In addition, many of these compounds now have important applications, for instance, as antibiotics or immunosuppressants. Genome mining efforts indicate that the capability of fungi to produce secondary metabolites has been substantially underestimated because many of the fungal secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters are silent under standard cultivation conditions. In this Review, I describe our current understanding of the regulatory elements that modulate the transcription of genes involved in secondary metabolism. I also discuss how an improved knowledge of these regulatory elements will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the physiological and ecological functions of these important compounds and will pave the way for a novel avenue to drug discovery through targeted activation of silent gene clusters.",0
21382095,"The aim of this study was to establish the frequency of amplification of tyrosine kinase receptor genes PDGFRA, KIT and KDR (VEGFR2) at 4q12 in glioblastomas at a population level, and to assess whether such alterations have any clinical impact. Screening of 390 glioblastomas from a population-based study by differential PCR revealed amplification of the PDGFRA, KIT and KDR genes in 33 (8.5%), 17 (4.4%) and 13 (3.3%) glioblastomas, respectively. None of these alterations was prognostic for overall survival. Patients with glioblastoma showing KIT amplification were significantly younger than those with glioblastoma showing no amplification (51.7 ± 21.7 years vs. 59.3 ± 13.1 years; P=0.0231). Twelve glioblastomas showed concurrent amplification of the PDGFRA, KIT and KDR genes, whereas 18 glioblastomas showed PDGFRA amplification only. A significant inverse association was observed between KIT amplification and EGFR amplification (P=0.0260), whereas a borderline positive association was found between KIT amplification and TP53 mutation (P=0.0579). No significant difference was observed in the frequency of amplification of these genes in primary and secondary glioblastomas or in glioblastomas with and without IDH1 mutations, suggesting that amplification of PDGFRA, KIT and KDR may be implicated in the pathogenesis of a small fraction of both subtypes of glioblastoma.",1
21378095,"The prevalence of hypertension in African Americans (AAs) is higher than in other US groups; yet, few have performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in AA. Among people of European descent, GWASs have identified genetic variants at 13 loci that are associated with blood pressure. It is unknown if these variants confer susceptibility in people of African ancestry. Here, we examined genome-wide and candidate gene associations with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) using the Candidate Gene Association Resource (CARe) consortium consisting of 8591 AAs. Genotypes included genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data utilizing the Affymetrix 6.0 array with imputation to 2.5 million HapMap SNPs and candidate gene SNP data utilizing a 50K cardiovascular gene-centric array (ITMAT-Broad-CARe [IBC] array). For Affymetrix data, the strongest signal for DBP was rs10474346 (P= 3.6 × 10(-8)) located near GPR98 and ARRDC3. For SBP, the strongest signal was rs2258119 in C21orf91 (P= 4.7 × 10(-8)). The top IBC association for SBP was rs2012318 (P= 6.4 × 10(-6)) near SLC25A42 and for DBP was rs2523586 (P= 1.3 × 10(-6)) near HLA-B. None of the top variants replicated in additional AA (n = 11 882) or European-American (n = 69 899) cohorts. We replicated previously reported European-American blood pressure SNPs in our AA samples (SH2B3, P= 0.009; TBX3-TBX5, P= 0.03; and CSK-ULK3, P= 0.0004). These genetic loci represent the best evidence of genetic influences on SBP and DBP in AAs to date. More broadly, this work supports that notion that blood pressure among AAs is a trait with genetic underpinnings but also with significant complexity.",1
21358633,"Studies into disorders of extreme growth failure (for example, Seckel syndrome and Majewski osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II) have implicated fundamental cellular processes of DNA damage response signaling and centrosome function in the regulation of human growth. Here we report that mutations in ORC1, encoding a subunit of the origin recognition complex, cause microcephalic primordial dwarfism resembling Meier-Gorlin syndrome. We establish that these mutations disrupt known ORC1 functions including pre-replicative complex formation and origin activation. ORC1 deficiency perturbs S-phase entry and S-phase progression. Additionally, we show that Orc1 depletion in zebrafish is sufficient to markedly reduce body size during rapid embryonic growth. Our data suggest a model in which ORC1 mutations impair replication licensing, slowing cell cycle progression and consequently impeding growth during development, particularly at times of rapid proliferation. These findings establish a novel mechanism for the pathogenesis of microcephalic dwarfism and show a surprising but important developmental impact of impaired origin licensing.",1
21355061,"Identification of genetic risk factors for albuminuria may alter strategies for early prevention of CKD progression, particularly among patients with diabetes. Little is known about the influence of common genetic variants on albuminuria in both general and diabetic populations. We performed a meta-analysis of data from 63,153 individuals of European ancestry with genotype information from genome-wide association studies (CKDGen Consortium) and from a large candidate gene study (CARe Consortium) to identify susceptibility loci for the quantitative trait urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and the clinical diagnosis microalbuminuria. We identified an association between a missense variant (I2984V) in the CUBN gene, which encodes cubilin, and both UACR (P = 1.1 × 10(-11)) and microalbuminuria (P = 0.001). We observed similar associations among 6981 African Americans in the CARe Consortium. The associations between this variant and both UACR and microalbuminuria were significant in individuals of European ancestry regardless of diabetes status. Finally, this variant associated with a 41% increased risk for the development of persistent microalbuminuria during 20 years of follow-up among 1304 participants with type 1 diabetes in the prospective DCCT/EDIC Study. In summary, we identified a missense CUBN variant that associates with levels of albuminuria in both the general population and in individuals with diabetes.",1

Faced with the exponential growth of publications avaliable and number of genes involved in a study, this task is becoming particularly difficult to achieve.",0
21347319,"Hyperplastic Polyposis Syndrome (HPS) is a condition associated with multiple serrated polyps, and an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). At least half of CRCs arising in HPS show a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), potentially linked to aberrant DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity. CIMP is associated with methylation of tumor suppressor genes including regulators of DNA mismatch repair (such as MLH1, MGMT), and negative regulators of Wnt signaling (such as WIF1). In this study, we investigated the potential for interaction of genetic and epigenetic variation in DNMT genes, in the aetiology of HPS.",1
21347284,"The PR interval on the electrocardiogram reflects atrial and atrioventricular nodal conduction time. The PR interval is heritable, provides important information about arrhythmia risk, and has been suggested to differ among human races. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified common genetic determinants of the PR interval in individuals of European and Asian ancestry, but there is a general paucity of GWA studies in individuals of African ancestry. We performed GWA studies in African American individuals from four cohorts (n = 6,247) to identify genetic variants associated with PR interval duration. Genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix 6.0 microarray. Imputation was performed for 2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using combined YRI and CEU HapMap phase II panels. We observed a strong signal (rs3922844) within the gene encoding the cardiac sodium channel (SCN5A) with genome-wide significant association (p<2.5 x 10⁻⁸) in two of the four cohorts and in the meta-analysis. The signal explained 2% of PR interval variability in African Americans (beta  = 5.1 msec per minor allele, 95% CI  = 4.1-6.1, p = 3 x 10⁻²³). This SNP was also associated with PR interval (beta = 2.4 msec per minor allele, 95% CI = 1.8-3.0, p = 3 x 10⁻¹⁶) in individuals of European ancestry (n = 14,042), but with a smaller effect size (p for heterogeneity <0.001) and variability explained (0.5%). Further meta-analysis of the four cohorts identified genome-wide significant associations with SNPs in SCN10A (rs6798015), MEIS1 (rs10865355), and TBX5 (rs7312625) that were highly correlated with SNPs identified in European and Asian GWA studies. African ancestry was associated with increased PR duration (13.3 msec, p = 0.009) in one but not the other three cohorts. Our findings demonstrate the relevance of common variants to African Americans at four loci previously associated with PR interval in European and Asian samples and identify an association signal at one of these loci that is more strongly associated with PR interval in African Americans than in Europeans.",1
21343950,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a serious complication of pregnancy, which is highly correlated with later life cardiovascular disease (CVD). Many risk factors are common for both diseases, but the contribution of shared genes remains to be determined. In this study, we used an integrative strategy to assess lipid traits as risk factors for PE and CVD by whole genome transcriptional profiling performed on Norwegian decidua basalis tissues (N = 95) from preeclamptic and normal pregnancies and on blood lymphocytes (N = 1240) from the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS). Among 222 genes that were differentially expressed (false discovery rate (FDR) P-value <0.05) between the PE, cases and controls, we found one gene, ACOX2 (acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 2, branched chain), that was downregulated in PE whose transcription was also inversely correlated with triglyceride levels (P = 5.6 × 10(-7); FDR P-value = 0.0002) in SAFHS. We further report associations between SNPs in the ACOX2 gene and the transcription level (P-value = 0.0045) of the gene, as well as with triglyceride levels (P-value = 0.0051). ACOX2 is involved in bile acid production, a process that has been associated with both oxidative stress and regulation of triglyceride levels. Oxidative stress and increased triglyceride levels are known risk factors for CVD and both have also been associated with PE. Our results suggest that downregulation of ACOX2 is a shared risk factor for PE and CVD.",1
21321390,"The identification of early and stage-specific biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical, as the development of disease-modification therapies may depend on the discovery and validation of such markers. The identification of early reliable biomarkers depends on the development of new diagnostic algorithms to computationally exploit the information in large biological datasets. To identify potential biomarkers from mRNA expression profile data, we used the Logic Mining method for the unbiased analysis of a large microarray expression dataset from the anti-NGF AD11 transgenic mouse model. The gene expression profile of AD11 brain regions was investigated at different neurodegeneration stages by whole genome microarrays. A new implementation of the Logic Mining method was applied both to early (1-3 months) and late stage (6-15 months) expression data, coupled to standard statistical methods. A small number of ""fingerprinting"" formulas was isolated, encompassing mRNAs whose expression levels were able to discriminate between diseased and control mice. We selected three differential ""signature"" genes specific for the early stage (Nudt19, Arl16, Aph1b), five common to both groups (Slc15a2, Agpat5, Sox2ot, 2210015, D19Rik, Wdfy1), and seven specific for late stage (D14Ertd449, Tia1, Txnl4, 1810014B01Rik, Snhg3, Actl6a, Rnf25). We suggest these genes as potential biomarkers for the early and late stage of AD-like neurodegeneration in this model and conclude that Logic Mining is a powerful and reliable approach for large scale expression data analysis. Its application to large expression datasets from brain or peripheral human samples may facilitate the discovery of early and stage-specific AD biomarkers.",1
21316860,"Depressive patients often have altered cortisol secretion, but few studies have investigated genetic variants in relation to both cortisol secretion and depression. To identify genes related to both these conditions, we: (1) tested the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis (HPA-axis) candidate genes with a summary measure of total cortisol secretion during the day (cortisol(AUC)), (2) performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) of cortisol(AUC), and (3) tested the association of identified cortisol-related SNPs with depressive symptoms.",1
21303860,"Mutations in the skeletal muscle α-actin gene (ACTA1) cause a range of pathologically defined congenital myopathies. Most patients have dominant mutations and experience severe skeletal muscle weakness, dying within one year of birth. To determine mutant ACTA1 pathobiology, transgenic mice expressing ACTA1(D286G) were created. These Tg(ACTA1)(D286G) mice were less active than wild-type individuals. Their skeletal muscles were significantly weaker by in vitro analyses and showed various pathological lesions reminiscent of human patients, however they had a normal lifespan. Mass spectrometry revealed skeletal muscles from Tg(ACTA1)(D286G) mice contained ∼25% ACTA1(D286G) protein. Tg(ACTA1)(D286G) mice were crossed with hemizygous Acta1(+/-) knock-out mice to generate Tg(ACTA1)(D286G)(+/+).Acta1(+/-) offspring that were homozygous for the transgene and hemizygous for the endogenous skeletal muscle α-actin gene. Akin to most human patients, skeletal muscles from these offspring contained approximately equal proportions of ACTA1(D286G) and wild-type actin. Strikingly, the majority of these mice presented with severe immobility between postnatal Days 8 and 17, requiring euthanasia. Their skeletal muscles contained extensive structural abnormalities as identified in severely affected human patients, including nemaline bodies, actin accumulations and widespread sarcomeric disarray. Therefore we have created valuable mouse models, one of mild dominant ACTA1 disease [Tg(ACTA1)(D286G)], and the other of severe disease, with a dramatically shortened lifespan [Tg(ACTA1)(D286G)(+/+).Acta1(+/-)]. The correlation between mutant ACTA1 protein load and disease severity parallels effects in ACTA1 families and suggests altering this ratio in patient muscle may be a therapy for patients with dominant ACTA1 disease. Furthermore, ringbinden fibres were observed in these mouse models. The presence of such features suggests that perhaps patients with ringbinden of unknown genetic origin should be considered for ACTA1 mutation screening. This is the first experimental, as opposed to observational, evidence that mutant protein load determines the severity of ACTA1 disease.",1

21298047,"Substance dependence or addiction is a complex environmental and genetic disorder that results in serious health and socio-economic consequences. Multiple substance dependence categories together, rather than any one individual addiction outcome, may explain the genetic variability of such disorder. In our study, we defined a composite substance dependence phenotype derived from six individual diagnoses: addiction to nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, opiates or other drugs as a whole. Using data from several genomewide case-control studies, we identified a strong (Odds ratio  = 1.77) and significant (p-value = 7E-8) association signal with a novel gene, PBX/knotted 1 homeobox 2 (PKNOX2), on chromosome 11 with the composite phenotype in European-origin women. The association signal is not as significant when individual outcomes for addiction are considered, or in males or African-origin population. Our findings underscore the importance of considering multiple addiction types and the importance of considering population and gender stratification when analyzing data with heterogeneous population.",1

21285156,"Advances in the study of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene functions have relied on the development of animal models for seeking to explore further what we have learned from the human disease. Specifically, mouse models of a 'triple-negative' breast cancer (utilizing conditional knockout of BRCA1 and p53 in the breast), of an endometrioid ovarian cancer (based on oncogenic kras and loss of function of pten), and of anatomic and functional consequences of BRCA1 mutations in granulosa cells, have led to further inquiry into the pathogenesis and therapeutic consequences of genetic alterations. A striking susceptibility of these murine malignancies to platinum drugs has emerged, providing further confidence in their relevance to the human disease. In addition to these models, the pathogenesis of high-grade serous disease derived from risk-reducing surgeries in mutation carriers has pointed to a role of mutations in p53 commonly encountered in tubal intraepithelial carcinomas.",1
21273288,"High blood concentration of the N-terminal cleavage product of the B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is strongly associated with cardiac dysfunction and is increasingly used for heart failure diagnosis. To identify genetic variants associated with NT-proBNP level, we performed a genome-wide association analysis in 1325 individuals from South Tyrol, Italy, and followed up the most significant results in 1746 individuals from two German population-based studies. A genome-wide significant signal in the MTHFR-CLCN6-NPPA-NPPB gene cluster was replicated, after correction for multiple testing (replication one-sided P-value = 8.4 × 10(-10)). A conditional regression analysis of 128 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the region of interest identified novel variants in the CLCN6 gene as independently associated with NT-proBNP. In this locus, four haplotypes were associated with increased NT-proBNP levels (haplotype-specific combined P-values from 8.3 × 10(-03) to 9.3 × 10(-11)). The observed increase in the NT-proBNP level was proportional to the number of haplotype copies present (i.e. dosage effect), with an increase associated with two copies that varied between 20 and 100 pg/ml across populations. The identification of novel variants in the MTHFR-CLCN6-NPPA-NPPB cluster provides new insights into the biological mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction.",1
21269834,"A major focus of modern biochemical, biophysical and cell biological research is the attribution of function to elements of structure: gene products, genes and higher-order cellular structures. Misunderstandings and controversies can arise in connection with such assignments, in part because of the logical complexity inherent in the relating of structure to function and the failure to distinguish clearly among the different senses in which function can be imputed to elements of structure. I explore distinct ways in which functions are connected to structures and factors that contribute to the context-dependence of such associations so that the multiple senses of function can be made explicit.",0

21253498,"Obesity is an increasingly prevalent and severe health concern with a substantial heritable component and marked sex differences. We sought to determine if the effect of genetic variants also differed by sex by performing a genome-wide association study modeling the effect of genotype-by-sex interaction on obesity phenotypes. Genotype data from individuals in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort were analyzed across five exams. Although no variants showed genome-wide significant gene-by-sex interaction in any individual exam, four polymorphisms displayed a consistent BMI association (P-values .00186 to .00010) across all five exams. These variants were clustered downstream of LYPLAL1, which encodes a lipase/esterase expressed in adipose tissue, a locus previously identified as having sex-specific effects on central obesity. Primary effects in males were in the opposite direction from females and were replicated in Framingham Generation 3. Our data support a sex-influenced association between genetic variation at the LYPLAL1 locus and obesity-related traits.",1
21252315,"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) are a rare but clinically important form of pancreatic neoplasia. To explore the genetic basis of PanNETs, we determined the exomic sequences of 10 nonfamilial PanNETs and then screened the most commonly mutated genes in 58 additional PanNETs. The most frequently mutated genes specify proteins implicated in chromatin remodeling: 44% of the tumors had somatic inactivating mutations in MEN1, which encodes menin, a component of a histone methyltransferase complex, and 43% had mutations in genes encoding either of the two subunits of a transcription/chromatin remodeling complex consisting of DAXX (death-domain-associated protein) and ATRX (α thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked). Clinically, mutations in the MEN1 and DAXX/ATRX genes were associated with better prognosis. We also found mutations in genes in the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway in 14% of the tumors, a finding that could potentially be used to stratify patients for treatment with mTOR inhibitors.",1

However, WT1 does not always conform to the TSG label, and some data indicate that WT1 enhances cell survival and proliferation, like an oncogene. Is WT1 a chameleon, functioning as either a TSG or an oncogene, depending on cellular context? Are these labels even appropriate for describing and understanding the function of WT1?",1
21212030,"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that can be divided in subtypes based on histology, gene expression profiles as well as differences in genomic aberrations. Distinct global DNA methylation profiles have been reported in normal breast epithelial cells as well as in breast tumors. However, the influence of the tumor methylome on the previously described subgroups of breast cancer is not fully understood. Here we report the DNA methylation profiles of 80 breast tumors using a panel of 807 cancer related genes interrogating 1505 CpG sites. We identified three major clusters based on the methylation profiles; one consisting of mainly tumors of myoepithelial origin and two other clusters with tumors of predominantly luminal epithelial origin. The clusters were different with respect to estrogen receptor status, TP53 status, ErbB2 status and grade. The most significantly differentially methylated genes including HDAC1, TFF1, OGG1, BMP3, FZD9 and HOXA11 were confirmed by pyrosequencing. Gene Ontology analysis revealed enrichment for genes involved in developmental processes including homeobox domain genes (HOXA9, HOXA11, PAX6, MYBL2, ISL1 and IPF1) and (ETS1, HDAC1, CREBBP, GAS7, SPI1 and TBX1). Extensive correlation to mRNA expression was observed. Pathway analyses identified a significant association with canonical (curated) pathways such as hepatic fibrosis including genes like EGF, NGFR and TNF, dendritic cell maturation and the NF-κB signaling pathway. Our results show that breast tumor expression subtypes harbor major epigenetic differences and tumors with similar gene expression profiles might belong to epigenetically different subtypes. Some of the transcription factors identified, with key roles in differentiation and development might play a role in inducing and maintaining the different phenotypes.",1
21208937,"The genetic determinants of variation in iron status are actively sought, but remain incompletely understood. Meta-analysis of two genome-wide association (GWA) studies and replication in three independent cohorts was performed to identify genetic loci associated in the general population with serum levels of iron and markers of iron status, including transferrin, ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and sTfR-ferritin index. We identified and replicated a novel association of a common variant in the type-2 transferrin receptor (TFR2) gene with iron levels, with effect sizes highly consistent across samples. In addition, we identified and replicated an association between the HFE locus and ferritin and confirmed previously reported associations with the TF, TMPRSS6 and HFE genes. The five replicated variants were tested for association with expression levels of the corresponding genes in a publicly available data set of human liver samples, and nominally statistically significant expression differences by genotype were observed for all genes, although only rs3811647 in the TF gene survived the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. In addition, we measured for the first time the effects of the common variant in TMPRSS6, rs4820268, on hepcidin mRNA in peripheral blood (n = 83 individuals) and on hepcidin levels in urine (n = 529) and observed an association in the same direction, though only borderline significant. These functional findings require confirmation in further studies with larger sample sizes, but they suggest that common variants in TMPRSS6 could modify the hepcidin-iron feedback loop in clinically unaffected individuals, thus making them more susceptible to imbalances of iron homeostasis.",1
21184583,"Event-related brain oscillations (EROs) represent highly heritable neuroelectrical correlates of human perception and cognitive performance that exhibit marked deficits in patients with various psychiatric disorders. We report the results of the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of an ERO endophenotype-frontal theta ERO evoked by visual oddball targets during P300 response in 1,064 unrelated individuals drawn from a study of alcohol dependence. Forty-two SNPs of the Illumina HumanHap 1 M microarray were selected from the theta ERO GWAS for replication in family-based samples (N = 1,095), with four markers revealing nominally significant association. The most significant marker from the two-stage study is rs4907240 located within ARID protein 5A gene (ARID5A) on chromosome 2q11 (unadjusted, Fisher's combined P = 3.68 × 10⁻⁶). However, the most intriguing association to emerge is with rs7916403 in serotonin receptor gene HTR7 on chromosome 10q23 (combined P = 1.53 × 10⁻⁴), implicating the serotonergic system in the neurophysiological underpinnings of theta EROs. Moreover, promising SNPs were tested for association with diagnoses of alcohol dependence (DSM-IV), revealing a significant relationship with the HTR7 polymorphism among GWAS case-controls (P = 0.008). Significant recessive genetic effects were also detected for alcohol dependence in both case-control and family-based samples (P = 0.031 and 0.042, respectively), with the HTR7 risk allele corresponding to theta ERO reductions among homozygotes. These results suggest a role of the serotonergic system in the biological basis of alcohol dependence and underscore the utility of analyzing brain oscillations as a powerful approach to understanding complex genetic psychiatric disorders.",1
21184388,"Over the years, drug products, including those indicated for diabetes, have been withdrawn from the marketplace because of quality concerns and/or severe adverse drug reactions. While the drug regulatory process is designed to detect, among other things, adverse drug reactions before a drug receives marketing authorization, for various reasons, premarket detection of all potential adverse reactions associated with a drug may not be possible. As such, regulatory authorities must also react to and manage adverse reactions identified at the postmarket stage. In this article, we provide a general overview of drug regulation in Canada and the United States and consider an example of a drug indicated for the treatment of diabetes and how newly identified potential safety concerns were managed in the postmarket environment.",0
21183795,"Autoimmune diseases develop in approximately 5% of humans. They can arise when self-tolerance checkpoints of the immune system are bypassed as a consequence of inherited mutations of key genes involved in lymphocyte activation, survival, or death. For example, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) results from defects in self-tolerance checkpoints as a consequence of mutations in the death receptor-encoding gene TNF receptor superfamily, member 6 (TNFRSF6; also known as FAS). However, some mutation carriers remain asymptomatic throughout life. We have now demonstrated in 7 ALPS patients that the disease develops as a consequence of an inherited TNFRSF6 heterozygous mutation combined with a somatic genetic event in the second TNFRSF6 allele. Analysis of the patients' CD4(-)CD8(-) (double negative) T cells--accumulation of which is a hallmark of ALPS--revealed that in these cells, 3 patients had somatic mutations in their second TNFRSF6 allele, while 4 patients had loss of heterozygosity by telomeric uniparental disomy of chromosome 10. This observation provides the molecular bases of a nonmalignant autoimmune disease development in humans and may shed light on the mechanism underlying the occurrence of other autoimmune diseases.",1

Evidence of variations in adiponectin (AdipoQ) genes that are associated with ischemic stroke has not been consistent, and it is unclear whether the same loci contribute to these associations in the Korean population. Using a Korean population, we tested ischemic stroke-associated AdipoQ markers.",0
21149283,"The level of body iron storage and the erythropoietic need for iron are indicated by the serum levels of ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), respectively. A meta-analysis of five genome-wide association studies on sTfR and ferritin revealed novel association to the PCSK7 and TMPRSS6 loci for sTfR and the HFE locus for both parameters. The PCSK7 association was the most significant (rs236918, P = 1.1 × 10E-27) suggesting that proprotein convertase 7, the gene product of PCSK7, may be involved in sTfR generation and/or iron homeostasis. Conditioning the sTfR analyses on transferrin saturation abolished the HFE signal and substantially diminished the TMPRSS6 signal while the PCSK7 association was unaffected, suggesting that the former may be mediated by transferrin saturation whereas the PCSK7-associated effect on sTfR generation appears to be more direct.",1
21143351,"The exon-intron structure of eukaryotic genes raises a question about the distribution of transmembrane regions in membrane proteins. Were exons that encode transmembrane regions formed simply by inserting introns into preexisting genes or by some kind of exon shuffling? To answer this question, the exon-per-gene distribution was analyzed for all genes in 40 eukaryotic genomes with a particular focus on exons encoding transmembrane segments. In 21 higher multicellular eukaryotes, the percentage of multi-exon genes (those containing at least one intron) within all genes in a genome was high (>70%) and with a mean of 87%. When genes were grouped by the number of exons per gene in higher eukaryotes, good exponential distributions were obtained not only for all genes but also for the exons encoding transmembrane segments, leading to a constant ratio of membrane proteins independent of the exon-per-gene number. The positional distribution of transmembrane regions in single-pass membrane proteins showed that they are generally located in the amino or carboxyl terminal regions. This nonrandom distribution of transmembrane regions explains the constant ratio of membrane proteins to the exon-per-gene numbers because there are always two terminal (i.e., the amino and carboxyl) regions - independent of the length of sequences.",0
21106707,"Mutagen sensitivity, a measurement of chromatid breaks induced by various mutagens in short-term cultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes, is an established risk factor for a number of cancers and is highly heritable. The purpose of this study is to identify genetic predictors of mutagen sensitivity. Therefore, we conducted a multi-stage genome-wide association study. The primary scan analyzed 539,437 autosomal SNPs in 673 healthy individuals, followed by validations in two independent sets of 575 and 259 healthy individuals, respectively. One SNP, rs8093763, on chromosome 18q21 showed significant association with bleomycin (BLM) sensitivity (combined P = 2.64 × 10⁻⁸). We observed significantly lower BLM-induced chromotid breaks for genotypes containing wild-type allele compared with the homozygous variant genotype in the discovery set (0.71 versus 0.90, P= 3.77 × 10⁻⁵) and in replication phase 1 (0.61 versus 0.84, P= 7.00 × 10⁻⁵). The result of replication phase 2 was not statistically significant (0.65 versus 0.68, P= 0.44). This SNP is approximately 64 kb from PMAIP1/Noxa, which is a radiation-inducible gene and exhibits higher expression in BLM-sensitive lymphoblastoid cell lines than insensitive cell lines upon BLM treatment. In conclusion, we identified a biologically plausible genetic variant on 18q21 near the PMAIP1/Noxa gene that is associated with BLM sensitivity.",1
21105360,"Earlier, it was established that polymorphism of minisatellite UPS29 located in one of introns of human gene CENTB5 (ACAP3) was associated with Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. The main aim of this work was to elucidate if that minisatellite could regulate reporter gene activity, and if such activity was tissue (cell)-specific. To this end there was used transient transfection of HeLa cells, mouse embryonal carcinoma line F9, and rat astrocytes cultures with plasmides which contained reporter gene EGFP under eukaryotic promoter ROSA26 and different allelles of minisatellite UPS29. It was found that UPS29 possessed enhancer-like activity in neuronal type cells.",1
21104366,"Osteoporosis is a highly heritable common bone disease leading to fractures that severely impair the life quality of patients. Wrist fractures caused by osteoporosis are largely due to the scarcity of wrist bone mass. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of wrist bone mineral density (BMD). We examined ∼500000 SNP markers in 1000 unrelated homogeneous Caucasian subjects and found a novel allelic association with wrist BMD at rs11023787 in the SOX6 (SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 6) gene (P=9.00×10(-5)). Subjects carrying the C allele of rs11023787 in SOX6 had significantly higher mean wrist BMD values than those with the T allele (0.485:0.462 g cm(-2) for C allele vs. T allele carriers). For validation, we performed SOX6 association for BMD in an independent Chinese sample and found that SNP rs11023787 was significantly associated with wrist BMD in the Chinese sample (P=6.41×10(-3)). Meta-analyses of the GWAS scan and the replication studies yielded P-values of 5.20×10(-6) for rs11023787. Results of this study, together with the functional relevance of SOX6 in cartilage formation, support the SOX6 gene as an important gene for BMD variation.",1
21102214,"Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is a rare congenital disorder associated with multiple musculoskeletal contractures that causes substantial morbidity. Knee involvement is commonly seen among children with arthrogryposis, with flexion contracture of the knee being the most frequent knee deformity. Knee flexion contractures in the pediatric population are particularly debilitating as they affect ambulation. Treatment for knee flexion contractures requires numerous orthopaedic procedures and an extensive follow-up period. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of orthopaedic procedures, namely distal femoral supracondylar extension osteotomy and/or Ilizarov external fixator, on the ambulation status of children with knee flexion contracture and whether any functional gains are maintained at the latest follow-up.",0
21072201,"Aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) is a rare condition that is characterized by the development of bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients after ingestion of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including aspirin. However, the underlying mechanisms of AIA occurrence are still not fully understood. To identify the genetic variations associated with aspirin intolerance in asthmatics, the first stage of genome-wide association study with 109,365 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was undertaken in a Korean AIA (n = 80) cohort and aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA, n = 100) subjects as controls. For the second stage of follow-up study, 150 common SNPs from 11 candidate genes were genotyped in 163 AIA patients including intermediate AIA (AIA-I) subjects and 429 ATA controls. Among 11 candidate genes, multivariate logistic analyses showed that SNPs of CEP68 gene showed the most significant association with aspirin intolerance (P values of co-dominant for CEP68, 6.0×10(-5) to 4.0×10(-5)). All seven SNPs of the CEP68 gene showed linkage disequilibrium (LD), and the haplotype of CEP68_ht4 (T-G-A-A-A-C-G) showed a highly significant association with aspirin intolerance (OR= 2.63; 95% CI= 1.64-4.21; P = 6.0×10(-5)). Moreover, the nonsynonymous CEP68 rs7572857G>A variant that replaces glycine with serine showed a higher decline of forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV(1)) by aspirin provocation than other variants (P = 3.0×10(-5)). Our findings imply that CEP68 could be a susceptible gene for aspirin intolerance in asthmatics, suggesting that the nonsynonymous Gly74Ser could affect the polarity of the protein structure.",1

21057513,"An average human ejaculate contains over 100 million sperm, but only a few succeed in accomplishing the journey to an egg by migration through the female reproductive tract. Among these few sperm, only one participates in fertilization. There might be an ingenious molecular mechanism to ensure that the very best sperm fertilize an egg. However, recent gene disruption experiments in mice have revealed that many factors previously described as important for fertilization are largely dispensable. One could argue that the fertilization mechanism is made robust against gene disruptions. However, this is not likely, as there are already six different gene-disrupted mouse lines (Calmegin, Adam1a, Adam2, Adam3, Ace and Pgap1), all of which result in male sterility. The sperm from these animals are known to have defective zona-binding ability and at the same time lose oviduct-migrating ability. Concerning sperm-zona binding, the widely accepted involvement of sugar moiety on zona pellucida 3 (ZP3) is indicated to be dispensable by gene disruption experiments. Thus, the landscape of the mechanism of fertilization is revolving considerably. In the sperm-egg fusion process, CD9 on egg and IZUMO1 on sperm have emerged as essential factors. This review focuses on the mechanism of fertilization elucidated by gene-manipulated animals.",1
21051317,"The high heterogeneity of clinical, histological, biological and genetic features in breast cancer is due in part to the extreme molecular complexity of these tumors. This review article presents the major technological advances of the past ten years, in particular the development of microarray approaches, which have enabled genome-wide (""Omics"") analysis of these tumors. Numerous genetic and epigenetic alterations involving a small number of altered signalling pathways (PI3K, NK-κB, FGF, etc.) have been described. The next decade will be even more prolific in terms of discovery with the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies that will provide fast and low cost constitutional and somatic genome sequences. The full catalogue of somatic genetic alterations will result in a completely new individual management for breast cancer patients.",1
21051183,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare but lethal malignancy arising from the biliary tract epithelium. It has a poor prognosis largely due to the difficulties of early diagnosis and the lack of effective therapies. It is thus imperative to develop new and effective treatments for CCA, which depends heavily on the mechanistic understanding of the disease. Previous studies have suggested that somatic mutations in KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA genes are frequently found in several types of human cancers including colon, breast, and lung carcinomas as well as CCA. Yet, the frequency and the involvement of these oncogenic mutations in CCA in Chinese population have not been investigated. In this study, we evaluated the hotspot mutations of KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA genes in 34 Chinese CCA patients. Sequencing analysis revealed 13 (38.2%) and 11 (32.4%) patients bearing KRAS and PIK3CA mutations, in which two (5.9%) of them harbored both KRAS and PIK3CA mutations. Surprisingly, no BRAF mutation was detected in all 34 CCA samples. Our findings indicate that somatic mutations in KRAS and PIK3CA but not BRAF oncogenes are closely associated with the development of CCA in Chinese population and provide new potential targets for future therapeutic treatments of the disease.",1
21048783,"Moyamoya disease (MMD) shows progressive cerebral angiopathy characterized by bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis and abnormal collateral vessels. Although ∼ 15% of MMD cases are familial, the MMD gene(s) remain unknown. A genome-wide association study of 785,720 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed, comparing 72 Japanese MMD patients with 45 Japanese controls and resulting in a strong association of chromosome 17q25-ter with MMD risk. This result was further confirmed by a locus-specific association study using 335 SNPs in the 17q25-ter region. A single haplotype consisting of seven SNPs at the RNF213 locus was tightly associated with MMD (P = 5.3 × 10(-10)). RNF213 encodes a really interesting new gene finger protein with an AAA ATPase domain and is abundantly expressed in spleen and leukocytes. An RNA in situ hybridization analysis of mouse tissues indicated that mature lymphocytes express higher levels of Rnf213 mRNA than their immature counterparts. Mutational analysis of RNF213 revealed a founder mutation, p.R4859K, in 95% of MMD families, 73% of non-familial MMD cases and 1.4% of controls; this mutation greatly increases the risk of MMD (P = 1.2 × 10(-43), odds ratio = 190.8, 95% confidence interval = 71.7-507.9). Three additional missense mutations were identified in the p.R4859K-negative patients. These results indicate that RNF213 is the first identified susceptibility gene for MMD.",1

20953551,"Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is a multiplex copy number analysis method that is routinely used to identify large mutations in many clinical and research labs. One of the most important drawbacks of the standard MLPA setup is a complicated, and therefore expensive, procedure of generating long MLPA probes. This drawback substantially limits the applicability of MLPA to those genomic regions for which ready-to-use commercial kits are available. Here we present a simple protocol for designing MLPA probe sets that are composed entirely of short oligonucleotide half-probes generated through chemical synthesis. As an example, we present the design and generation of an MLPA assay for parallel copy number and small-mutation analysis of the EGFR gene.",0
20951313,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for approximately 85% of cases. A significant proportion of NSCLC cases are not diagnosed until a late stage, when aggressive treatments are required but often prolong survival only modestly. Recent advances in molecular characterization of NSCLC have enabled identification of numerous cell growth and proliferation pathways that are disrupted in these tumors. This knowledge has provided insight into the mechanisms of tumor development in various histologic subtypes of NSCLC and has pointed the way toward targeted treatment strategies. In this review, we highlight literature findings of somatic mutations in genes involved in cell growth and proliferation that are commonly found in the various subtypes of NSCLC, and we discuss how these findings may relate to treatment strategies.",1
20939080,"Tardive dyskinesia (TD) occurs in approximately 20% of patients exposed to long-term antipsychotic treatment and may be influenced by genetic predisposition, in addition to clinical risk factors. In this study, we implemented a two-step approach to identify susceptibility genes for TD. First, we performed a secondary analysis of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset to identify candidate genes for TD severity. A total of 327 schizophrenia patients treated with antipsychotics who participated in the CATIE trial were included in a TD severity GWAS (approximately 495,000 SNPs). Cases were defined as demonstrating involuntary movements of a mild degree in two or more body regions or of a moderate to severe degree in at least one body region on at least two separate evaluations, whereas controls were completely free of abnormal involuntary movement on all evaluations. Using logistic regression and controlling for population stratification and relevant clinical risk factors, none of the associated SNPs reached GWAS significance; however, several promising SNPs were identified for follow-up investigation. In the second step, we performed an association study of the top 25 SNPs in an independent sample of 170 Jewish, Israeli, schizophrenia patients (retrospective, cross-sectional design). Association of the SNP rs3943552 T allele in the GLI2 gene with TD was observed in a subsample of Ashkenazi Jewish patients (N = 96, P = 0.018; P = 6.2 × 10⁻⁵ in the CATIE sample). The GLI2 gene encodes a transcription factor that participates in the development of the dopaminergic system during embryogenesis. Taken together, our findings support a possible contribution of GLI2 to TD susceptibility.",1
20935157,"The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling pathway is an important growth-regulatory pathway, which plays a crucial role in colorectal cancer (CRC) proliferation, differentiation, migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis.

20846645,"Research on the relationship between the representation of space and time has produced two contrasting proposals. ATOM posits that space and time are represented via a common magnitude system, suggesting a symmetrical relationship between space and time. According to metaphor theory, however, representations of time depend on representations of space asymmetrically. Previous findings in humans have supported metaphor theory. Here, we investigate the relationship between time and space in a nonverbal species, by testing whether non-human primates show space-time interactions consistent with metaphor theory or with ATOM. We tested two rhesus monkeys and 16 adult humans in a nonverbal task that assessed the influence of an irrelevant dimension (time or space) on a relevant dimension (space or time). In humans, spatial extent had a large effect on time judgments whereas time had a small effect on spatial judgments. In monkeys, both spatial and temporal manipulations showed large bi-directional effects on judgments. In contrast to humans, spatial manipulations in monkeys did not produce a larger effect on temporal judgments than the reverse. Thus, consistent with previous findings, human adults showed asymmetrical space-time interactions that were predicted by metaphor theory. In contrast, monkeys showed patterns that were more consistent with ATOM.",0
20844536,"Specialized cellular microenvironments, or 'niches', modulate stem cell properties, including cell number, self-renewal and fate decisions. In the adult brain, niches that maintain a source of neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The size of the NSC population of the SVZ at any time is the result of several ongoing processes, including self-renewal, cell differentiation, and cell death. Maintaining the balance between NSCs and NPCs in the SVZ niche is critical to supply the brain with specific neural populations, both under normal conditions or after injury. A fundamental question relevant to both normal development and to cell-based repair strategies in the central nervous system is how the balance of different NSC and NPC populations is maintained in the niche. EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and Notch signalling pathways have fundamental roles during development of multicellular organisms. In Drosophila and in Caenorhabditis elegans these pathways may have either cooperative or antagonistic functions. In the SVZ, Notch regulates NSC identity and self-renewal, whereas EGFR specifically affects NPC proliferation and migration. This suggests that interplay of these two pathways may maintain the balance between NSC and NPC numbers. Here we show that functional cell-cell interaction between NPCs and NSCs through EGFR and Notch signalling has a crucial role in maintaining the balance between these cell populations in the SVZ. Enhanced EGFR signalling in vivo results in the expansion of the NPC pool, and reduces NSC number and self-renewal. This occurs through a non-cell-autonomous mechanism involving EGFR-mediated regulation of Notch signalling. Our findings define a novel interaction between EGFR and Notch pathways in the adult SVZ, and thus provide a mechanism for NSC and NPC pool maintenance.",1
20842527,"A simple and efficient flow-based technique is reported for the catalytic deuteration of several model nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds which are important building blocks of pharmacologically active materials. A continuous flow reactor was used in combination with on-demand pressure-controlled electrolytic D(2) production. The D(2) source was D(2)O, the consumption of which was very low. The experimental set-up allows the fine-tuning of pressure, temperature, and flow rate so as to determine the optimal conditions for the deuteration reactions. The described procedure lacks most of the drawbacks of the conventional batch deuteration techniques, and additionally is highly selective and reproducible.",0
20824714,"Frameshift mutations at coding mononucleotide repeats (cMNR) are frequent in high-microsatellite instability (MSI-H) cancers. Frameshift mutations in cMNR result in the formation of a premature termination codon (PTC) in the transcribed mRNA, and these abnormal mRNAs are generally degraded by nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD). We have identified novel genes that are frequently mutated at their cMNR by blocking NMD in two MSI-H cancer cell lines. After blocking NMD, we screened for differentially expressed genes using DNA microarrays, and then used database analysis to select 28 candidate genes containing cMNR with more than 9 nucleotide repeats. cMNR mutations have not been previously reported in MSI-H cancers for 15 of the 28 genes. We analyzed the cMNR mutation of each of the 15 genes in 10 MSI-H cell lines and 21 MSI-H cancers, and found frequent mutations of 12 genes in MSI-H cell lines and cancers, but not in microsatellite stable (MSS) cancers. Among these genes, the most frequently mutated in MSI-H cell lines were MLL3 (70%), PHACTR4 (70%), RUFY2 (50%) and TBC1D23 (50%). MLL3, which has already been implicated in cancer, had the highest mutation frequency in MSI-H cancers (48%). Our combined approach of NMD block, database search, and mutation analysis has identified a large number of genes mutated in their cMNR in MSI-H cancers. The identified mutations are expected to contribute to MSI-H tumorigenesis by causing an absence of gene expression or low gene dosage effects.",1

20807224,"Conotruncal defects (CTDs) represent 15-20% of all congenital heart defects. Mutations in a number of genes have been associated with CTD in humans and animal models. We investigated the occurrence and the prevalence of GATA4, NKX2.5, ZFPM2/FOG2, GDF1, and ISLET1 gene mutations in a large cohort of individuals with CTD, including tetralogy of Fallot with or without pulmonary atresia (TOF, 178 patients), double outlet right ventricle (DORV, 13 patients), and truncus arteriosus (11 patients). Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis followed by bidirectional sequencing disclosed no putative pathogenic mutation in GATA4, ISLET1, and GDF1 genes. Two novel (Ile227Val, Met544Ile) and one previously reported (Glu30Gly) possibly pathogenic missense variants were identified in the ZFPM2/FOG2 gene in 3 sporadic patients of 202 (1.5%) with CTD, including 1 of 178 (0.6%) with TOF and 2 of 13 (15.4%) with DORV. Mutation analysis also detected one known missense change (Arg25Cys) in NKX2.5 gene in two (1.1%) sporadic patients with TOF. These sequence alterations were found to be absent in 500 population-matched controls. In conclusion, the present results (i) indicate and confirm that mutations in the GATA4, GDF1, and ISLET1 genes are not major determinants in the pathogenesis of TOF, (ii) provide supportive evidence of an association between ZFPM2/FOG2 gene and TOF/DORV, and (iii) provide additional examples of the possible contribution of the Arg25Cys change in the NKX2.5 to a small number of TOF cases.",1

20728450,"Patients with diabetes mellitus can develop cardiac dysfunction in the absence of underlying coronary artery disease or hypertension; a condition defined as diabetic cardiomyopathy. Mice lacking the intracellular protein kinase Akt2 develop a syndrome that is similar to diabetes mellitus type 2. Expression profiling of akt2(-/-) myocardium revealed that Rab4a, a GTPase involved in glucose transporter 4 translocation and β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) recycling to the plasma membrane, was significantly induced. We therefore hypothesized that Akt2 deficiency increases myocardial β-adrenergic sensitivity. Confirmatory analysis revealed up-regulation of Rab4a mRNA and protein in akt2(-/-) myocardium. In cultured cardiomyocyte experiments, Rab4a was induced by pharmacological inhibition of Akt as well as by specific knockdown of Akt2 with siRNA. Isolated akt2(-/-) hearts were hypersensitive to isoproterenol (ISO) but exhibited normal sensitivity to forskolin. Prolonged ISO treatment led to increased cardiac hypertrophy in akt2(-/-) mice compared to wild type mice. In addition, spontaneous hypertrophy was noted in aged akt2(-/-) hearts that was inhibited by treatment with the βAR blocker propranolol. In agreement with previous results demonstrating increased fatty acid oxidation rates in akt2(-/-) myocardium, we found increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) activity in the hearts of these animals. Interestingly, increased myocardial Rab4a expression was present in mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of PPARα and was also observed upon stimulation of PPARα activity in cultured cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, propranolol attenuated the development of cardiac hypertrophy in the PPARα transgenic mice as well. Our results indicate that reduced Akt2 leads to up-regulation of Rab4a expression in cardiomyocytes in a cell-autonomous fashion that may involve activation of PPARα. This maladaptive response is associated with hypersensitivity of akt2(-/-) myocardium to β-adrenergic stimulation.",1

20705733,"Serum calcium levels are tightly regulated. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in population-based studies participating in the CHARGE Consortium to uncover common genetic variations associated with total serum calcium levels. GWAS of serum calcium concentrations was performed in 20 611 individuals of European ancestry for ∼2.5 million genotyped and imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The SNP with the lowest P-value was rs17251221 (P = 2.4 * 10(-22), minor allele frequency 14%) in the calcium-sensing receptor gene (CASR). This lead SNP was associated with higher serum calcium levels [0.06 mg/dl (0.015 mmol/l) per copy of the minor G allele] and accounted for 0.54% of the variance in serum calcium concentrations. The identification of variation in CASR that influences serum calcium concentration confirms the results of earlier candidate gene studies. The G allele of rs17251221 was also associated with higher serum magnesium levels (P = 1.2 * 10(-3)), lower serum phosphate levels (P = 2.8 * 10(-7)) and lower bone mineral density at the lumbar spine (P = 0.038), but not the femoral neck. No additional genomic loci contained SNPs associated at genome-wide significance (P < 5 * 10(-8)). These associations resemble clinical characteristics of patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, an autosomal-dominant disease arising from rare inactivating mutations in the CASR gene. We conclude that common genetic variation in the CASR gene is associated with similar but milder features in the general population.",1

Here we report results from a genome-wide association study of serum calcium, integrating data from four independent cohorts including a total of 12,865 individuals of European and Indian Asian descent. Our meta-analysis shows that serum calcium is associated with SNPs in or near the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) gene on 3q13. The top hit with a p-value of 6.3 x 10(-37) is rs1801725, a missense variant, explaining 1.26% of the variance in serum calcium. This SNP had the strongest association in individuals of European descent, while for individuals of Indian Asian descent the top hit was rs17251221 (p = 1.1 x 10(-21)), a SNP in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs1801725. The strongest locus in CASR was shown to replicate in an independent Icelandic cohort of 4,126 individuals (p = 1.02 x 10(-4)). This genome-wide meta-analysis shows that common CASR variants modulate serum calcium levels in the adult general population, which confirms previous results in some candidate gene studies of the CASR locus. This study highlights the key role of CASR in calcium regulation.",1
20622881,"We performed a genome-wide association study on 1,292 individuals with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and 30,503 controls from Iceland and The Netherlands, with a follow-up of top markers in up to 3,267 individuals with AAAs and 7,451 controls. The A allele of rs7025486 on 9q33 was found to associate with AAA, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.21 and P = 4.6 x 10(-10). In tests for association with other vascular diseases, we found that rs7025486[A] is associated with early onset myocardial infarction (OR = 1.18, P = 3.1 x 10(-5)), peripheral arterial disease (OR = 1.14, P = 3.9 x 10(-5)) and pulmonary embolism (OR = 1.20, P = 0.00030), but not with intracranial aneurysm or ischemic stroke. No association was observed between rs7025486[A] and common risk factors for arterial and venous diseases-that is, smoking, lipid levels, obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Rs7025486 is located within DAB2IP, which encodes an inhibitor of cell growth and survival.",1
20596629,"WIF-1 is a negative regulator of the Wnt-signaling pathway that may have important implications for tumorigenesis. Microarray analysis of whole genome expression in mesothelioma tissue revealed down-regulation of 491 genes and up-regulation of 167 genes involved mainly in Jak-STAT signaling (8 genes), MAPK signaling (16 genes) and Wnt signaling (13 genes) pathways. Of these, WIF-1 gene was down-regulated in mesothelioma 72-fold compared to normal tissue. We also analyzed WIF-1 and SFRPs promoter methylations in 46 mesothelioma tissues, 8 mesothelioma cell lines by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). WIF-1 promoter methylation was observed in 34 of 46 mesothelioma tissues (73.9%) and in all 8 mesothelioma cell lines. SFRP1, 2 and 4 promoter methylation was observed in 21 of 37 (56.8%), 26 of 42 (61.9%) and 17 of 36 (47.2%) mesothelioma tissues, respectively. Promoter methylation of any WIF-1 and/or SFRP genes was observed in 44 of 46 (95.6%) mesothelioma tissues. The treatment of mesothelioma cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-2dC) showed WIF-1 promoter methylation recovery followed by restoration of WIF-1 expression in 6 of 8 mesothelioma cell lines. The cytoplasmic expression of beta-catenin was observed in 38 of 43 cases of mesothelioma without any nuclear reactivity. The eight mesothelioma cell lines and 27 cases of mesothelioma examined showed no mutation in exon 3 of beta-catenin suggesting no alteration of canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Our data suggest that WIF-1 promoter methylation is a common event in mesothelioma.",1
20579853,"The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of cancer genes contributing to oral squamous cell (OSCC) development and progression and correlate genetic changes to clinical parameters. Human papilloma virus (HPV) 16 detection is also included in the study. 60 samples of OSCC were analysed for c-erbB2 and c-myc amplification by dPCR, H-ras and p53 point mutations by PCR/SSCP. HPV was detected via amplification of its E1 and E6 genes. c-erbB2 was altered in 45%, c-myc in 35%, H-ras in 22% and p53 in 60% of samples. HPV was detected in 10% of cases. The frequency of p53 gene mutations showed a statistically significant association with tumour stage. Patients with c-erbB2 and H-ras alterations had lower survival than patients without these alterations. The number of detected genetic changes was remarkable but statistical association with tumour natural history was poor, indicating high clonal heterogeneity and multiple pathways of carcinogenesis.",1

20548944,"Osteoporosis is a complex disorder and commonly leads to fractures in elderly persons. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become an unbiased approach to identify variations in the genome that potentially affect health. However, the genetic variants identified so far only explain a small proportion of the heritability for complex traits. Due to the modest genetic effect size and inadequate power, true association signals may not be revealed based on a stringent genome-wide significance threshold. Here, we take advantage of SNP and transcript arrays and integrate GWAS and expression signature profiling relevant to the skeletal system in cellular and animal models to prioritize the discovery of novel candidate genes for osteoporosis-related traits, including bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN), as well as geometric indices of the hip (femoral neck-shaft angle, NSA; femoral neck length, NL; and narrow-neck width, NW). A two-stage meta-analysis of GWAS from 7,633 Caucasian women and 3,657 men, revealed three novel loci associated with osteoporosis-related traits, including chromosome 1p13.2 (RAP1A, p = 3.6x10(-8)), 2q11.2 (TBC1D8), and 18q11.2 (OSBPL1A), and confirmed a previously reported region near TNFRSF11B/OPG gene. We also prioritized 16 suggestive genome-wide significant candidate genes based on their potential involvement in skeletal metabolism. Among them, 3 candidate genes were associated with BMD in women. Notably, 2 out of these 3 genes (GPR177, p = 2.6x10(-13); SOX6, p = 6.4x10(-10)) associated with BMD in women have been successfully replicated in a large-scale meta-analysis of BMD, but none of the non-prioritized candidates (associated with BMD) did. Our results support the concept of our prioritization strategy. In the absence of direct biological support for identified genes, we highlighted the efficiency of subsequent functional characterization using publicly available expression profiling relevant to the skeletal system in cellular or whole animal models to prioritize candidate genes for further functional validation.",1

20547083,"Short/branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD) deficiency, also known as 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, is a recently described autosomal recessive disorder of isoleucine metabolism. Most patients reported thus far have originated from a founder mutation in the Hmong Chinese population. While the first reported patients had severe disease, most of the affected Hmong have remained asymptomatic. In this study, we describe 11 asymptomatic non-Hmong patients brought to medical attention by elevated C5-carnitine found by newborn screening and one discovered because of clinical symptoms. The diagnosis of SBCAD deficiency was determined by metabolite analysis of blood, urine, and fibroblast samples. PCR and bidirectional sequencing were performed on genomic DNA from five of the patients covering the entire SBCAD (ACADSB) gene sequence of 11 exons. Sequence analysis of genomic DNA from each patient identified variations in the SBCAD gene not previously reported. Escherichia coli expression studies revealed that the missense mutations identified lead to inactivation or instability of the mutant SBCAD enzymes. These findings confirm that SBCAD deficiency can be identified through newborn screening by acylcarnitine analysis. Our patients have been well without treatment and call for careful follow-up studies to learn the true clinical impact of this disorder.",1
20538800,"Somatic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) were recently demonstrated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but their prevalence and prognostic impact remain to be explored in large extensively characterized AML series, and also in various other hematologic malignancies. Here, we demonstrate in 893 newly diagnosed cases of AML mutations in the IDH1 (6%) and IDH2 (11%) genes. Moreover, we identified IDH mutations in 2 JAK2 V617F myeloproliferative neoplasias (n = 96), a single case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 96), and none in chronic myeloid leukemias (n = 81). In AML, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are more common among AML with normal karyotype and NPM1(mutant) genotypes. IDH1 mutation status is an unfavorable prognostic factor as regards survival in a composite genotypic subset lacking FLT3(ITD) and NPM1(mutant). Thus, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are common genetic aberrations in AML, and IDH1 mutations may carry prognostic value in distinct subtypes of AML.",1

Despite the lack of experimental quantitative knowledge, one can see a dynamical biological system as (i) the combined evolution tendencies (increase or decrease) of the biological compound concentrations, and: (ii) the temporal features, such as delays between two concentration peaks (i.e. the times when one of the components completes an increase (resp. decrease) phase and starts a decrease (resp. increase) phase).",0
20500513,"We observed an unusually large subependymoma in a female patient with congenital aniridia. To analyze the genetic mechanisms of tumorigenesis, we first examined the paired box 6 (PAX6) gene using both tumor tissue and peripheral lymphocytes. Tumor suppressor activity has been proposed for PAX6 in gliomas, in addition to its well-known role in the eye development. Using genomic quantitative PCR and loss of heterozygosity analysis, we identified hemizygous deletions in the 5'-region of PAX6. In lymphocytes, the deletion within PAX6 spanned from between exons 6 and 7 to the 5'-upstream region of the gene, but did not reach the upstream gene, RNC1, which is reported to be associated with tumors. The subependymoma had an additional de novo deletion spanning from the intron 4 to intron 6 of PAX6, although we could not completely determine whether these two deletions are on the same chromosome or not. We also examined other potentially relevant tumor suppressor genes: PTEN, TP53 and SOX2. However, we detected no exonic mutations or deletions in these genes. Collectively, we speculate that the defect in PAX6 may have contributed to the extremely large size of the subependymoma, due to a loss of tumor suppressor activity in glial cell lineage.",1

20471519,"Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) is a rare, low-grade malignant soft tissue tumor that is often mistaken for either benign or more malignant tumor types. Commonly, this tumor affects young adults and typically arises in the deep proximal extremities or trunk with frequent recurrences and can metastasize to the lungs many years later. Most cases have a recurrent balanced translocation involving chromosomes 7 and 16, t(7;16)(q32-34;p11), which leads to the fusion of the FUS and CREB3L2 genes. However, supernumerary ring chromosomes have been identified in a subset of FUS/CREB3L2-positive LGFMS, but it has not yet been formally demonstrated that such ring chromosomes harbor the FUS/CREB3L2 fusion gene. Here, we report the genetic findings of a supernumerary ring chromosome from an LGFMS from a 77-year-old man. Chromosome banding analysis revealed a supernumerary ring chromosome, and further studies with fluorescence in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that the ring contained material from chromosomes 7 and 16, that the FUS gene was present in two rearranged copies, and that it expressed the FUS/CREB3L2 fusion gene. Moreover, an assessment of previously reported cases showed that tumors with ring chromosomes relapsed more often than tumors with a balanced t(7;16), suggesting that ring formation in LGFMS is correlated with tumor progression.",1

20455749,"Microarray experiments generate massive amounts of data, necessitating innovative algorithms to distinguish biologically relevant information from noise. Because the variability of gene expression data is an important factor in determining which genes are differentially expressed, analysis techniques that take into account repeated measurements are critically important. Additionally, the selection of informative genes is typically done by searching for the individual genes that vary the most across conditions. Yet because genes tend to act in groups rather than individually, it may be possible to glean more information from the data by searching specifically for concerted behavior in a set of genes. Applying a symbolic transformation to the gene expression data allows the detection overrepresented patterns in the data, in contrast to looking only for genes that exhibit maximal differential expression. These challenges are approached by introducing an algorithm based on a new symbolic representation that searches for concerted gene expression patterns; furthermore, the symbolic representation takes into account the variance in multiple replicates and can be applied to long time series data. The proposed algorithm's ability to discover biologically relevant signals in gene expression data is exhibited by applying it to three datasets that measure gene expression in the rat liver.",0

20438648,"Emerging knowledge of whole prokaryotic transcriptomes could validate a number of theoretical concepts introduced in the early days of genomics. What are the rules connecting gene expression levels with sequence determinants such as quantitative scores of promoters and terminators? Are translation efficiency measures, e.g. codon adaptation index and RBS score related to gene expression? We used the whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing of a bacterial pathogen Bacillus anthracis to assess correlation of gene expression level with promoter, terminator and RBS scores, codon adaptation index, as well as with a new measure of gene translational efficiency, average translation speed. We compared computational predictions of operon topologies with the transcript borders inferred from RNA-Seq reads. Transcriptome mapping may also improve existing gene annotation. Upon assessment of accuracy of current annotation of protein-coding genes in the B. anthracis genome we have shown that the transcriptome data indicate existence of more than a hundred genes missing in the annotation though predicted by an ab initio gene finder. Interestingly, we observed that many pseudogenes possess not only a sequence with detectable coding potential but also promoters that maintain transcriptional activity.",0
20417861,"BCR/ABL1-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (CMPNs) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematological malignancies. Over recent years, some genetic events in tyrosine kinase (TK) genes have been described as causal events of these diseases. To identify new genetic aberrations underlying these diseases, we used denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to analyze 17 genes from two receptor-TK families (III and IV) and from three cytoplasmic-TK families (Syk, Abl, and Jak) on samples from 44 BCR/ABL1-negative and JAK2(V617F)-negative CMPN patients with different clinical phenotypes. Although screening by FISH did not reveal novel chromosomal aberrations, several sequence changes were detected. None of them were frequent events, but we identified a new potential activating mutation in the FERM domain of JAK2(R340Q). None of the germline JAK2(V617F) single-nucleotide polymorphisms detected differed in distribution between patients and control subjects. In summary, data presented here show that these genes are not frequently mutated or rearranged in CMPNs, suggesting that molecular events causing these disorders must be located in other genes.",1

20396904,"Heterozygous mutations of the gene encoding transcription factor OTX2 were recently shown to be responsible for ocular as well as pituitary abnormalities. Here, we describe a patient with unilateral anophthalmia and short stature. Endocrine evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis revealed isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) with small anterior pituitary gland, invisible stalk, ectopic posterior lobe, and right anophthalmia on brain magnetic resonance imaging. DNA was analyzed for mutations in the HESX1, SOX2, and OTX2 genes. Molecular analysis yielded a novel heterozygous OTX2 mutation (c.270A>T, p.R90S) within the homeodomain. Functional analysis revealed that the mutation inhibited both the DNA binding and transactivation activities of the protein. This novel loss-of-function mutation is associated with anophthalmia and IGHD in a patient of Sephardic Jewish descent. We recommend that patients with GH deficiency and ocular malformation in whom genetic analysis for classic transcription factor genes (PROP1, POU1F1, HESX1, and LHX4) failed to identify alterations should be checked for the presence of mutations in the OTX2 gene.",1

We present results of a genome-wide association study of 979 advanced AMD cases and 1,709 controls using the Affymetrix 6.0 platform with replication in seven additional cohorts (totaling 5,789 unrelated cases and 4,234 unrelated controls). We also present a comprehensive analysis of copy-number variations and polymorphisms for AMD. Our discovery data implicated the association between AMD and a variant in the hepatic lipase gene (LIPC) in the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) pathway (discovery P = 4.53e-05 for rs493258). Our LIPC association was strongest for a functional promoter variant, rs10468017, (P = 1.34e-08), that influences LIPC expression and serum HDL levels with a protective effect of the minor T allele (HDL increasing) for advanced wet and dry AMD. The association we found with LIPC was corroborated by the Michigan/Penn/Mayo genome-wide association study; the locus near the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 was corroborated by our replication cohort for rs9621532 with P = 3.71e-09. We observed weaker associations with other HDL loci (ABCA1, P = 9.73e-04; cholesterylester transfer protein, P = 1.41e-03; FADS1-3, P = 2.69e-02). Based on a lack of consistent association between HDL increasing alleles and AMD risk, the LIPC association may not be the result of an effect on HDL levels, but it could represent a pleiotropic effect of the same functional component. Results implicate different biologic pathways than previously reported and provide new avenues for prevention and treatment of AMD.",1

20360969,"Organismal development and many cell biological processes are organized in a modular fashion, where regulatory molecules form groups with many interactions within a group and few interactions between groups. Thus, the activity of elements within a module depends little on elements outside of it. Modularity facilitates the production of heritable variation and of evolutionary innovations. There is no consensus on how modularity might evolve, especially for modules in development. We show that modularity can increase in gene regulatory networks as a byproduct of specialization in gene activity. Such specialization occurs after gene regulatory networks are selected to produce new gene activity patterns that appear in a specific body structure or under a specific environmental condition. Modules that arise after specialization in gene activity comprise genes that show concerted changes in gene activities. This and other observations suggest that modularity evolves because it decreases interference between different groups of genes. Our work can explain the appearance and maintenance of modularity through a mechanism that is not contingent on environmental change. We also show how modularity can facilitate co-option, the utilization of existing gene activity to build new gene activity patterns, a frequent feature of evolutionary innovations.",0

20238422,"Annotating genes is a fundamental issue in the post-genomic era. A typical procedure for this issue is first clustering genes by their features and then assigning functions of unknown genes by using known genes in the same cluster. A lot of genomic information are available for this issue, but two major types of data which can be measured for any gene are microarray expressions and sequences, both of which however have their own flaws. Thus a natural and promising approach for gene annotation is to integrate these two data sources, especially in terms of their costs to be optimized in clustering. We develop an efficient gene annotation method with three steps containing spectral clustering over the integrated cost, based on the idea of network modularity. We rigorously examined the performance of our proposed method from three different viewpoints. All experimental results indicate the performance advantage of our method over possible clustering/classification-based approaches of gene function annotation, using expressions and/or sequences.",0
20220849,"Prostate cancer (CaP) progresses from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia through locally invasive adenocarcinoma to castration-resistant metastatic carcinoma. Although radical prostatectomy, radiation and androgen ablation are effective therapies for androgen-dependent CaP, metastatic castration-resistant CaP is a major complication with high mortality. Androgens stimulate growth and survival of prostate epithelium and early CaP. Although most patients initially respond to androgen ablation, many develop castration-resistant CaP within 12-18 months. Despite extensive studies, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of castration-resistant CaP remain poorly understood and their elucidation is critical for developing improved therapies. Curiously, castration-resistant CaP remains androgen-receptor dependent, and potent androgen-receptor antagonists induce tumour regression in castrated mice. The role of inflammation in castration-resistant CaP has not been addressed, although it was reported that intrinsic NF-kappaB activation supports its growth. Inflammation is a localized protective reaction to injury or infection, but it also has a pathogenic role in many diseases, including cancer. Whereas acute inflammation is critical for host defence, chronic inflammation contributes to tumorigenesis and metastatic progression. The inflammation-responsive IkappaB kinase (IKK)-beta and its target NF-kappaB have important tumour-promoting functions within malignant cells and inflammatory cells. The latter, including macrophages and lymphocytes, are important elements of the tumour microenvironment, but the mechanisms underlying their recruitment remain obscure, although they are thought to depend on chemokine and cytokine production. We found that CaP progression is associated with inflammatory infiltration and activation of IKK-alpha, which stimulates metastasis by an NF-kappaB-independent, cell autonomous mechanism. Here we show that androgen ablation causes infiltration of regressing androgen-dependent tumours with leukocytes, including B cells, in which IKK-beta activation results in production of cytokines that activate IKK-alpha and STAT3 in CaP cells to enhance hormone-free survival.",1
20212171,"Through its binding with protein S (PS), a key element of the coagulation/fibrinolysis cascade, the C4b-binding protein (C4BP) has been hypothesized to be involved in the susceptibility to venous thrombosis (VT). To identify genetic factors that may influence the plasma levels of the 3 C4BP existing isoforms, alpha(7)beta(1), alpha(6)beta(1), and alpha(7)beta(0), we conducted a genome-wide association study by analyzing 283 437 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia (GAIT) study composed of 352 persons. Three SNPs at the C4BPB/C4BPA locus were found genome-wide significantly associated with alpha(7)beta(0) levels. One of these SNPs was further found to explain approximately 11% of the variability of mRNA C4BPA expression in the Gutenberg Heart Study composed of 1490 persons, with no effect on C4BPB mRNA expression. The allele associated with increased alpha(7)beta(0) plasma levels and increased C4BPA expression was further found associated with increased risk of VT (odds ratio [OR] = 1.24 [1.03-1.53]) in 2 independent case-control studies (MARseille THrombosis Association study [MARTHA] and FActeurs de RIsque et de récidives de la maladie thromboembolique VEineuse [FARIVE]) gathering 1706 cases and 1379 controls. This SNP was not associated with free PS or total PS. In conclusion, we observed strong evidence that the C4BPB/C4BPA locus is a new susceptibility locus for VT through a PS-independent mechanism that remains to be elucidated.",1

Constitutional DNA of each subject was genotyped using the Illumina 1M beadchip. Fifteen SNPs yielded P < 10(-5), but in two independent replication series, no SNP passed a replication threshold of P < 0.05. Candidate gene GABRA2, which encodes the GABA receptor alpha2 subunit, was evaluated independently. Five SNPs at GABRA2 yielded nominal (uncorrected) P < 0.05, with odds ratios between 1.11 and 1.16.

20200238,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease. The identification and characterization of key host cellular factors that play a role in the HCV replication cycle are important for the understanding of disease pathogenesis and the identification of novel antiviral therapeutic targets. Gene expression profiling of JFH-1-infected Huh7 cells by microarray analysis was performed to identify host cellular genes that are transcriptionally regulated by infection. The expression of host genes involved in cellular defense mechanisms (apoptosis, proliferation, and antioxidant responses), cellular metabolism (lipid and protein metabolism), and intracellular transport (vesicle trafficking and cytoskeleton regulation) was significantly altered by HCV infection. The gene expression patterns identified provide insight into the potential mechanisms that contribute to HCV-associated pathogenesis. These include an increase in proinflammatory and proapoptotic signaling and a decrease in the antioxidant response pathways of the infected cell. To investigate whether any of the host genes regulated by infection were required by HCV during replication, small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of host gene expression in HCV-infected cells was performed. Decreasing the expression of host genes involved in lipid metabolism (TXNIP and CYP1A1 genes) and intracellular transport (RAB33b and ABLIM3 genes) reduced the replication and secretion of HCV, indicating that they may be important factors for the virus replication cycle. These results show that major changes in the expression of many different genes in target cells may be crucial in determining the outcome of HCV infection.",1
20195608,"Despite recent progress in molecular research in myeloid malignancies, in subsets of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) so far no underlying mutation was identified. In the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), the JAK2V617F alone cannot explain the phenotypic heterogeneity. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), clinical variability exists within distinct subgroups. Thus, the search for novel molecular markers continues. Recently, mutations of the tet oncogene family member 2 (TET2) and Casitas B-cell lymphoma (CBL) genes became the focus of interest. With diverse genetic methods, TET2 on chromosome 4q24 was identified as candidate tumor suppressor gene. Sequencing studies revealed heterogeneous mutations in 10-25% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), MDS, and MPNs, while the frequency might be higher in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The prognostic impact is being explored. The CBL gene is involved in the degradation of tyrosine kinases. In rare cases of human AML (<2%), CBL mutants were identified, with a higher frequency in core binding factor leukemias. Presence of these mutations was suggested to be involved in aberrant FLT3 expression. In the MPNs, a 2-8% frequency of CBL mutations was reported. These novel mutations deepened insights in the mechanisms of leukemogenesis, might contribute to the identification of new therapeutic targets, and improve diagnostics in the myeloid malignancies.",1
20194423,"The evolution of duplicate genes has been a topic of broad interest. Here, we propose that the conservation of gene family size is a good indicator of the rate of sequence evolution and some other biological properties. By comparing the human-chimpanzee-macaque orthologous gene families with and without family size conservation, we demonstrate that genes with family size conservation evolve more slowly than those without family size conservation. Our results further demonstrate that both family expansion and contraction events may accelerate gene evolution, resulting in elevated evolutionary rates in the genes without family size conservation. In addition, we show that the duplicate genes with family size conservation evolve significantly more slowly than those without family size conservation. Interestingly, the median evolutionary rate of singletons falls in between those of the above two types of duplicate gene families. Our results thus suggest that the controversy on whether duplicate genes evolve more slowly than singletons can be resolved when family size conservation is taken into consideration. Furthermore, we also observe that duplicate genes with family size conservation have the highest level of gene expression/expression breadth, the highest proportion of essential genes, and the lowest gene compactness, followed by singletons and then by duplicate genes without family size conservation. Such a trend accords well with our observations of evolutionary rates. Our results thus point to the importance of family size conservation in the evolution of duplicate genes.",0
20190752,"We performed a second-generation genome-wide association study of 4,533 individuals with celiac disease (cases) and 10,750 control subjects. We genotyped 113 selected SNPs with P(GWAS) < 10(-4) and 18 SNPs from 14 known loci in a further 4,918 cases and 5,684 controls. Variants from 13 new regions reached genome-wide significance (P(combined) < 5 x 10(-8)); most contain genes with immune functions (BACH2, CCR4, CD80, CIITA-SOCS1-CLEC16A, ICOSLG and ZMIZ1), with ETS1, RUNX3, THEMIS and TNFRSF14 having key roles in thymic T-cell selection. There was evidence to suggest associations for a further 13 regions. In an expression quantitative trait meta-analysis of 1,469 whole blood samples, 20 of 38 (52.6%) tested loci had celiac risk variants correlated (P < 0.0028, FDR 5%) with cis gene expression.",1
20185149,"We have performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia in a Norwegian discovery sample of 201 cases and 305 controls (TOP study) with a focused replication analysis in a larger European sample of 2663 cases and 13,780 control subjects (SGENE-plus study). Firstly, the discovery sample was genotyped with Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 and 572,888 markers were tested for schizophrenia association. No SNPs in the discovery sample attained genome-wide significance (P<8.7 x 10(-8)). Secondly, based on the GWAS data, we selected 1000 markers with the lowest P values in the discovery TOP sample, and tested these (or HapMap-based surrogates) for association in the replication sample. Sixteen loci were associated with schizophrenia (nominal P value<0.05 and concurring OR) in the replication sample. As a next step, we performed a combined analysis of the findings from these two studies, and the strongest evidence for association with schizophrenia was provided for markers rs7045881 on 9p21, rs433598 on 16p12 and rs10761482 on 10q21. The markers are located in PLAA, ACSM1 and ANK3, respectively. PLAA has not previously been described as a susceptibility gene, but 9p21 is implied as a schizophrenia linkage region. ACSM1 has been identified as a susceptibility gene in a previous schizophrenia GWAS study. The association of ANK3 with schizophrenia is intriguing in light of recent associations of ANK3 with bipolar disorder, thereby supporting the hypothesis of an overlap in genetic susceptibility between these psychopathological entities.",1
20177704,"Though p53, BRCA1, ATM, PIK3CA, and HER2 genes are shown to be involved in various aspects of breast carcinogenesis, their functional relationship and clinical value are still disputable.

20173732,"Previously, we showed that PIK3CA and p53 alterations in uterine endometrial carcinomas correlate with poor prognosis. However, the contribution of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) -AKT deregulation to endometrial carcinogenesis is not completely understood. The purpose of this study was to analyze alterations of this pathway in endometrial carcinomas and correlate them with the most common genetic abnormalities. Expression profiling of 22 genes involved in PI3K-AKT signaling pathway was analyzed in 38 endometrial carcinomas using TaqMan low-density array (TLDA) analysis. The gene expression pattern was analyzed by hierarchical clustering analysis. Unsupervised clustering divided the high-grade endometrial carcinomas into two clusters. One cluster identified tumors with alterations in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway (exon 20 PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN mutations 9/15; 60%), and p16 protein overexpression (8/13; 62%). Almost all non-endometrioid adenocarcinomas (serous and clear cell adenocarcinomas) were segregated into this cluster. In contrast, the other cluster identified tumors with p53 alterations (6/6; 100%), p16 protein overexpression (5/5; 100%), and exon 9 PIK3CA mutations (2/6; 33%). Exon 20 PIK3CA and PTEN mutations were not found in this subgroup. Low-grade endometrial carcinomas clustered in a third subgroup characterized by high frequency of PTEN mutations (10/17; 59%) and microsatellite instability (6/17; 35%). Our results show that gene expression profile differences in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway identify two subgroups of high-grade endometrial carcinomas with different molecular alterations (PI3K-AKT pathway vs p53 alterations) that may have distinct roles in endometrial carcinogenesis. Identification of these subgroups can provide insight into the biology of these tumors and may facilitate the development of future treatments.",1
20159113,"Genetic risk for multiple sclerosis (MS) is thought to involve both common and rare risk alleles. Recent GWAS and subsequent meta-analysis have established the critical role of the HLA locus and identified new common variants associated to MS. These variants have small odds ratios (ORs) and explain only a fraction of the genetic risk. To expose potentially rare, high-impact alleles, we conducted a GWAS of 68 distantly related cases and 136 controls from a high-risk internal isolate of Finland with increased prevalence and familial occurrence of MS. The top 27 loci with p < 10(-4) were tested in 711 cases and 1029 controls from Finland, and the top two findings were validated in 3859 cases and 9110 controls from more heterogeneous populations. SNP (rs744166) within the STAT3 gene was associated to MS (p = 2.75 x 10(-10), OR 0.87, confidence interval 0.83-0.91). The protective haplotype for MS in STAT3 is a risk allele for Crohn disease, implying that STAT3 represents a shared risk locus for at least two autoimmune diseases. This study also demonstrates the potential of special isolated populations in search for variants contributing to complex traits.",1

However, pNN50 is only one member of a larger family of pNNx statistics, where x is greater than 0 msec. The potential application of the general pNNx statistics has not yet been explored in the psychiatric field. The authors examined the pNNx statistics in clozapine-treated subjects and normal controls to evaluate the usefulness of the general pNNx statistics.",1
20135100,"Astronauts returning from space flight and performing Earth-bound activities must rapidly transition from the microgravity-adapted sensorimotor state to that of Earth's gravity. The goal of the current study was to assess locomotor dysfunction and recovery of function after long-duration space flight using a test of functional mobility. Eighteen International Space Station crewmembers experiencing an average flight duration of 185 days performed the functional mobility test (FMT) pre-flight and post-flight. To perform the FMT, subjects walked at a self selected pace through an obstacle course consisting of several pylons and obstacles set up on a base of 10-cm-thick, medium-density foam for a total of six trials per test session. The primary outcome measure was the time to complete the course (TCC, in seconds). To assess the long-term recovery trend of locomotor function after return from space flight, a multilevel exponential recovery model was fitted to the log-transformed TCC data. All crewmembers exhibited altered locomotor function after space flight, with a median 48% increase in the TCC. From the fitted model we calculated that a typical subject would recover to 95% of his/her pre-flight level at approximately 15 days post-flight. In addition, to assess the early motor learning responses after returning from space flight, we modeled performance over the six trials during the first post-flight session by a similar multilevel exponential relation. We found a significant positive correlation between measures of long-term recovery and early motor learning (P < 0.001) obtained from the respective models. We concluded that two types of recovery processes influence an astronaut's ability to re-adapt to Earth's gravity environment. Early motor learning helps astronauts make rapid modifications in their motor control strategies during the first hours after landing. Further, this early motor learning appears to reinforce the adaptive realignment, facilitating re-adaptation to Earth's 1-g environment on return from space flight.",0
20130577,"Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the CHD (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding domain) member CHD7, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller homologous to the Drosophila trithorax-group protein Kismet, result in a complex constellation of congenital anomalies called CHARGE syndrome, which is a sporadic, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by malformations of the craniofacial structures, peripheral nervous system, ears, eyes and heart. Although it was postulated 25 years ago that CHARGE syndrome results from the abnormal development of the neural crest, this hypothesis remained untested. Here we show that, in both humans and Xenopus, CHD7 is essential for the formation of multipotent migratory neural crest (NC), a transient cell population that is ectodermal in origin but undergoes a major transcriptional reprogramming event to acquire a remarkably broad differentiation potential and ability to migrate throughout the body, giving rise to craniofacial bones and cartilages, the peripheral nervous system, pigmentation and cardiac structures. We demonstrate that CHD7 is essential for activation of the NC transcriptional circuitry, including Sox9, Twist and Slug. In Xenopus embryos, knockdown of Chd7 or overexpression of its catalytically inactive form recapitulates all major features of CHARGE syndrome. In human NC cells CHD7 associates with PBAF (polybromo- and BRG1-associated factor-containing complex) and both remodellers occupy a NC-specific distal SOX9 enhancer and a conserved genomic element located upstream of the TWIST1 gene. Consistently, during embryogenesis CHD7 and PBAF cooperate to promote NC gene expression and cell migration. Our work identifies an evolutionarily conserved role for CHD7 in orchestrating NC gene expression programs, provides insights into the synergistic control of distal elements by chromatin remodellers, illuminates the patho-embryology of CHARGE syndrome, and suggests a broader function for CHD7 in the regulation of cell motility.",1
20130071,"Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are genetically heterogeneous tumors of neural crest origin. Approximately half of these tumors activate a pseudohypoxic transcription response, which is due in a minority of the cases to germline mutations of the VHL gene or the genes encoding subunits of the metabolic enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), SDHB, SDHC, or SDHD. However, the genetic basis of the hypoxic-like profile of the remaining tumors is undetermined. Mutations in genes involved in the energy metabolism, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and -2 (IDH2) and SDHAF2, a component of SDH, can mimic a pseudohypoxic state.",1
20114151,"The fundamental processes involved in the mechanism of hearing seem to be controlled by hundreds of genes and hereditary hearing impairment may be caused by a large variety of genetic mutations in different genes.

The identification of these genes and functional analysis of the proteins they encode, are paving the way towards a better understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of the auditory system. To date, approximately 50 causative genes have been identified.",0
20102925,"Previous methods to quantify dyssynchrony could not determine regional 3-dimensional (3-D) strain. We hypothesized that a novel 3-D speckle tracking strain imaging system can quantify left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony and site of latest mechanical activation. We studied 64 subjects; 54 patients with heart failure were referred for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with an ejection fraction 25 +/- 6% and QRS interval 165 +/- 29 ms and 10 healthy volunteer controls. The 3-D speckle tracking system determined radial strain using a 16-segment model from a pyramidal 3-D dataset. Dyssynchrony was quantified as maximal opposing wall delay and SD in time to peak strain. The 3-D analysis was compared to standard 2-dimensional (2-D) strain datasets and site of 3-D latest mechanical activation, not possible by 2D was quantified. As expected, dyssynchrony in patients on CRT was significantly greater than in controls (maximal opposing wall delay 316 +/- 112 vs 59 +/- 12 ms and SD 124 +/- 48 vs 28 +/- 11 ms, p <0.001 vs normal). The 3-D opposing wall delay was closely correlated with 3-D 16-segment SD (r = 0.95) and 2-D mid-LV strain (r = 0.83) and SD (r = 0.85, all p values <0.001). The 3-D site of the latest mechanical activation was most commonly midposterior (26%), basal posterior (22%), midlateral (20%), and basal lateral (17%). Eleven patients studied after CRT demonstrated improvements in 3-D synchrony (300 +/- 124 to 94 +/- 37 ms) and ejection fraction (24 +/- 6% to 31 +/- 7%, p <0.05). In conclusion, 3-D speckle tracking can successfully quantify 3-D dyssynchrony and site the latest mechanical activation. This approach may play a clinical role in management of patients on CRT.",0
20098682,"Recently a number of randomized trials have shown that patients with advanced colorectal cancer do not benefit from therapies targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor when their tumors harbor mutations in the KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA genes. We developed two multiplex assays that simultaneously screen 22 nucleotides in the KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA genes for mutations. The assays were validated on 294 tumor DNA samples from patients with advanced colorectal cancer. In these samples 119 KRAS codon 12 and 13 mutations had been identified by sequence analysis, 126 tumors were wild-type for KRAS and the analysis failed in 49 of the 294 samples due to poor DNA quality. The two mutation assays detected 130 KRAS mutations, among which were 3 codon 61 mutations, and in addition 32 PIK3CA, 13 BRAF and 6 NRAS mutations. In 19 tumors a KRAS mutation was found together with a mutation in the PIK3CA gene. One tumor was mutant for both PIK3CA and BRAF. In summary, the mutations assays identified 161 tumors with a mutation, 120 were wild-type and the analysis failed in 13. The material cost of the 2 mutation assays was calculated to be 8-fold lower than the cost of sequencing required to obtain the same data. In addition, the mutation assays are less labor intensive. We conclude that the performance of the two multiplex mutation assays was superior to direct sequencing. In addition, these assays are cheaper and easier to interpret. The assays may also be of use for selection of patients with other tumor types.",1
20073072,"A total of 176 genes homozygously deleted in human lung cancer were identified by DNA array-based whole genome scanning of 52 lung cancer cell lines and subsequent genomic PCR in 74 cell lines, including the 52 cell lines scanned. One or more exons of these genes were homozygously deleted in one (1%) to 20 (27%) cell lines. These genes included known tumor suppressor genes, e.g., CDKN2A/p16, RB1, and SMAD4, and candidate tumor suppressor genes whose hemizygous or homozygous deletions were reported in several types of human cancers, such as FHIT, KEAP1, and LRP1B/LRP-DIP. CDKN2A/p16 and p14ARF located in 9p21 were most frequently deleted (20/74, 27%). The PTPRD gene was most frequently deleted (8/74, 11%) among genes mapping to regions other than 9p21. Somatic mutations, including a nonsense mutation, of the PTPRD gene were detected in 8/74 (11%) of cell lines and 4/95 (4%) of surgical specimens of lung cancer. Reduced PTPRD expression was observed in the majority (>80%) of cell lines and surgical specimens of lung cancer. Therefore, PTPRD is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in lung cancer. Microarray-based expression profiling of 19 lung cancer cell lines also indicated that some of the 176 genes, such as KANK and ADAMTS1, are preferentially inactivated by epigenetic alterations. Genetic/epigenetic as well as functional studies of these 176 genes will increase our understanding of molecular mechanisms behind lung carcinogenesis.",1
20072603,"Osteoporosis is a major public health problem. It is mainly characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and/or low-trauma osteoporotic fractures (OF), both of which have strong genetic determination. The specific genes influencing these phenotypic traits, however, are largely unknown. Using the Affymetrix 500K array set, we performed a case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 700 elderly Chinese Han subjects (350 with hip OF and 350 healthy matched controls). A follow-up replication study was conducted to validate our major GWAS findings in an independent Chinese sample containing 390 cases with hip OF and 516 controls. We found that a SNP, rs13182402 within the ALDH7A1 gene on chromosome 5q31, was strongly associated with OF with evidence combined GWAS and replication studies (P = 2.08x10(-9), odds ratio = 2.25). In order to explore the target risk factors and potential mechanism underlying hip OF risk, we further examined this candidate SNP's relevance to hip BMD both in Chinese and Caucasian populations involving 9,962 additional subjects. This SNP was confirmed as consistently associated with hip BMD even across ethnic boundaries, in both Chinese and Caucasians (combined P = 6.39x10(-6)), further attesting to its potential effect on osteoporosis. ALDH7A1 degrades and detoxifies acetaldehyde, which inhibits osteoblast proliferation and results in decreased bone formation. Our findings may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of osteoporosis.",1

20034088,"We identified in a large Tunisian pedigree a novel UBE3A frameshift mutation in exon 16 coding region, and we expect that the resulting UBE3A truncated protein in our patients is non-functional since the mutation implies the catalytic region of the enzyme. The family includes 14 affected patients born from four sisters. This mutation was found in all surviving affected individuals and their mothers pointing out the importance of genetic counseling possibility in Angelman syndrome (AS). All patients had severe mental retardation with epilepsy and microcephaly. Minor clinical expression variation was observed among the investigated patients. The severity of clinical expression is related to the detected molecular variation: deletion of 15 bp and insertion of 7 bp. These results are concordant with the gene expression observed in previously reported individuals with AS and truncated UBE3A protein.",1

20022634,"The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases PI3K/AKT pathway regulates many growth and survival mechanisms in the cell, and it has been implicated in development and progression of many human cancers, including multiple myeloma. Recently, many reports have revealed that the PIK3CA gene which encodes the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K kinase is mutated in many human malignancies. To investigate the oncogenic role of PI3K/AKT pathway in multiple myeloma we sequenced three hot exons: exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA gene and exon 3 of AKT1 gene in 27 multiple myeloma patients. Our results indicate the absence of the four hot spot mutations E542K, E545K, H1047R and E17K in all studied cases. These findings suggest that PI3K/AKT mutations may not play a major role in multiple myeloma.",1

A novel region on chromosome 11 containing olfactory receptor genes OR51B5 and OR51B6 was identified by 6 SNPs (lowest P = 4.7E-08) and validated in the replication set. An additional olfactory receptor gene, OR51B2, was identified by a novel SNP set enrichment analysis. Genome-wide association studies also validated a previously identified SNP (rs766432) in BCL11A, a gene known to affect fetal hemoglobin levels (P = 2.6E-21) and in Thailand and Hong Kong subjects.

20008458,"Pairs of unidirectional (same strand) genes can overlap in one of two phases (relative reading frames). There is a striking bias in the relative abundance of prokaryotic gene overlaps in the two possible phases. A simple model is presented based on unidirectional gene overlaps evolving from nonoverlapping gene pairs, through the adoption of alternative start codons by the downstream genes. Potential alternative start codons within upstream gene sequences were found to occur at greater frequencies in one phase, corresponding to the most prevalent phase of gene overlaps. We therefore suggest that the phase bias of overlapping genes is primarily a consequence of the N-terminal extension of downstream genes through adoption of new start codons.",0

19965379,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is an orally active agent for treatment of disorders of copper metabolism. Here we describe how TM inhibits proteins that regulate copper physiology. Crystallographic results reveal that the surprising stability of the drug complex with the metallochaperone Atx1 arises from formation of a sulfur-bridged copper-molybdenum cluster reminiscent of those found in molybdenum and iron sulfur proteins. Spectroscopic studies indicate that this cluster is stable in solution and corresponds to physiological clusters isolated from TM-treated Wilson's disease animal models. Finally, mechanistic studies show that the drug-metallochaperone inhibits metal transfer functions between copper-trafficking proteins. The results are consistent with a model wherein TM can directly and reversibly down-regulate copper delivery to secreted metalloenzymes and suggest that proteins involved in metal regulation might be fruitful drug targets.",0

However, two of the three hostage-taking situations ended violently; therefore, the implications of the high-probability request sequence for hostage-taking situations should be assessed in future research.",0
19933569,"Earlier studies have revealed that both mechanical context and feedback determine what mechanical invariant is used to perceive length by dynamic touch. In the present article, the authors examined how these two factors jointly constrain the informational variable that is relied upon. Participants were to judge length while wielding a rod or while holding it stationary. In two experiments, it was tested whether perceptual learning effects in the wielding condition transferred to the holding condition and vice versa. There was an asymmetry in transfer across mechanical conditions: Improvements in the holding context transferred to the wielding condition, but not vice versa. Examining the individuals' exploitation of mechanical variables, we found that, after feedback, participants changed in information usage in both mechanical conditions. For many participants, these changes were not confined to the mechanical context in which the feedback was provided. Indeed, feedback in one mechanical context brought about changes in information usage that often manifested themselves in the other mechanical condition. The authors explore the implications of these findings for research on perceptual learning in dynamic touch and the salience hypothesis.",0

All three samples showed evidence of association implicating the Trichohyalin gene (TCHH), which is expressed in the developing inner root sheath of the hair follicle, and explaining approximately 6% of variance (p=1.5x10(-31)). These variants are at their highest frequency in Northern Europeans, paralleling the distribution of the straight-hair EDAR variant in Asian populations.",1
19861517,"The somatic fusion of TMPRSS2 to ETS oncogenes is a common event in prostate cancer (PCa). We hypothesized that defects in DNA repair may lead to an increase of chromosomal rearrangements and thus to the occurrence of ETS oncogene fusion. We have previously conducted a genome-wide linkage analysis in TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive PCa families, revealing potential susceptibility loci on chromosomes 5q14, 9q21, 10q26, 11q24, 12q15, 13q12, 18q, and Xq27. In the present study, nine candidate genes from these regions were selected from the context of DNA repair and screened for mutations in TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive families. Thirteen nonsynonymous variants, 5 of which had a minor allele frequency of <0.05, were genotyped in 210 familial cases, 47 of which with a known TMPRSS2-ERG status, 329 sporadic cases, and 512 controls. Significant association of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive PCa was found with rare variants in the genes for POLI [variant F532S: P = 0.0011; odds ratios (OR), 4.62; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.84-11.56] and ESCO1 (variant N191S: P = 0.0034; OR, 4.27; 95% CI, 1.62-11.28). Additional findings, regardless of TMPRSS2-ERG status, were the overrepresentation of a rare BRCA2 variant (V2728I: P = 0.03; OR, 6.16; 95% CI, 1.19-32.00) in familial PCa and of a common allele of RMI1 (variant N455S: P = 0.02; OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.04-1.70) in unselected PCa cases. The DNA repair genes POLI and ESCO1 are proposed as susceptibility genes for TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive PCa that warrant further investigation.",1
19859843,"An extremely rare case of primary small cell carcinoma of the pleura with an emphasis on KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRA) genes is reported here. A 67-year-old man underwent left testicular orchiectomy because of a testicular tumor. The tumor was immunohistochemically shown to be diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The patient was treated with chemotherapy and radiation and followed up in our hospital. Eight years after the orchiectomy, the patient (75 years old) developed left pleural tumor and pleural effusion, and a biopsy was performed. The biopsy revealed a medullary malignant tumor consisting of small round and spindle cells. The following three possibilities were considered: recurrent lymphoma, mesothelioma, and small cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin, synaptophysin, CD56, KIT, and PDGFRA, but negative for CEA, cytokeratin 5/6, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin, CD45, CD3, CD20, CD45RO, CD15, CD30, calretinin, WT-1, B72.3, D2-40, and TTF-1. Therefore, a diagnosis of pleural small cell carcinoma was made. A molecular genetic analysis using PCR-direct sequencing identified no mutations of KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17) and PDGFRA (exons 12 and 18) genes. The patient was treated with chemotherapy (cisplatin) and radiation (50 Gray). The present case is the first reported case of primary small cell carcinoma of the pleura with an examination of KIT and PDGFRA expressions and KIT and PDGFRA gene mutations.",1
19851299,"As major risk-factors for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, the genetic contribution to obesity-related traits has been of interest for decades. Recently, a limited number of common genetic variants, which have replicated in different populations, have been identified. One approach to increase the statistical power in genetic mapping studies is to focus on populations with increased levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and reduced genetic diversity. We have performed joint linkage and genome-wide association analyses for weight and BMI in 3,448 (linkage) and 3,925 (association) partly overlapping healthy individuals from five European populations. A total of four chromosomal regions (two for weight and two for BMI) showed suggestive linkage (lod >2.69) either in one of the populations or in the joint data. At the genome-wide level (nominal P < 1.6 x 10(-7), Bonferroni-adjusted P < 0.05) one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs12517906) (nominal P = 7.3 x 10(-8)) was associated with weight, whereas none with BMI. The SNP associated with weight is located close to MGAT1. The monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) enzyme family is known to be involved in dietary fat absorption. There was no overlap between the linkage regions and the associated SNPs. Our results show that genetic effects influencing weight and BMI are shared across diverse European populations, even though some of these populations have experienced recent population bottlenecks and/or been affected by genetic drift. The analysis enabled us to identify a new candidate gene, MGAT1, associated with weight in women.",1
19847810,"Aberrant activation of wingless (Wnt) signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of various cancers. Recent studies suggested a role of Wnt signaling in gliomas, the most common primary brain tumors. We investigated 70 gliomas of different malignancy grades for promoter hypermethylation in 8 genes encoding members of the secreted frizzled-related protein (SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP4, SFRP5), dickkopf (DKK1, DKK3) and naked (NKD1, NKD2) families of Wnt pathway inhibitors. All tumors were additionally analyzed for mutations in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1). While none of the tumors carried CTNNB1 mutations, we found frequent promoter hypermethylation of Wnt pathway inhibitor genes, with at least one of these genes being hypermethylated in 6 of 16 diffuse astrocytomas (38%), 4 of 14 anaplastic astrocytomas (29%), 7 of 10 secondary glioblastomas (70%) and 23 of 30 primary glioblastomas (77%). Glioblastomas often demonstrated hypermethylation of 2 or more analyzed genes. Hypermethylation of SFRP1, SFRP2 and NKD2 each occurred in more than 40% of the primary glioblastomas, while DKK1 hypermethylation was found in 50% of secondary glioblastomas. Treatment of SFRP1-, SFRP5-, DKK1-, DKK3-, NKD1- and NKD2-hypermethylated U87-MG glioblastoma cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A resulted in increased expression of each gene. Furthermore, SFRP1-hypermethylated gliomas showed significantly lower expression of the respective transcripts when compared with unmethylated tumors. Taken together, our results suggest an important role of epigenetic silencing of Wnt pathway inhibitor genes in astrocytic gliomas, in particular, in glioblastomas, with distinct patterns of hypermethylated genes distinguishing primary from secondary glioblastomas.",1
19841262,"The transcription factor gene MYB was identified recently as an oncogene that is rearranged/duplicated in some human leukemias. Here we describe a new mechanism of activation of MYB in human cancer involving gene fusion. We show that the t(6;9)(q22-23;p23-24) translocation in adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC) of the breast and head and neck consistently results in fusions encoding chimeric transcripts predominantly consisting of MYB exon 14 linked to the last coding exon(s) of NFIB. The minimal common part of MYB deleted as the result of fusion was exon 15 including the 3'-UTR, which contains several highly conserved target sites for miR-15a/16 and miR-150 microRNAs. These microRNAs recently were shown to regulate MYB expression negatively. We suggest that deletion of these target sites may disrupt repression of MYB leading to overexpression of MYB-NFIB transcripts and protein and to activation of critical MYB targets, including genes associated with apoptosis, cell cycle control, cell growth/angiogenesis, and cell adhesion. Forced overexpression of miR-15a/16 and miR-150 in primary fusion-positive ACC cells did not significantly alter the expression of MYB as compared with leukemic cells with MYB activation/duplication. Our data indicate that the MYB-NFIB fusion is a hallmark of ACC and that deregulation of the expression of MYB and its target genes is a key oncogenic event in the pathogenesis of ACC. Our findings also suggest that the gain-of-function activity resulting from the MYB-NFIB fusion is a candidate therapeutic target.",1
19840939,"Mechanical stimulation can prevent adipogenic and improve osteogenic lineage allocation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), an effect associated with the preservation of beta-catenin levels. We asked whether mechanical up-regulation of beta-catenin was critical to reduction in adipogenesis as well as other mechanical events inducing alternate MSC lineage selection. In MSC cultured under strong adipogenic conditions, mechanical load (3600 cycles/day, 2% strain) inactivated GSK3beta in a Wnt-independent fashion. Small interfering RNA targeting GSK3beta prevented both strain-induced induction of beta-catenin and an increase in COX2, a factor associated with increased osteoprogenitor phenotype. Small interfering RNA knockdown of beta-catenin blocked mechanical reduction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and adiponectin, implicating beta-catenin in strain inhibition of adipogenesis. In contrast, the effect of both mechanical and pharmacologic inhibition of GSK3beta on the putative beta-catenin target, COX2, was unaffected by beta-catenin knockdown. GSK3beta inhibition caused accumulation of nuclear NFATc1; mechanical strain increased nuclear NFATc1, independent of beta-catenin. NFATc1 knockdown prevented mechanical stimulation of COX2, implicating NFATc1 signaling. Finally, inhibition of GSK3beta caused association of RNA polymerase II with the COX2 gene, suggesting transcription initiation. These results demonstrate that mechanical inhibition of GSK3beta induces activation of both beta-catenin and NFATc1 signaling, limiting adipogenesis via the former and promoting osteoblastic differentiation via NFATc1/COX2. Our novel findings suggest that mechanical loading regulates mesenchymal stem cell differentiation through inhibition of GSK3beta, which in turn regulates multiple downstream effectors.",1
19815178,"The quest to understand the relationship between an organism's DNA sequence and three-dimensional form is an interdisciplinary task, integrating diverse fields of the life sciences. The relevance of the metaphor of a genotype-phenotype map is explored from a developmental perspective, in light of the recent concept of a ""molecular toolkit"" of protein-coding genes, and the widespread view that analyzing the logic and mechanics of gene regulation at multiple levels is key to explaining how morphology is genetically encoded. We discuss the challenges of decoding genomes despite variable genetic backgrounds, the dynamically changing physical and molecular contexts of the internal environment during development, and the impact of external forces on morphogenesis.",0
19812673,"Although autism is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder, attempts to identify specific susceptibility genes have thus far met with limited success. Genome-wide association studies using half a million or more markers, particularly those with very large sample sizes achieved through meta-analysis, have shown great success in mapping genes for other complex genetic traits. Consequently, we initiated a linkage and association mapping study using half a million genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a common set of 1,031 multiplex autism families (1,553 affected offspring). We identified regions of suggestive and significant linkage on chromosomes 6q27 and 20p13, respectively. Initial analysis did not yield genome-wide significant associations; however, genotyping of top hits in additional families revealed an SNP on chromosome 5p15 (between SEMA5A and TAS2R1) that was significantly associated with autism (P = 2 x 10(-7)). We also demonstrated that expression of SEMA5A is reduced in brains from autistic patients, further implicating SEMA5A as an autism susceptibility gene. The linkage regions reported here provide targets for rare variation screening whereas the discovery of a single novel association demonstrates the action of common variants.",1
19801978,"Lineage-survival oncogenes are activated by somatic DNA alterations in cancers arising from the cell lineages in which these genes play a role in normal development. Here we show that a peak of genomic amplification on chromosome 3q26.33 found in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the lung and esophagus contains the transcription factor gene SOX2, which is mutated in hereditary human esophageal malformations, is necessary for normal esophageal squamous development, promotes differentiation and proliferation of basal tracheal cells and cooperates in induction of pluripotent stem cells. SOX2 expression is required for proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of lung and esophageal cell lines, as shown by RNA interference experiments. Furthermore, ectopic expression of SOX2 here cooperated with FOXE1 or FGFR2 to transform immortalized tracheobronchial epithelial cells. SOX2-driven tumors show expression of markers of both squamous differentiation and pluripotency. These characteristics identify SOX2 as a lineage-survival oncogene in lung and esophageal SCC.",1
19789115,"Predicting gene functions is a challenge for biologists in the postgenomic era. Interactions among genes and their products compose networks that can be used to infer gene functions. Most previous studies adopt a linkage assumption, i.e., they assume that gene interactions indicate functional similarities between connected genes. In this study, we propose to use a gene's context graph, i.e., the gene interaction network associated with the focal gene, to infer its functions. In a kernel-based machine-learning framework, we design a context graph kernel to capture the information in context graphs. Our experimental study on a testbed of p53-related genes demonstrates the advantage of using indirect gene interactions and shows the empirical superiority of the proposed approach over linkage-assumption-based methods, such as the algorithm to minimize inconsistent connected genes and diffusion kernels.",1
19787250,"Microsatellite instability (MSI) is an indicator of DNA instability and is caused by abnormalities in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes such as hMLH1, hMSH2 and hMSH6. MSI occurs frequently in endometrial cancer (in approximately 30% of cases), and accumulation of gene mutations due to MSI may therefore have a major role in the mechanism of malignant transformation. However, a responsible target gene has not been identified in endometrial cancer. In this study, we analyzed mutations in 11 cancer-related genes with mononucleotide repeats susceptible to MSI in a coding region [hMSH3 (A8), hMSH6 (C8), TGF-beta RII (A10), MBD4 (A10), BAX (G8), PTEN (A6 in exon 7), HDAC2 (A9), EPHB2 (A9), Caspase-5 (A10), TCF-4 (A9) and Axin2 (G7)] in 22 patients with MSI-H sporadic endometrial cancer. Mutations in hMSH6 (C8) and TGF-beta RII (A10) were found most frequently, at rates of 36.3% (8/22) each. Mutations of BAX (G8) and TCF-4 (A9), which are common in MSI-positive colorectal cancer, occurred at rates of 22.7 and 0%, respectively, which suggests that the MSI target gene may differ between endometrial and colorectal cancers. Mutations in hMSH6 (C8) were correlated with reduced protein expression (p=0.042) and patients with these mutations had significantly more mutations in mononucleotide repeats in other cancer-related genes compared to patients without hMSH6 (C8) mutations (p=0.042). This suggests the possibility of a novel cascade in carcinogenesis of endometrial cancer in which MSI mutates hMSH6 (C8), increases gene instability, and leads to accumulation of mutations in other cancer-related genes. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that hMSH6 (C8) has an important role as an MSI target gene in sporadic endometrial cancer.",1

19748573,"Morphogenesis, the process by which all complex biological structures are formed, is driven by an intricate interplay between genes, growth, as well as intra- and intercellular forces. While the expression of different genes changes the mechanical properties and shapes of cells, growth exerts forces in response to which tissues, organs and more complex structures are shaped. This is exemplified by a number of recent findings for instance in meristem formation in Arabidopsis and tracheal tube formation in Drosophila. However, growth not only generates forces, mechanical forces can also have an effect on growth rates, as is seen in mammalian tissues or bone growth. In fact, mechanical forces can influence the expression levels of patterning genes, allowing control of morphogenesis via mechanical feedback. In order to study the connections between mechanical stress, growth control and morphogenesis, information about the distribution of stress in a tissue is invaluable. Here, we applied stress-birefringence to the wing imaginal disc of Drosophila melanogaster, a commonly used model system for organ growth and patterning, in order to assess the stress distribution present in this tissue. For this purpose, stress-related differences in retardance are measured using a custom-built optical set-up. Applying this method, we found that the stresses are inhomogeneously distributed in the wing disc, with maximum compression in the centre of the wing pouch. This compression increases with wing disc size, showing that mechanical forces vary with the age of the tissue. These results are discussed in light of recent models proposing mechanical regulation of wing disc growth.",0
19708400,"The Statistics Anxiety Rating Scale and the Attitudes Toward Statistics questionnaire were administered to 226 university of technology students. The former scale measures anxiety about learning statistics in terms of Worth of Statistics, Interpretation Anxiety, Test and Class Anxiety, Computational Self-concept, Fear of Asking for Help, and Fear of Statistics Teachers. The latter measures attitudes toward use of statistics and statistics course for which a student was registered. These African students were enrolled in Taxation, Marketing, or Accounting. Participants took a required course in statistics intended to improve statistical skills. There were 150 women and 57 men, chosen because they had no previous mathematics learning. Students' ages ranged between 16 and 26 years (M = 20.1, SD = 2.0). There were no statistically significant sex differences on attitudes and anxiety toward statistics, but there were significant differences among areas of study programs.",0
19708342,"Persistent organic pollutant (POP) concentrations were measured in stack-gases of ferrous scrap processing steel plants with electric arc furnaces (EAFs) (n = 5) in Aliaga, Izmir, Turkey and in air (n = 11) at a site near those plants. Measured stack-gas concentrations for the four plants without scrap preheating (611 +/- 311, 165,000 +/- 285,000, and 33 +/- 3 ng m(-3), average +/- SD for sigma41PCBs, sigma16PAHs, and sigma7PBDEs, respectively) indicated that they are significant sources for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). POP emissions from the plant with scrap preheating were significantly higher (13 500, 445 000, and 91 ng m(-3) for sigma41PCBs, sigma16PAHs, and sigma7PBDEs, respectively). It was also shown that the steel plants emit considerable amounts of fugitive POPs in particle-phase. Estimated emissions using the emission factors generated in this study and the production amounts suggested that the steel plants with EAFs may significantly contribute to local and global PAH, PCB, and PBDE emissions. Several other compounds (aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and chlorine-containing organic compounds, n = 49) were identified and determined semiquantitatively in the stack-gas and ambient air samples. Ambient air concentrations (62 +/- 35, 320 +/- 134 ng m(-3), 1451 +/- 954 pg m(-3), for sigma41PCBs, sigma16PAHs, and sigma7PBDEs, respectively) were significantly higher than those measured previously around the world and in the region, further confirming that the steel plants with EAFs are ""hot spots"" for POPs.",0

19688096,"The fundamental difference between classic and modern biology is that technological innovations allow to generate high-throughput data to get insights into molecular interactions on a genomic scale. These high-throughput data can be used to infer gene networks, e.g., the transcriptional regulatory or signaling network, representing a blue print of the current dynamical state of the cellular system. However, gene networks do not provide direct answers to biological questions, instead, they need to be analyzed to reveal functional information of molecular working mechanisms. In this paper we propose a new approach to analyze the transcriptional regulatory network of yeast to predict cell cycle regulated genes. The novelty of our approach is that, in contrast to all other approaches aiming to predict cell cycle regulated genes, we do not use time series data but base our analysis on the prior information of causal interactions among genes. The major purpose of the present paper is to predict cell cycle regulated genes in S. cerevisiae. Our analysis is based on the transcriptional regulatory network, representing causal interactions between genes, and a list of known periodic genes. No further data are used. Our approach utilizes the causal membership of genes and the hierarchical organization of the transcriptional regulatory network leading to two groups of periodic genes with a well defined direction of information flow. We predict genes as periodic if they appear on unique shortest paths connecting two periodic genes from different hierarchy levels. Our results demonstrate that a classical problem as the prediction of cell cycle regulated genes can be seen in a new light if the concept of a causal membership of a gene is applied consequently. This also shows that there is a wealth of information buried in the transcriptional regulatory network whose unraveling may require more elaborate concepts than it might seem at first.",0

In the human psoriasis xenograft mouse model, blockade of IL-21 activity resolves inflammation and reduces keratinocyte proliferation. Blocking IL-21 may represent a new therapeutic strategy in psoriasis.",1

19672874,"The current multistep carcinogenesis models of colon cancer do not fully capture the genetic heterogeneity of the disease, which is additionally complicated by the presence of passenger and driver genetic alterations. The aim of this study was to select in the context of this significant heterogeneity additional genes functionally related to colon cancer development. High-throughput copy number and gene expression data of 36 microsatellite stable sporadic colon cancers resected from patients of a single institution characterized for mutations in APC, KRAS, TP53 and loss of 18q were analyzed. Genes whose expression correlated with the underlying copy number pattern were selected, and their association with the above listed mutations and overall survival was evaluated. Gain of 20q was strongly associated with TP53 mutation, and overall survival with alterations on 7p, 8p, 13q, 18q, and 20q. An association with 18q loss and gain of 8q24 was also observed. New candidate genes with a potential role in colon cancer are PLCG1 on 20q, DBC1 on 8q21, and NDGR1 on 8p24. In addition, an unexpected pattern of loss and mutability was found in the region upstream of the KRAS gene. By integrating copy number alterations with gene expression and mutations in colon cancer associated genes, we have developed a strategy that identifies previously known molecular features and additional players in the molecular landscape of colon cancer.",1
19672358,"Understanding statistical terminology and the ability to appraise clinical research findings and statistical tests are critical to the practice of evidence-based medicine. Urologists require statistics in their toolbox of skills in order to successfully sift through increasingly complex studies and realize the drawbacks of statistical tests. Currently, the level of evidence in urology literature is low and the majority of research abstracts published for the American Urological Association (AUA) meetings lag behind for full-text publication because of a lack of statistical reporting. Underlying these issues is a distinct deficiency in solid comprehension of statistics in the literature and a discomfort with the application of statistics for clinical decision-making. This review examines the plight of statistics in urology and investigates the reason behind the white-coat aversion to biostatistics. Resources such as evidence-based medicine websites, primers in statistics, and guidelines for statistical reporting exist for quick reference by urologists. Ultimately, educators should take charge of monitoring statistical knowledge among trainees by bolstering competency requirements and creating sustained opportunities for statistics and methodology exposure.",0
19668216,"Phosphotidylinositol (PtdIns) signaling is tightly regulated both spatially and temporally by subcellularly localized PtdIns kinases and phosphatases that dynamically alter downstream signaling events. Joubert syndrome is characterized by a specific midbrain-hindbrain malformation ('molar tooth sign'), variably associated retinal dystrophy, nephronophthisis, liver fibrosis and polydactyly and is included in the newly emerging group of 'ciliopathies'. In individuals with Joubert disease genetically linked to JBTS1, we identified mutations in the INPP5E gene, encoding inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase E, which hydrolyzes the 5-phosphate of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(4,5)P2. Mutations clustered in the phosphatase domain and impaired 5-phosphatase activity, resulting in altered cellular PtdIns ratios. INPP5E localized to cilia in major organs affected by Joubert syndrome, and mutations promoted premature destabilization of cilia in response to stimulation. These data link PtdIns signaling to the primary cilium, a cellular structure that is becoming increasingly recognized for its role in mediating cell signals and neuronal function.",1
19665600,"Molecular mechanism of mechanical stress-induced bone formation remains unclear. We demonstrate that mechanical unloading suppresses and reloading enhances Interleukin (IL)-11 gene expression in the hindlimb of mice in vivo. Mechanical stress to osteoblasts by fluid shear stress (FSS) in vitro rapidly and transiently enhances fosB gene transcription, stimulates binding of DeltaFosB/JunD complex to activator protein (AP)-1 site of the IL-11 gene promoter, and enhances IL-11 gene transcription. Anti-IL-11 antibody blocks mechanical stress-induced enhancement of osteoblastogenesis and suppression of adipogenesis, suggesting the requirement of IL-11 for the stimulation of osteoblast differentiation by mechanical stress. Down-regulation of DeltaFosB/JunD by small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppresses and overexpression of DeltaFosB/JunD enhances IL-11 gene promoter activity. Consistent with our previous observations that up-regulation of DeltaFosB depends upon activation of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) via Ca(2+)-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) to phosphorylate CREB, mechanical stress-induced activation of IL-11 gene transcription is dependent upon Ca(2+)-ERK pathway. Present results also demonstrated that FSS to osteoblasts enhances canonical Wnt signaling in vitro, and that mechanical unloading induces and reloading suppresses the expression of a canonical Wnt signal inhibitor, dickkopf2 (Dkk2), in vivo. In addition, IL-11 siRNA enhances Dkk2 expression suppressed by FSS, and osteoblasts from IL-11 transgenic mice show reduced Dkk2 mRNA expression than those from wild-type mice. These observations are consistent with the notion that mechanical stress stimulates IL-11 gene transcription via an enhanced DeltaFosB/JunD binding to the IL-11 gene promoter, and that increased IL-11 enhances canonical Wnt signal at least in part via a reduction in Dkk2 expression to stimulate osteoblast differentiation.",1
19648920,"We conducted a genome-wide association study on 969 bladder cancer cases and 957 controls from Texas. For fast-track validation, we evaluated 60 SNPs in three additional US populations and validated the top SNP in nine European populations. A missense variant (rs2294008) in the PSCA gene showed consistent association with bladder cancer in US and European populations. Combining all subjects (6,667 cases, 39,590 controls), the overall P-value was 2.14 x 10(-10) and the allelic odds ratio was 1.15 (95% confidence interval 1.10-1.20). rs2294008 alters the start codon and is predicted to cause truncation of nine amino acids from the N-terminal signal sequence of the primary PSCA translation product. In vitro reporter gene assay showed that the variant allele significantly reduced promoter activity. Resequencing of the PSCA genomic region showed that rs2294008 is the only common missense SNP in PSCA. Our data identify rs2294008 as a new bladder cancer susceptibility locus.",1
19648161,"Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma (NLPHL) shows constitutive NF-kappaB activity in the malignant lymphocyte-predominant (LP) cells. Constitutive NF-kappaB activity also plays a central pathogenetic role in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL), where inactivating mutations in the NFKBIA and TNFAIP3 genes, coding for the negative NF-kappaB regulators IkappaBalpha and A20, respectively, contribute to NF-kappaB activation. To determine whether mutations in NFKBIA and TNFAIP3 are also involved in the pathogenesis of NLPHL these genes were sequenced from microdissected LP cells of 10 primary NLPHL. We also studied DEV, the only cell line proposedly derived from LP cells, after we had confirmed its derivation from NLPHL by gene expression analysis. A heterozygous somatic missense mutation in the NFKBIA gene was found in one NLPHL, and a heterozygous, possibly subclonal, two base pair insertion in TNFAIP3 in another case. The low mutation frequency and the absence of biallelic destructive mutations propose a minor contribution of NFKBIA and TNFAIP3 mutations to the NF-kappaB activity of NLPHL, suggesting different mechanisms of NF-kappaB activation in NLPHL and cHL.",1
19634011,"The human ACSM1, 2A and B, 3, and 5 genes, located on chromosome 16p12-13, encode for enzymes catalyzing the activation of medium-chain length fatty acids. Association studies have linked several polymorphisms of these genes to traits of insulin resistance syndrome. In our study, ACSM transcripts showed 3 to >400-fold higher expression levels in human liver when compared to cell lines by qRT-PCR. This difference was also evident at the protein level, as shown for ACSM2. In liver, ACSM2 was the most abundant transcript, showing sixfold (vs. ACSM3) to >300-fold higher expression levels (vs. ACSM1). Mitochondrial localization of the ACSM2 protein and the presence of an N-terminal targeting sequence were shown by GFP-tagging. We have shown ACSM2B to be the predominant transcript in human liver, and genetic variations of this gene could therefore play an important role in disease susceptibility.",1
19615464,"Tazarotene-induced protein 3 (TIG3) and HRAS-like suppressor family 2 (HRASLS2) exhibit tumor-suppressing activities and belong to the lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) protein family. Since Ca(2+)-independent N-acyltransferase and H-rev107 (another tumor suppressor), both of which are members of the LRAT family, have been recently reported to possess catalytic activities related to phospholipid metabolism, we examined possible enzyme activities of human TIG3 and HRASLS2 together with human H-rev107. The purified recombinant proteins of TIG3, HRASLS2, and H-rev107 functioned as phospholipase (PL) A(1/2) in a Ca(2+)-independent manner with maximal activities of 0.53, 0.67, and 2.57 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively. The proteins were active with various phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), and for most of substrates the PLA(1) activity was much higher than the PLA(2) activity. In addition, HRASLS2 catalyzed N-acylation of PE to form N-acyl-PE and O-acylation of lyso PC to form PC. TIG3 and H-rev107 catalyzed the N-acylation and O-acylation at relatively low rates. Moreover, these three proteins showed different expression profiles in human tissues. These results suggest that the tumor suppressors TIG3, HRASLS2 and H-rev107 are involved in the phospholipid metabolism with different physiological roles.",1

Mutations in TP53, PTEN, PIK3CA, CTNNB1/beta-catenin genes and deletion of CDKN2A-ARF (p14(ARF)-p16(NK4a I) ) locus were investigated in sixteen primary primary effusion lymphoma tumors and seven primary effusion lymphoma cell lines using PCR and sequencing. TP53 mutations were detected in one primary primary effusion lymphoma tumor (6.2%) and two primary effusion lymphoma cell lines (28.6%). BC-3 and BCP-1 cell lines showed PTEN gene mutations, associated with a loss of PTEN protein expression in both cases. No mutations were detected in PIK3CA and CTNNB1/beta-catenin hotspot sequences. Only BC-3 contained a homozygous deletion of CDKN2A-ARF locus. Although detected at a higher frequency in primary effusion lymphoma cell lines than in primary primary effusion lymphoma tumors, TP53 and/or PTEN mutations, as well as deletion of CDKN2A-ARF locus are uncommon in primary effusion lymphoma, and are found to correlate with the EBV-negative status of primary effusion lymphoma tumors.",1
19605634,"The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated in decision-making under uncertainty, but it is unknown how information about the probability or uncertainty of future reward is coded by single orbitofrontal neurons and ensembles. We recorded neuronal ensembles in rat OFC during an olfactory discrimination task in which different odor stimuli predicted different reward probabilities. Single-unit firing patterns correlated to the expected reward probability primarily within an immobile waiting period before reward delivery but also when the rat executed movements toward the reward site. During these pre-reward periods, a subset of OFC neurons was sensitive to differences in probability but only very rarely discriminated on the basis of reward uncertainty. In the reward period, neurons responded during presentation or omission of reward or during both types of outcome. At the population level, neurons were characterized by a wide divergence in firing-rate variability attributable to expected probability. A population analysis using template matching as reconstruction method indicated that OFC generates a distributed representation of reward probability with a weak dependence on neuronal group size. The analysis furthermore confirmed that predictive information coded by OFC populations was quantitatively related to reward probability, but not to uncertainty.",0
19596466,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether impaired ankle function after total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) affects the mechanical work during the step-to-step transition and the metabolic cost of walking. Respiratory and force plate data were recorded in 11 patients and 11 healthy controls while they walked barefoot at a fixed walking speed (FWS, 1.25 m/s) and at their self-selected speed (SWS). At FWS metabolic cost of transport was 28% higher for the TAA group, but at SWS there was no significant increase. During the step-to-step transition, positive mechanical work generated by the trailing TAA leg was lower and negative mechanical work in the leading intact leg was larger. Despite the increase in mechanical work dissipation during double support, no significant differences in total mechanical work were found over a complete stride. This might be a result of methodological limitations of calculating mechanical work. Nevertheless, mechanical work dissipated during the step-to-step transition at FWS correlated significantly with metabolic cost of transport: r=.540. It was concluded that patients after successful TAA still experienced an impaired lower leg function, which contributed to an increase in mechanical energy dissipation during the step-to-step transition, and to an increase in the metabolic demand of walking.",0
19592580,"Microdeletion at chromosomal position 15q13.3 has been described in intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia and recently in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). Using independent IGE cohorts, we first aimed to confirm the association of 15q13.3 deletions and IGE. We then set out to determine the relative occurrence of sporadic and familial cases and to examine the likelihood of having seizures for individuals with the microdeletion in familial cases. The 15q13.3 microdeletion was identified in 7 of 539 (1.3%) unrelated cases of IGE using quantitative PCR or SNP arrays and confirmed by array comparative genomic hybridization analysis using probes specific to the 15q13.3 region. The inheritance of this lesion was tracked using family studies. Of the seven microdeletions identified in probands, three were de novo, two were transmitted from an unaffected parent and in two cases the parents were unavailable. Non-penetrance of the microdeletion was identified in 4/7 pedigrees and three pedigrees included other family members with IGE who lacked the 15q13.3 deletion. The odds ratio is 68 (95% confidence interval 29-181), indicating a pathogenic lesion predisposing to epilepsy with complex inheritance and incomplete penetrance for the IGE component of the phenotype in multiplex families.",1
19582852,"Bone cells live in an environment heavily influenced by mechanical forces. Systematic study of cell's mechanical responses has relied greatly on the in-vitro experiments due to complexity of internal environment of bone cells in vivo. A loading device suitable to hard scaffolds for studying mechanical responses of bone cells was made by using a kind of long-travel, high-load piezoelectric actuator. The device, which was precisely controlled by computer, and designed to work in an incubator at 37 degrees C and 100% humidity, can cause hard scaffolds with directly compressive strains with more magnitudes, frequency components, and waveforms, including bone physiologically mechanical state. The experiment using hard scaffolds indicates the device validity. The device represents a versatile model that will provide conditions for investigating the effects of mechanical responses on bone cells in 3D hard scaffolds in vitro. In addition, the preliminary biological test was performed by the application of the device. The results showed that the dynamic compression with the amplitude of 1000 microstrain, the frequency of 3 Hz, the duration of 3 min/day enhanced the osteoblastic proliferation and extracellular matrix compared with static conditions, and improved the cell distribution within scaffolds. The researches of 3D mechanical effects on bone cells just in hard scaffolds similar to that in cancellous bone can enhance the understanding of bone physiology in vivo. The direct, dynamic contact-loading of the device may provide an appropriate mechanical condition in bone tissue engineering culture.",0
19577618,"Gene regulatory changes are thought to be major factors driving species evolution, with creation of new regulatory regions likely being instrumental in contributing to diversity among vertebrates. There is growing appreciation for the role of transposable elements (TEs) in gene regulation and, indeed, laboratory investigations have confirmed many specific examples of mammalian genes regulated by promoters donated by endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) or other TEs. Bioinformatics studies have revealed hundreds of additional instances where this is likely to be the case. Since the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of retroviruses naturally contain abundant transcriptional regulatory signals, roles for ERV LTRs in regulating mammalian genes are eminently plausible. Moreover, it seems reasonable that exaptation of an LTR regulatory module provides opportunities for evolution of new gene regulatory patterns. In this Review we summarize known examples of LTRs that function as human gene alternative promoters, as well as the evidence that LTR exaptation has resulted in a pattern of novel gene expression significantly different from the pattern before LTR insertion or from that of gene orthologs lacking the LTR. Available data suggest that, while new expression patterns can arise as a result of LTR usage, this situation is relatively rare and is largely restricted to the placenta. In many cases, the LTR appears to be a minor, alternative promoter with an expression pattern similar to that of the native promoter(s) and hence likely exerts a subtle overall effect on gene expression. We discuss these findings and offer evolutionary models to explain these trends.",0
19562677,"Hyperglycemia and deriving from glomerular hypertension mechanical stress are the key factors underlying pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Multiple direct and secondary effects of both these factors are mediated by complex signaling pathways with extensive interactions. The common signaling pathways stimulated by high glucose and mechanical insult may act in an additive manner, thereby accelerating the cell damage. Podocytes, the cells covering the outer aspect of glomerular basement membrane (GBM), are subjected not only to the load of filtered glucose but also to diverse mechanical forces. Bulging into the Bowman's space, they have no support from the apical side, which makes them particularly susceptible to the effects of mechanical strain. Both high glucose and mechanical stress may impair the protein systems anchoring the podocyte foot processes in GBM, therefore blunting resistance of these cells to mechanical forces. Modulation by these factors of expression and activity of numerous structural and functional proteins results in the (auto)inflammatory responses, dysfunction, apoptosis or necrosis of the podocytes. Loss of the podocytes is irreversible due to their inability to proliferate and to replenish damaged cells. Podocytes are injured early in the course of DN, which, most likely, underlies further glomerular and renal damage in diabetes. This review summarizes the effects of elevated glucose and mechanical stress that seem to be involved in podocyte impairment in diabetes, with particular focus on the possible interactions between these factors.",1
19561606,"Kidney stone disease is a common condition. To search for sequence variants conferring risk of kidney stones, we conducted a genome-wide association study in 3,773 cases and 42,510 controls from Iceland and The Netherlands. We discovered common, synonymous variants in the CLDN14 gene that associate with kidney stones (OR = 1.25 and P = 4.0 x 10(-12) for rs219780[C]). Approximately 62% of the general population is homozygous for rs219780[C] and is estimated to have 1.64 times greater risk of developing the disease compared to noncarriers. The CLDN14 gene is expressed in the kidney and regulates paracellular permeability at epithelial tight junctions. The same variants were also found to associate with reduced bone mineral density at the hip (P = 0.00039) and spine (P = 0.0077).",1
19548526,"Centaurin beta5 with unclear function belongs to protein family of centaurins. Human centaurin beta5 is encoded by gene CENTB5 whose intron 14-15 contains low variable minisatellite UPS29, and mouse homolog CENTB5 in analogous intron contains imperfect microsatellite repeat (CATG)19. Earlier we found the association between an occurrence of short UPS29 alleles with some forms of Parkinson disease and epilepsy. Besides this, both human and mice CENTB5 are localized in the same synteny group with SCNN1D and ACOT7 genes which are known to be expressed predominantly in nervous system. Mutations in these genes are connected with neurodegenerative processes and epilepsy. It is known that intra-intronic sequences can modulate genes of their location and neighbor and even remote genes. Using RT-PCR we carried out simultaneous analysis of CENTB5, SCNN1D and ACOT7 genes expression. Potential possibility of human intra-intronic tandem repeat UPS29 and of mouse intra-intronic tandem repeat (CATG)19 to regulate/modulate CENTB5, SCNN1D and ACOT7 activity was evaluated in silico. It was found that all these genes were expressed in all studied organs and tissues. It is suggested that minisatellite locus UPS29 can regulate an activity of CENTB5, SCNN1D and ACOT7 in nervous system cells.",1

19508968,"To identify the susceptibility gene in hand osteoarthritis (OA) the authors used a two-stage approach genome-wide association study using two discovery samples (the TwinsUK cohort and the Rotterdam discovery subset; a total of 1804 subjects) and four replication samples (the Chingford Study, the Chuvasha Skeletal Aging Study, the Rotterdam replication subset and the Genetics, Arthrosis, and Progression (GARP) Study; a total of 3266 people). Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) had a likelihood of association with hand OA in the discovery stage and one of them (rs716508), was successfully confirmed in the replication stage (meta-analysis p = 1.81x10(-5)). The C allele conferred a reduced risk of 33% to 41% using a case-control definition. The SNP is located in intron 1 of the A2BP1 gene. This study also found that the same allele of the SNP significantly reduced bone density at both the hip and spine (p<0.01), suggesting the potential mechanism of the gene in hand OA might be via effects on subchondral bone. The authors' findings provide a potential new insight into genetic mechanisms in the development of hand OA.",1
19496244,"The evolution of the gene frequencies at a single multiallelic locus under the joint action of migration and viability selection with dominance is investigated. The monoecious, diploid population is subdivided into finitely many panmictic colonies that exchange adult migrants independently of genotype. Underdominance and overdominance are excluded. If the degree of dominance is deme independent for every pair of alleles, then under the Levene model, the qualitative evolution of the gene frequencies (i.e., the existence and stability of the equilibria) is the same as without dominance. In particular: (i) the number of demes is a generic upper bound on the number of alleles present at equilibrium; (ii) there exists exactly one stable equilibrium, and it is globally attracting; and (iii) if there exists an internal equilibrium, it is globally asymptotically stable. Analytic examples demonstrate that if either the Levene model does not apply or the degree of dominance is deme dependent, then the above results can fail. A complete global analysis of weak migration and weak selection on a recessive allele in two demes is presented.",0

19486858,"Kangri cancer is a unique, thermally induced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin that develops due to persistent use of a Kangri (a brazier) by the Kashmiri people to combat the cold temperature during winter. Unlike classical UV-induced SCC of the skin, Kangri cancer appears on the legs and abdomen. Its common features are erythematous patches, recurrence and metastasis. In the absence of any molecular etiology, we made a preliminary attempt to estimate the nature and frequency of mutations in the TP53 and PTEN genes in Kangri cancer patients from Kashmir. PCR-SSCP analysis followed by direct sequencing revealed that TP53 mutations account for 40% (12/30) of sporadic Kangri cancer patients and that PTEN mutations account for only 6.6% (2/30). There were 16 mutations in TP53 exons 5 and 7, found in 12 patients. They consisted of 11 substitutions (7 transitions, 3 transversions and 1 double-base) and 5 insertions. The 11 substitutions represent 8 distinct missense mutations, 3 of which were silent mutations. The mutations detected in the PTEN gene consisted of one insertion and one C>T transition. This high percentage of TP53 mutations (especially A>G) showed a statistically significant association with age and positive lymph node status. Our results indicate that TP53 is a predominant target of chronic hyperthermia in the development of Kangri cancer in the moderate risk Kashmiri population. The differences in the TP53 mutation spectrum of UV-induced SCC of the skin and Kangri cancer are probably due to the nature of the respective environmental carcinogens. The study also suggests that TP53 may function as a potential molecular marker and prognostic tool, at least in a subset of sporadic Kangri tumors.",1
19481195,"3-M syndrome is an autosomal-recessive primordial growth disorder characterized by significant intrauterine and postnatal growth restriction. Mutations in the CUL7 gene are known to cause 3-M syndrome. In 3-M syndrome patients that do not carry CUL7 mutations, we performed high-density genome-wide SNP mapping to identify a second locus at 2q35-q36.1. Further haplotype analysis revealed a 1.29 Mb interval in which the underlying gene is located and we subsequently discovered seven distinct null mutations from 10 families within the gene OBSL1. OBSL1 is a putative cytoskeletal adaptor protein that localizes to the nuclear envelope. We were also able to demonstrate that loss of OBSL1 leads to downregulation of CUL7, implying a role for OBSL1 in the maintenance of CUL7 protein levels and suggesting that both proteins are involved within the same molecular pathway.",1
19460962,"MicroRNAs (miRs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), leading to translational repression or degradation. Here, we show that the miR-17approximately92 cluster is highly expressed in human endothelial cells and that miR-92a, a component of this cluster, controls the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). Forced overexpression of miR-92a in endothelial cells blocked angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. In mouse models of limb ischemia and myocardial infarction, systemic administration of an antagomir designed to inhibit miR-92a led to enhanced blood vessel growth and functional recovery of damaged tissue. MiR-92a appears to target mRNAs corresponding to several proangiogenic proteins, including the integrin subunit alpha5. Thus, miR-92a may serve as a valuable therapeutic target in the setting of ischemic disease.",1
19451621,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a degenerative disorder of motor neurons that typically develops in the 6th decade and is uniformly fatal, usually within 5 years. To identify genetic variants associated with susceptibility and phenotypes in sporadic ALS, we performed a genome-wide SNP analysis in sporadic ALS cases and controls. A total of 288,357 SNPs were screened in a set of 1,821 sporadic ALS cases and 2,258 controls from the U.S. and Europe. Survival analysis was performed using 1,014 deceased sporadic cases. Top results for susceptibility were further screened in an independent sample set of 538 ALS cases and 556 controls. SNP rs1541160 within the KIFAP3 gene (encoding a kinesin-associated protein) yielded a genome-wide significant result (P = 1.84 x 10(-8)) that withstood Bonferroni correction for association with survival. Homozygosity for the favorable allele (CC) conferred a 14.0 months survival advantage. Sequence, genotypic and functional analyses revealed that there is linkage disequilibrium between rs1541160 and SNP rs522444 within the KIFAP3 promoter and that the favorable alleles of rs1541160 and rs522444 correlate with reduced KIFAP3 expression. No SNPs were associated with risk of sporadic ALS, site of onset, or age of onset. We have identified a variant within the KIFAP3 gene that is associated with decreased KIFAP3 expression and increased survival in sporadic ALS. These findings support the view that genetic factors modify phenotypes in this disease and that cellular motor proteins are determinants of motor neuron viability.",1
19449758,"Since sorivudine incident has happened in Japan in 1993, an adverse drug-drug interaction has been of special meanings at each step of new drug development including the discovery step, NDA process, and on market. While it is known that several mechanisms are involved in the drug-drug interactions, the mechanisms related to drug metabolism are 1) inhibition of drug metabolizing enzymes, 2) induction of the enzymes, 3) drug absorption, 4) renal excretion, 5) hepatic transport, and 6) protein binding (displacement) interaction. In this report, proposals to avoid serious/lethal drug-drug interactions are presented with the examples. The proposals are: 1) To estimate the drug-drug interactions in consideration of the mechanisms reported so far, 2) To be especially careful for drugs with a small therapeutic index and severe/lethal toxicity, 3) To estimate the drug-drug interactions in consideration of physiological factors of patients, who receive drugs in combination, 4) Not to leave the mechanism unclear, when some data, which do not deny the critical drug-drug interactions, were obtained, and 5) To conduct the drug-drug interaction studies in humans in careful consideration of the safety.",0
19447992,"Clinical mastitis (CM) can be caused by a wide variety of pathogens and farmers must start treatment before the actual causal pathogen is known. By providing a probability distribution for the causal pathogen, naive Bayesian networks (NBN) can serve as a management tool for farmers to decide which treatment to use. The advantage of providing a probability distribution for the causal pathogen, rather than only providing the most likely causal pathogen, is that the uncertainty involved is visible and a more informed treatment decision can be made. The objective of this study was to illustrate provision of probability distributions for the gram status and for the causal pathogen for CM cases. For constructing the NBN, data were used from 274 Dutch dairy herds in which the occurrence of CM was recorded over an 18-mo period. The data set contained information on 3,833 CM cases. Two-thirds of the data set was used for the construction process and one-third was retained for validation. One NBN was constructed with the CM cases classified according to their gram status, and another was built with the CM cases classified into streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, or Escherichia coli. Information usually available at a dairy farm was included in both NBN (parity, month in lactation, season of the year, quarter position, SCC and CM history, being sick or not, and color and texture of the milk). Accuracy was calculated to obtain insight in the quality of the constructed NBN. The accuracy of classifying CM cases into gram-positive or gram-negative pathogens was 73%, while the accuracy of classifying CM cases into streptococci, Staph. aureus, or E. coli was 52%. Because only CM cases with a high probability for a single causal pathogen will be considered for pathogen-specific treatment, accuracies based on only classifying CM cases above a particular probability threshold were determined. For instance, for CM cases in which either gram-negative or gram-positive had a probability >0.90, classification according to the gram status reached an accuracy of 97%. We found that the greater the probability for a particular pathogen was for a CM case, the more accurate was the classification of this case as being caused by this pathogen. The probability distributions provided by the NBN and the associated accuracies for varying classification thresholds provide the farmer with considerable insight about the most likely causal pathogen for a CM case and the uncertainty involved.",1
19435634,"Schizophrenia is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is thought to be induced by an interaction between predisposing genes and environmental stressors. To identify predisposing genetic factors, we performed a targeted (mostly neurodevelopmental) gene approach involving the screening of 396 selected non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three independent Caucasian schizophrenia case-control cohorts (USA, Denmark and Norway). A meta-analysis revealed ten non-synonymous SNPs that were nominally associated with schizophrenia, nine of which have not been previously linked to the disorder. Risk alleles are in TRKA (rs6336), BARD1 (rs28997576), LAMA5 (rs3810548), DKK2 (rs7037102), NOD2 (rs2066844) and RELN (rs2229860), whereas protective alleles are in NOD2 (rs2066845), NRG1 (rs10503929), ADAM7 (rs13259668) and TNR (rs859427). Following correction for multiple testing, the most attractive candidate for further study concerns SNP rs6336 (q=0.12) that causes the substitution of an evolutionarily highly conserved amino acid residue in the kinase domain of the neurodevelopmentally important receptor TRKA. Thus, TRKA signaling may represent a novel susceptibility pathway for schizophrenia.",1

19430481,"Despite rapid advances in the identification of genes involved in disease, the predictive power of the genotype remains limited, in part owing to poorly understood effects of second-site modifiers. Here we demonstrate that a polymorphic coding variant of RPGRIP1L (retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator-interacting protein-1 like), a ciliary gene mutated in Meckel-Gruber (MKS) and Joubert (JBTS) syndromes, is associated with the development of retinal degeneration in individuals with ciliopathies caused by mutations in other genes. As part of our resequencing efforts of the ciliary proteome, we identified several putative loss-of-function RPGRIP1L mutations, including one common variant, A229T. Multiple genetic lines of evidence showed this allele to be associated with photoreceptor loss in ciliopathies. Moreover, we show that RPGRIP1L interacts biochemically with RPGR, loss of which causes retinal degeneration, and that the Thr229-encoded protein significantly compromises this interaction. Our data represent an example of modification of a discrete phenotype of syndromic disease and highlight the importance of a multifaceted approach for the discovery of modifier alleles of intermediate frequency and effect.",1
19430480,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a common autoimmune disorder that arises from the action of multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. We report the findings of a genome-wide association study of T1D, combined in a meta-analysis with two previously published studies. The total sample set included 7,514 cases and 9,045 reference samples. Forty-one distinct genomic locations provided evidence for association with T1D in the meta-analysis (P < 10(-6)). After excluding previously reported associations, we further tested 27 regions in an independent set of 4,267 cases, 4,463 controls and 2,319 affected sib-pair (ASP) families. Of these, 18 regions were replicated (P < 0.01; overall P < 5 × 10(-8)) and 4 additional regions provided nominal evidence of replication (P < 0.05). The many new candidate genes suggested by these results include IL10, IL19, IL20, GLIS3, CD69 and IL27.",1
19429689,"Metagenomic sequencing projects yield numerous sequencing reads of a diverse range of uncultivated and mostly yet unknown microorganisms.

Orphelia is a program for predicting genes in short DNA sequences that is available through a web server application (http://orphelia.gobics.de). Orphelia utilizes prediction models that were created with machine learning techniques on the basis of a wide range of annotated genomes. In contrast to other methods for metagenomic gene prediction, Orphelia has fragment length-specific prediction models for the two most popular sequencing techniques in metagenomics, chain termination sequencing and pyrosequencing. These models ensure highly specific gene predictions.",0
19426955,"Asthma, a chronic airway disease with known heritability, affects more than 300 million people around the world. A genome-wide association (GWA) study of asthma with 359 cases from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) and 846 genetically matched controls from the Illumina ICONdb public resource was performed. The strongest region of association seen was on chromosome 5q12 in PDE4D. The phosphodiesterase 4D, cAMP-specific (phosphodiesterase E3 dunce homolog, Drosophila) gene (PDE4D) is a regulator of airway smooth-muscle contractility, and PDE4 inhibitors have been developed as medications for asthma. Allelic p values for top SNPs in this region were 4.3 x 10(-07) for rs1588265 and 9.7 x 10(-07) for rs1544791. Replications were investigated in ten independent populations with different ethnicities, study designs, and definitions of asthma. In seven white and Hispanic replication populations, two PDE4D SNPs had significant results with p values less than 0.05, and five had results in the same direction as the original population but had p values greater than 0.05. Combined p values for 18,891 white and Hispanic individuals (4,342 cases) in our replication populations were 4.1 x 10(-04) for rs1588265 and 9.2 x 10(-04) for rs1544791. In three black replication populations, which had different linkage disequilibrium patterns than the other populations, original findings were not replicated. Further study of PDE4D variants might lead to improved understanding of the role of PDE4D in asthma pathophysiology and the efficacy of PDE4 inhibitor medications.",1
19412164,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common form of lymphoma in adulthood, comprises multiple biologically and clinically distinct subtypes including germinal centre B-cell-like (GCB) and activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. Gene expression profile studies have shown that its most aggressive subtype, ABC-DLBCL, is associated with constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB transcription complex. However, except for a small fraction of cases, it remains unclear whether NF-kappaB activation in these tumours represents an intrinsic program of the tumour cell of origin or a pathogenetic event. Here we show that >50% of ABC-DLBCL and a smaller fraction of GCB-DLBCL carry somatic mutations in multiple genes, including negative (TNFAIP3, also called A20) and positive (CARD11, TRAF2, TRAF5, MAP3K7 (TAK1) and TNFRSF11A (RANK)) regulators of NF-kappaB. Of these, the A20 gene, which encodes a ubiquitin-modifying enzyme involved in termination of NF-kappaB responses, is most commonly affected, with approximately 30% of patients displaying biallelic inactivation by mutations and/or deletions. When reintroduced in cell lines carrying biallelic inactivation of the gene, A20 induced apoptosis and cell growth arrest, indicating a tumour suppressor role. Less frequently, missense mutations of TRAF2 and CARD11 produce molecules with significantly enhanced ability to activate NF-kappaB. Thus, our results demonstrate that NF-kappaB activation in DLBCL is caused by genetic lesions affecting multiple genes, the loss or activation of which may promote lymphomagenesis by leading to abnormally prolonged NF-kappaB responses.",1
19409525,"The vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific isoform of alpha-actin (ACTA2) is a major component of the contractile apparatus in SMCs located throughout the arterial system. Heterozygous ACTA2 mutations cause familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD), but only half of mutation carriers have aortic disease. Linkage analysis and association studies of individuals in 20 families with ACTA2 mutations indicate that mutation carriers can have a diversity of vascular diseases, including premature onset of coronary artery disease (CAD) and premature ischemic strokes (including Moyamoya disease [MMD]), as well as previously defined TAAD. Sequencing of DNA from patients with nonfamilial TAAD and from premature-onset CAD patients independently identified ACTA2 mutations in these patients and premature onset strokes in family members with ACTA2 mutations. Vascular pathology and analysis of explanted SMCs and myofibroblasts from patients harboring ACTA2 suggested that increased proliferation of SMCs contributed to occlusive diseases. These results indicate that heterozygous ACTA2 mutations predispose patients to a variety of diffuse and diverse vascular diseases, including TAAD, premature CAD, ischemic strokes, and MMD. These data demonstrate that diffuse vascular diseases resulting from either occluded or enlarged arteries can be caused by mutations in a single gene and have direct implications for clinical management and research on familial vascular diseases.",1
19407556,"Granulosa cell tumors (GCT) are a unique subset of ovarian tumors which have a molecular phenotype resembling that of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)-stimulated pre-ovulatory granulosa cells. FSH acts via its receptor to stimulate signaling pathways including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway. Activation of this pathway occurs in solid tumors, including ovarian epithelial tumors, through mutation of the PI3K subunit genes or inactivation of the tumor suppressor, PTEN. Activation of this pathway would be predicted to be tumorigenic in granulosa cells.Expression of the 2 PI3K subunit genes, PIK3CA, which encodes the catalytic subunit, and PIK3R1, which encodes the regulatory subunit, together with the PTEN gene was determined in a panel of GCT, 2 human GCT-derived cell lines, COV434 and KGN, and normal ovary. Direct sequence analysis was used to screen for mutations. Expression of all 3genes was observed in the GCT without evidence of overexpression for the PI3K subunit genes or loss of expression for PTEN. Sequence analysis of amplicons spanning exons 9and 20, in which greater than 75% of mutations occur in the PIK3CA gene did not identify any missense mutations. Similarly, the previously reported deletions in exons 12 and 13 of the PIK3R1 were not found in the GCT. Three amplicons spanning the entire coding sequence of the PTEN gene were sequenced; neither deletions nor mutations were identified.These findings suggest that activation of PI3K signaling through PI3K/PTEN mutation or altered expression, in contrast to many other types of solid tumor, is not associated with GCT.",1
19378006,"Backcross breeding enables breeders to transfer a desired trait such as a transgene from one variety (donor parent, DP) into the favored genetic background of another (recurrent parent, RP). If the trait of interest is produced by a dominant gene, this process involves four rounds of backcrossing within seven seasons. If the gene is recessive, this process requires more generations of selfing and thus nine or more seasons are needed. The rate at which the DP genes are removed and the RP genes are recovered in the genetic makeup of the plant can be calculated using the number of backcross generations utilized. This rate is dramatically increased with the recent advances in marker technology which allow breeders to control the gene of interest and control the genetic background.",0

19358278,"Cigarette smoking has been identified as a risk factor for rectal cancer. Our investigation evaluates associations between active and passive smoking and TP53, KRAS2, and BRAF V600E mutations, microsatellite instability (MSI), and CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) in rectal tumors. We examine how genetic variants of GSTM1 and NAT2 alter these associations in a population-based, case-control study of 750 incident rectal cancer cases and 1,201 controls. Detailed tobacco exposure data were collected in an extensive questionnaire. DNA from blood was examined for GSTM1 and NAT2 variants. Tumor DNA was assessed to determine TP53 (exons 5-8), KRAS2 (codons 12-13) and BRAF mutations, MSI (BAT26 and TGFbetaRII analysis), and CIMP (methylation of CpG islands in CDKN2A, MLH1, MINT1, MINT2 and MINT31). Cigarette smoking (>20 pack-years, relative to nonsmokers) was associated with increased risk of TP53 mutations (OR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.02-2.0), BRAF mutations (OR = 4.2, 95% CI 1.3-14.2) and MSI (OR = 5.7, 95% CI 1.1-29.8) in rectal tumors. Long-term environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure of >10 hr/wk was associated with increased risk of KRAS2 mutation (OR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.04-2.2). All smoking indicators were suggestive of increased risk in CIMP+ rectal cancer. GSTM1 and NAT2 were generally not associated with rectal tumor alterations; however, we observed an interaction of ETS and NAT2 in TP53-mutated tumors (p < 0.01). Our investigation shows active smoking is associated with increased risk of TP53, BRAF and MSI+ in rectal tumors and is suggestive of increased risk of CIMP+ tumors. ETS may increase risk of KRAS2 mutations; association with TP53 mutations and ETS may be influenced by NAT2.",1
19353646,"In an effort to discover genes important for human development, we have ascertained patients with congenital anomalies and cytogenetically balanced chromosomal rearrangements. Herein, we report a 4-year-old girl with profound deafness, a history of feeding difficulties, dysmorphism, strabismus, developmental delay, and an apparently balanced de novo paracentric chromosome 5 inversion, inv(5)(q15q33.2). Molecular cytogenetic analysis of the inversion revealed the presence of microdeletions of approximately 400-500 kb at or near both breakpoints. The 5q15 microdeletion completely removes the nuclear receptor NR2F1 (COUP-TFI) from the inverted chromosome 5. We propose haploinsufficiency of NR2F1 to be the cause of the patient's deafness and many of the other associated anomalies based on striking similarity with the Nr2f1 null mouse. Additionally, this study further highlights the need for high resolution analysis of clinical samples with chromosomal rearrangements as associated deletions may be primarily responsible for the clinical features of these patients.",1
19349582,"Centrin has been shown to be involved in centrosome biogenesis in a variety of eukaryotes. In this study, we characterize hPOC5, a conserved centrin-binding protein that contains Sfi1p-like repeats. hPOC5 is localized, like centrin, in the distal portion of human centrioles. hPOC5 recruitment to procentrioles occurs during G2/M, a process that continues up to the full maturation of the centriole during the next cell cycle and is correlated with hyperphosphorylation of the protein. In the absence of hPOC5, RPE1 cells arrest in G1 phase, whereas HeLa cells show an extended S phase followed by cell death. We show that hPOC5 is not required for the initiation of procentriole assembly but is essential for building the distal half of centrioles. Interestingly, the hPOC5 family reveals an evolutionary divergence between vertebrates and organisms like Drosophila melanogaster or Caenorhabditis elegans, in which the loss of hPOC5 may correlate with the conspicuous differences in centriolar structure.",0
19340428,"Several prognostic factors can predict the rapid progression in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), including IGHV mutational status, cytogenetic abnormalities and, more recently, LPL/ADAM29 expression. In contrast, few studies have been devoted to the influence of these factors on clinical outcome in responding patients after therapy. We here propose to analyse the impact of IGHV gene status, LPL and ADAM29 gene expression on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in 41 stage B or C CLL patients in remission after oral fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide. The median follow-up was of 64 (16-74) months. Sequencing of IGHV showed mutated (M) VH genes in 16 of 41 cases and unmutated (UM) in 25 cases. Analysis of LPL and ADAM29 expression in 35 of 41 cases showed overexpression of ADAM29 in 17 cases (14 M and three UM) and LPL in 18 cases (all UM). Patients expressing UM IGHV and LPL had shorter DFS and OS when compared to patients expressing M IGHV and/or ADAM29. Furthermore, blood minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluation using four-colour flow cytometry was performed in 33 out the 41 patients. We showed that patients who achieved phenotypic remission displayed longer DFS than those with MRD(+). Our results support the use of LPL and ADAM29 gene expression associated to IGHV mutational status for predicting the clinical outcome of patients treated by oral fludarabine + cyclophosphamide and could be considered for treatment strategies.",1
19340305,"Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is the etiologic agent for cervical cancer. Yet, infection with HPV is not sufficient to cause cervical cancer, because most infected women develop transient epithelial dysplasias that spontaneously regress. Progression to invasive cancer has been attributed to diverse host factors such as immune or hormonal status, as no recurrent genetic alterations have been identified in cervical cancers. Thus, the pressing question as to the biological basis of cervical cancer progression has remained unresolved, hampering the development of novel therapies and prognostic tests. Here we show that at least 20% of cervical cancers harbor somatically-acquired mutations in the LKB1 tumor suppressor. Approximately one-half of tumors with mutations harbored single nucleotide substitutions or microdeletions identifiable by exon sequencing, while the other half harbored larger monoallelic or biallelic deletions detectable by multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA). Biallelic mutations were identified in most cervical cancer cell lines; HeLa, the first human cell line, harbors a homozygous 25 kb deletion that occurred in vivo. LKB1 inactivation in primary tumors was associated with accelerated disease progression. Median survival was only 13 months for patients with LKB1-deficient tumors, but >100 months for patients with LKB1-wild type tumors (P = 0.015, log rank test; hazard ratio = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.083 to 0.77). LKB1 is thus a major cervical tumor suppressor, demonstrating that acquired genetic alterations drive progression of HPV-induced dysplasias to invasive, lethal cancers. Furthermore, LKB1 status can be exploited clinically to predict disease recurrence.",1

19301348,"After criticizing existing systems of health measurement for their unargued commitment to evaluating health states in terms of preferences or well-being, this essay argues that public rather than private values of health states should help guide the allocation of health-related resources. Private evaluation of health states is relative to a prior individual choice of specific activities and goals, while public evaluation is relative to the whole range of important activities and goals. Public evaluation is concerned with securing a wide range of choices as well as with success given one's choice. A reasonable simplification from the public perspective is to focus on just two features of health states: the subjective feelings attached to health states and the limitations that health states imply on the range of important activities that individuals can pursue. Focusing on just these two dimensions permits the construction of a parsimonious classification of health states with regard to what matters most from the public perspective. This classification, which resembles those in the HALex and the Rosser and Kind Disability and Distress Index, might best be built on top of existing health-state classifications, by mapping the health states they define to activity-limitation/feeling pairs. To assign values to these pairs, I propose relying on deliberative groups to make comparisons among the pairs with respect to the relation 'is a more serious limitation on the range of objectives and good lives available to members of the population'. A ranking according to this property, is not a preference ranking, because it is not a ranking in terms of everything that matters to individuals. Working back from the weights attached to the activity-limitation/feeling pairs, one can impute weights for the health states in other classification systems that were mapped to those pairs. If those weights coincide roughly with current weights, then one legitimizes current weights and provides a vehicle for their public discussion and possible revision. If those weights do not coincide, then one has both an argument for revising current views of the cost effectiveness of treatments and policies and a method to carry out such a revision.",0
19299493,"The human motor neuron degenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) is caused by loss of function mutations of immunoglobulin mu-binding protein 2 (IGHMBP2), a protein of unknown function that contains DNA/RNA helicase and nucleic acid-binding domains. Reduced IGHMBP2 protein levels in neuromuscular degeneration (nmd) mice, the mouse model of SMARD1, lead to motor neuron degeneration. We report the biochemical characterization of IGHMBP2 and the isolation of a modifier locus that rescues the phenotype and motor neuron degeneration of nmd mice. We find that a 166 kb BAC transgene derived from CAST/EiJ mice and containing tRNA genes and activator of basal transcription 1 (Abt1), a protein-coding gene that is required for ribosome biogenesis, contains the genetic modifier responsible for motor neuron rescue. Our biochemical investigations show that IGHMBP2 associates physically with tRNAs and in particular with tRNA(Tyr), which are present in the modifier and with the ABT1 protein. We find that transcription factor IIIC-220 kDa (TFIIIC220), an essential factor required for tRNA transcription, and the helicases Reptin and Pontin, which function in transcription and in ribosome biogenesis, are also part of IGHMBP2-containing complexes. Our findings strongly suggest that IGHMBP2 is a component of the translational machinery and that these components can be manipulated genetically to suppress motor neuron degeneration.",1
19282985,"For females, menarche is a most significant physiological event. Age at menarche (AAM) is a trait with high genetic determination and is associated with major complex diseases in women. However, specific genes for AAM variation are largely unknown. To identify genetic factors underlying AAM variation, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) examining about 380,000 SNPs was conducted in 477 Caucasian women. A follow-up replication study was performed to validate our major GWAS findings using two independent Caucasian cohorts with 854 siblings and 762 unrelated subjects, respectively, and one Chinese cohort of 1,387 unrelated subjects--all females. Our GWAS identified a novel gene, SPOCK (Sparc/Osteonectin, CWCV, and Kazal-like domains proteoglycan), which had seven SNPs associated with AAM with genome-wide false discovery rate (FDR) q<0.05. Six most significant SNPs of the gene were selected for validation in three independent replication cohorts. All of the six SNPs were replicated in at least one cohort. In particular, SNPs rs13357391 and rs1859345 were replicated both within and across different ethnic groups in all three cohorts, with p values of 5.09 x 10(-3) and 4.37 x 10(-3), respectively, in the Chinese cohort and combined p values (obtained by Fisher's method) of 5.19 x 10(-5) and 1.02 x 10(-4), respectively, in all three replication cohorts. Interestingly, SPOCK can inhibit activation of MMP-2 (matrix metalloproteinase-2), a key factor promoting endometrial menstrual breakdown and onset of menstrual bleeding. Our findings, together with the functional relevance, strongly supported that the SPOCK gene underlies variation of AAM.",1
19269008,"Deregulation of apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of cancer, and inactivation of cancer cell apoptosis has been reported in many cancers. Caspases, the main executioners during apoptosis and inflammation, have been reported to harbor inactivating mutations in several cancers. The aim of this study was to explore whether CASP1 to 10 and 14 genes that encode caspase 1 to 10 and 14 are somatically mutated in gastrointestinal stromal tumor. We analyzed the entire coding region and all splice sites of all 11 human CASP genes for the detection of somatic mutations in 22 gastrointestinal stromal tumors by a single strand conformation polymorphism assay. We found a recurrent CASP4 mutation (c.1093C>G [p.L365V]) in 4 gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but there were no mutations in the other 10 CASPs. The CASP4 mutation was a missense mutation and was predicted to substitute amino acids in the small protease subunit of caspase 4. Overall, the gastrointestinal stromal tumor tissues harbored a CASP mutation in 18.2% (4/22). Our data indicate that somatic mutation of the CASP4 gene is common in gastrointestinal stromal tumor and suggest a possibility that CASP4 mutation might lead to alteration of apoptotic or inflammatory function and contribute to the pathogenesis of some gastrointestinal stromal tumors.",1
19268274,"Low lean body mass (LBM) is related to a series of health problems, such as osteoporotic fracture and sarcopenia. Here we report a genome-wide association (GWA) study on LBM variation, by using Affymetrix 500K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. In the GWA scan, we tested 379,319 eligible SNPs in 1,000 unrelated US whites and found that two SNPs, rs16892496 (p = 7.55 x 10(-8)) and rs7832552 (p = 7.58 x 10(-8)), within the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) gene were significantly associated with LBM. Subjects carrying unfavorable genotypes at rs16892496 and rs7832552 had, on average, 2.70 and 2.55 kg lower LBM, respectively, compared to those with alternative genotypes. We replicated the significant associations in three independent samples: (1) 1488 unrelated US whites, (2) 2955 Chinese unrelated subjects, and (3) 593 nuclear families comprising 1972 US whites. Meta-analyses of the GWA scan and the replication studies yielded p values of 5.53 x 10(-9) for rs16892496 and 3.88 x 10(-10) for rs7832552. In addition, we found significant interactions between rs16892496 and polymorphisms of several other genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid and the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor-I axes. Results of this study, together with the functional relevance of TRHR in muscle metabolism, support the TRHR gene as an important gene for LBM variation.",1
19244843,"The existing literature on the development of recombinant DNA technology and genetic engineering tends to focus on Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer's recombinant DNA cloning technology and its commercialization starting in the mid-1970s. Historians of science, however, have pointedly noted that experimental procedures for making recombinant DNA molecules were initially developed by Stanford biochemist Paul Berg and his colleagues, Peter Lobban and A. Dale Kaiser in the early 1970s. This paper, recognizing the uneasy disjuncture between scientific authorship and legal invention in the history of recombinant DNA technology, investigates the development of recombinant DNA technology in its full scientific context. I do so by focusing on Stanford biochemist Berg's research on the genetic regulation of higher organisms. As I hope to demonstrate, Berg's new venture reflected a mass migration of biomedical researchers as they shifted from studying prokaryotic organisms like bacteria to studying eukaryotic organisms like mammalian and human cells. It was out of this boundary crossing from prokaryotic to eukaryotic systems through virus model systems that recombinant DNA technology and other significant new research techniques and agendas emerged. Indeed, in their attempt to reconstitute 'life' as a research technology, Stanford biochemists' recombinant DNA research recast genes as a sequence that could be rewritten thorough biochemical operations. The last part of this paper shifts focus from recombinant DNA technology's academic origins to its transformation into a genetic engineering technology by examining the wide range of experimental hybridizations which occurred as techniques and knowledge circulated between Stanford biochemists and the Bay Area's experimentalists. Situating their interchange in a dense research network based at Stanford's biochemistry department, this paper helps to revise the canonized history of genetic engineering's origins that emerged during the patenting of Cohen-Boyer's recombinant DNA cloning procedures.",0
19242412,"Lung disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in CFTR. In cystic fibrosis, chronic infection and dysregulated neutrophilic inflammation lead to progressive airway destruction. The severity of cystic fibrosis lung disease has considerable heritability, independent of CFTR genotype. To identify genetic modifiers, here we performed a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism scan in one cohort of cystic fibrosis patients, replicating top candidates in an independent cohort. This approach identified IFRD1 as a modifier of cystic fibrosis lung disease severity. IFRD1 is a histone-deacetylase-dependent transcriptional co-regulator expressed during terminal neutrophil differentiation. Neutrophils, but not macrophages, from Ifrd1-deficient mice showed blunted effector function, associated with decreased NF-kappaB p65 transactivation. In vivo, IFRD1 deficiency caused delayed bacterial clearance from the airway, but also less inflammation and disease-a phenotype primarily dependent on haematopoietic cell expression, or lack of expression, of IFRD1. In humans, IFRD1 polymorphisms were significantly associated with variation in neutrophil effector function. These data indicate that IFRD1 modulates the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis lung disease through the regulation of neutrophil effector function.",1
19238210,"Deregulation of EGFR signaling is common in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and this finding led to the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that are highly effective in a subset of NSCLC.

Mutations in KRAS (mKRAS) are associated with primary resistance to TKIs.",1
19208769,"Meckel syndrome (MKS) is a ciliopathy characterized by encephalocele, cystic renal disease, liver fibrosis and polydactyly. An identifying feature of MKS1, one of six MKS-associated proteins, is the presence of a B9 domain of unknown function. Using phylogenetic analyses, we show that this domain occurs exclusively within a family of three proteins distributed widely in ciliated organisms. Consistent with a ciliary role, all Caenorhabditis elegans B9-domain-containing proteins, MKS-1 and MKS-1-related proteins 1 and 2 (MKSR-1, MKSR-2), localize to transition zones/basal bodies of sensory cilia. Their subcellular localization is largely co-dependent, pointing to a functional relationship between the proteins. This localization is evolutionarily conserved, because the human orthologues also localize to basal bodies, as well as cilia. As reported for MKS1, disrupting human MKSR1 or MKSR2 causes ciliogenesis defects. By contrast, single, double and triple C. elegans mks/mksr mutants do not display overt defects in ciliary structure, intraflagellar transport or chemosensation. However, we find genetic interactions between all double mks/mksr mutant combinations, manifesting as an increased lifespan phenotype, which is due to abnormal insulin-IGF-I signaling. Our findings therefore demonstrate functional interactions between a novel family of proteins associated with basal bodies or cilia, providing new insights into the molecular etiology of a pleiotropic human disorder.",1
19208129,"A ""bidirectional gene pair"" is defined as two adjacent genes which are located on opposite strands of DNA with transcription start sites (TSSs) not more than 1000 base pairs apart and the intergenic region between two TSSs is commonly designated as a putative ""bidirectional promoter"". Individual examples of bidirectional gene pairs have been reported for years, as well as a few genome-wide analyses have been studied in mammalian and human genomes. However, no genome-wide analysis of bidirectional genes for plants has been done. Furthermore, the exact mechanism of this gene organization is still less understood.",0
19207181,"The congenital heart disease 5 (CHD5)/tryptophan rich basic protein (WRB) is a protein containing a tryptophan-rich carboxy-terminal region, which was discovered in the human fetal heart. In humans, this CHD5/WRB is located between the markers ACTL5-D21S268 within the Down syndrome (DS) Region-2 at chromosome 21. Congenital heart disease is commonly linked to DS patients. The functions of this gene product are unknown. To identify the functions of CHD5/WRB in heart formation during embryogenesis, the medaka CHD5 cDNA (mCHD5) was isolated and its gene expression pattern and the localization of its gene product were investigated. The obtained mCHD5 belongs to the CHD5 superfamily, whose members include coiled-coil proteins. The mCHD5 gene was found to be expressed in the developing heart after stage 28 at which the chamber (ventricle and atrium) differentiation in the heart tube is initiated in the embryo. Its gene product was also detected in the developing heart at embryonic stage 28 and 35. Knocking-down of mCHD5 function caused severe cardiac disorder, including abnormal chamber differentiation, abnormal looping and ocular abnormality such as Cyclops. Our results provide the mCHD5 gene expression pattern as well as its physiological role during heart formation in a vertebrate model system.",1

19194464,"Natural killer (NK)-cell malignancies are among the most aggressive lymphoid neoplasms with very poor prognosis. We performed array comparative genomic hybridization analysis on a number of NK cell lines and primary tumors to gain better understanding of the pathogenesis and tumor biology of these malignancies. We also obtained transcriptional profiles of genes residing in these regions and compared them with normal and activated NK cells. Only 30-50% of the genes residing in the gained or deleted regions showed corresponding increased or decreased expression. However, many of the upregulated genes in regions of gain are functionally important for the proliferation and growth of the neoplastic population. Genes downregulated in regions of loss included many transcription factors or repressors, tumor suppressors or negative regulators of the cell cycle. The minimal common region of deletion in 6q21 included three known genes (PRDM1, ATG5 and AIM1) showing generally low expression. Mutations resulting in truncated PRDM1 and changes in conserved amino-acid sequences of AIM1 were detected. Highly methylated CpG islands 5' of PRDM1 and AIM1 correlated with low expression of the transcripts. Reversal of methylation by Decitabine induced expression of PRDM1 and cell death. In conclusion, we have shown a general tumor-promoting effect of genetic alterations and have identified PRDM1 as the most likely target gene in del6q21. ATG5, an essential gene for autophagy and AIM1, a gene implicated in melanoma, may also participate in the functional abnormalities.",1
19190079,"The serine/threonine kinase B-Raf plays a key role in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway that relays extracellular signals for cell proliferation and survival. Several types of human malignancies harbor activating BRAF mutations, most frequently a V600E substitution. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a transmembrane tyrosine kinase (TK) receptor that mediates proliferation and survival signaling, is expressed in a wide variety of normal and neoplastic tissues. EGFR inhibitors have produced objective responses in patients with non-small cell lung carcinomas harboring activating EGFR TK domain somatic mutations. We evaluated the presence of mutations in BRAF (exons 11 and 15), KRAS (exons 1 and 2), NRAS (exons 1 and 2), and EGFR (exons 18-21) in adrenal carcinomas (35 tumor specimens and two cell lines) by DNA sequencing. BRAF mutations were found in two carcinomas (5.7%). Four carcinomas (11.4%) carried EGFR TK domain mutations. One specimen carried a KRAS mutation, and another carried two NRAS mutations. No mutations were found in the two adrenocortical cell lines. BRAF- and EGFR-mutant tumor specimens exhibited stronger immunostaining for the phosphorylated forms of the MEK and ERK kinases than their wild-type counterparts. EGFR-mutant carcinomas exhibited increased phosphorylation of EGFR (Tyr 992) compared with wild-type carcinomas. We conclude that BRAF, RAS, and EGFR mutations occur in a subset of human adrenocortical carcinomas. Inhibitors of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and EGFR pathways represent candidate targeted therapies for future clinical trials in carefully selected patients with adrenocortical carcinomas harboring respective activating mutations.",1
19185284,"Low plasma levels of carotenoids and tocopherols are associated with increased risk of chronic disease and disability. Because dietary intake of these lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamins is only poorly correlated with plasma levels, we hypothesized that circulating carotenoids (vitamin A-related compounds) and tocopherols (vitamin E-related compounds) are affected by common genetic variation. By conducting a genome-wide association study in a sample of Italians (n = 1190), we identified novel common variants associated with circulating carotenoid levels and known lipid variants associated with alpha-tocopherol levels. Effects were replicated in the Women's Health and Aging Study (n = 615) and in the alpha-Tocopherol, beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) study (n = 2136). In meta-analyses including all three studies, the G allele at rs6564851, near the beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase 1 (BCMO1) gene, was associated with higher beta-carotene (p = 1.6 x 10(-24)) and alpha-carotene (p = 0.0001) levels and lower lycopene (0.003), zeaxanthin (p = 1.3 x 10(-5)), and lutein (p = 7.3 x 10(-15)) levels, with effect sizes ranging from 0.10-0.28 SDs per allele. Interestingly, this genetic variant had no significant effect on plasma retinol (p > 0.05). The SNP rs12272004, in linkage disequilibrium with the S19W variant in the APOA5 gene, was associated with alpha-tocopherol (meta-analysis p = 7.8 x 10(-10)) levels, and this association was substantially weaker when we adjusted for triglyceride levels (p = 0.002).

19178980,"The debate over the role of stochasticity is central in evolutionary biology, often summarised by whether or not evolution is predictable or repeatable. Here we distinguish three types of stochasticity: stochasticity of mutation and variation, of individual life histories and of environmental change. We then explain when stochasticity matters in evolution, distinguishing four broad situations: stochasticity contributes to maladaptation or limits adaptation; it drives evolution on flat fitness landscapes (evolutionary freedom); it might promote jumps from one fitness peak to another (evolutionary revolutions); and it might shape the selection pressures themselves. We show that stochasticity, by directly steering evolution, has become an essential ingredient of evolutionary theory beyond the classical Wright-Fisher or neutralist-selectionist debates.",0
19176640,"Losses of heterozygosity (LOH) of the short arm of chromosome 19 are frequent in lung cancer, suggesting that one or more tumor suppressor genes are present in this region. The LKB1 gene, also called STK11, is somatically inactivated through point mutations and large deletions in lung tumors, demonstrating that LKB1 is a target of the LOH of this chromosomal arm. Data from several independent groups have provided information about the profiles of lung tumors with LKB1 inactivation and it is generally agreed that this alteration strongly predominates in non-small cell lung cancer, in particular adenocarcinomas, in smokers. The LKB1 protein has serine-threonine kinase activity and is involved in the regulation of the cell energetic checkpoint through the phosphorylation and activation of adenosine monophosphate-dependent kinase (AMPK). LKB1 is also involved in other processes such as cell polarization, probably through substrates other than AMPK. Interestingly, another gene on chromosome 19p, BRG1, encoding a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, has emerged as a tumor suppressor gene that is altered in lung tumors. Similar to LKB1, BRG1 is somatically inactivated by point mutations or large deletions in lung tumors featuring LOH of chromosome 19p. These observations suggest an important role for BRG1 in lung cancer and highlight the need to further our understanding of the function of Brahma/SWI2-related gene 1 (BRG1) in cancer. Finally, simultaneous mutations at LKB1 and BRG1 are common in lung cancer cells, which exemplifies how a single event, LOH of chromosome 19p in this instance, targets two different tumor suppressors.",1

Very often the elucidation of the mechanisms of drug-drug interactions in man is impossible; therefore, for clinical pharmacologists experiments on animals remain the tool in order to gain more knowledge in this field.",0
19117981,"To search for genetic variants that are associated with prostate cancer risk in the genome, we combined the data from our genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a population-based case-control study in Sweden with publicly available GWAS data from the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) study. We limited the cases to those with aggressive disease in an attempt to identify risk variants that are associated with this most clinically relevant form of the disease. Among the most likely candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) identified from the two GWAS, we sequentially confirmed one SNP at 22q13 in two independent study populations: the remaining subjects in Cancer of the Prostate in Sweden and a hospital-based case-control study at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Association of aggressive prostate cancer with the SNP at 22q13 was also observed in the publicly available data of four additional study populations from the second stage of the CGEMS study. In all seven study populations examined, the frequency of allele ""C"" of rs9623117 at 22q13 was consistently higher in aggressive cases than in controls. The combined allelic test was highly significant, with P = 5.0 x 10(-7). The odds ratio (OR) of allele C for aggressive prostate cancer was estimated to be 1.18 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.11-1.26]. However, the SNP was also associated with nonaggressive prostate cancer, with an estimated OR of 1.11 (95% CI, 1.04-1.19; P = 0.004). The risk-associated variants are located within the genomic region of TNRC6B, a gene involved in miRNA-mediated mRNA degradation. Additional studies are warranted to further confirm the association.",1
19114657,"Hypertension places a major burden on individual and public health, but the genetic basis of this complex disorder is poorly understood. We conducted a genome-wide association study of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) in Amish subjects and found strong association signals with common variants in a serine/threonine kinase gene, STK39. We confirmed this association in an independent Amish and 4 non-Amish Caucasian samples including the Diabetes Genetics Initiative, Framingham Heart Study, GenNet, and Hutterites (meta-analysis combining all studies: n = 7,125, P < 10(-6)). The higher BP-associated alleles have frequencies > 0.09 and were associated with increases of 3.3/1.3 mm Hg in SBP/DBP, respectively, in the Amish subjects and with smaller but consistent effects across the non-Amish studies. Cell-based functional studies showed that STK39 interacts with WNK kinases and cation-chloride cotransporters, mutations in which cause monogenic forms of BP dysregulation. We demonstrate that in vivo, STK39 is expressed in the distal nephron, where it may interact with these proteins. Although none of the associated SNPs alter protein structure, we identified and experimentally confirmed a highly conserved intronic element with allele-specific in vitro transcription activity as a functional candidate for this association. Thus, variants in STK39 may influence BP by increasing STK39 expression and consequently altering renal Na(+) excretion, thus unifying rare and common BP-regulating alleles in the same physiological pathway.",1

Although they are not suitable for genetic studies, other approaches are successfully used to unravel mechanisms and molecules involved in cell fate specification and morphogenesis. Microinjection is the elective method to study gene function in sea urchin embryos. It is used to deliver precise amounts of DNA, RNA, oligonucleotides, peptides, or antibodies into the eggs or even into blastomeres. Here we describe microinjection as it is currently applied in our laboratory and show how it has been used in gene perturbation analyses and dissection of cis-regulatory DNA elements.",0

18989701,"The MECP2 gene on Xq28 encodes a transcriptional repressor, which binds to and modulates expression of active genes. Mutations in MECP2 cause classic or preserved speech variant Rett syndrome and intellectual disability in females and early demise or marked neurodevelopmental handicap in males. The consequences of a hypomorphic Mecp2 allele were recently investigated in a mouse model, which developed obesity, motor, social, learning, and behavioral deficits, predicting a human neurobehavioral syndrome. Here, we describe mutation analysis of a nondysmorphic female proband and her father who presented with primarily neuropsychiatric manifestations and obesity with relative sparing of intelligence, language, growth, and gross motor skills. We identified and characterized a novel missense mutation (c.454C>G; p.P152A) in the critical methyl-binding domain of MeCP2 that disrupts MeCP2 functional activity. We show that a gradient of impairment is present when the p.P152A mutation is compared with an allelic p.P152R mutation, which causes classic Rett syndrome and another Rett syndrome-causing mutation, such that protein-heterochromatin binding observed by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting is wild-type > P152A > P152R > T158 M, consistent with the severity of the observed phenotype. Our findings provide evidence for very mild phenotypes in humans associated with partial reduction of MeCP2 function arising from subtle variation in MECP2.",1

18952825,"Genes for height have gained interest for decades, but only recently have candidate genes started to be identified. We have performed linkage analysis and genome-wide association for height in approximately 4000 individuals from five European populations. A total of five chromosomal regions showed suggestive linkage and in one of these regions, two SNPs (rs849140 and rs1635852) were associated with height (nominal P = 7.0 x 10(-8) and P = 9.6 x 10(-7), respectively). In total, five SNPs across the genome showed an association with height that reached the threshold of genome-wide significance (nominal P < 1.6 x 10(-7)). The association with height was replicated for two SNPs (rs1635852 and rs849140) using three independent studies (n = 31 077, n=1268 and n = 5746) with overall meta P-values of 9.4 x 10(-10) and 5.3 x 10(-8). These SNPs are located in the JAZF1 gene, which has recently been associated with type II diabetes, prostate and endometrial cancer. JAZF1 is a transcriptional repressor of NR2C2, which results in low IGF1 serum concentrations, perinatal and early postnatal hypoglycemia and growth retardation when knocked out in mice. Both the linkage and association analyses independently identified the JAZF1 region affecting human height. We have demonstrated, through replication in additional independent populations, the consistency of the effect of the JAZF1 SNPs on height. Since this gene also has a key function in the metabolism of growth, JAZF1 represents one of the strongest candidates influencing human height identified so far.",1

18844977,"The local connectivity and global position of a protein in a protein interaction network are known to correlate with some of its functional properties, including its essentiality or dispensability. It is therefore of interest to extend this observation and examine whether network properties of two proteins considered simultaneously can determine their joint dispensability, i.e., their propensity for synthetic sick/lethal interaction. Accordingly, we examine the predictive power of protein interaction networks for synthetic genetic interaction in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an organism in which high confidence protein interaction networks are available and synthetic sick/lethal gene pairs have been extensively identified.",0
18803769,"The homeobox genes are a large and diverse group of genes, many of which play important roles in the embryonic development of animals. Comparative study of homeobox genes, both within and between species, requires an evolutionary-based classification. HomeoDB was designed and implemented as a manually curated database to collect and present homeobox genes in an evolutionarily structured way, allowing genes, gene families and gene classes to be compared between species more readily than was possible previously. In its first release, HomeoDB includes all homeobox genes from human, amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae) and fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster); additional species can be added.

18798525,"Despite decades of research, morphogenesis along the various body axes remains one of the major mysteries in developmental biology. A milestone in the field was the realisation that a set of closely related regulators, called Hox genes, specifies the identity of body segments along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis in most animals. Hox genes have been highly conserved throughout metazoan evolution and code for homeodomain-containing transcription factors. Thus, they exert their function mainly through activation or repression of downstream genes. However, while much is known about Hox gene structure and molecular function, only a few target genes have been identified and studied in detail. Our knowledge of Hox downstream genes is therefore far from complete and consequently Hox-controlled morphogenesis is still poorly understood. Genome-wide approaches have facilitated the identification of large numbers of Hox downstream genes both in Drosophila and vertebrates, and represent a crucial step towards a comprehensive understanding of how Hox proteins drive morphological diversification. In this review, we focus on the role of Hox genes in shaping segmental morphologies along the AP axis in Drosophila, discuss some of the conclusions drawn from analyses of large target gene sets and highlight methods that could be used to gain a more thorough understanding of Hox molecular function. In addition, the mechanisms of Hox target gene regulation are considered with special emphasis on recent findings and their implications for Hox protein specificity in the context of the whole organism.",1
18776929,"Osteoporosis, the most prevalent metabolic bone disease among older people, increases risk for low trauma hip fractures (HF) that are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Hip bone size (BS) has been identified as one of the key measurable risk factors for HF. Although hip BS is highly genetically determined, genetic factors underlying the trait are still poorly defined. Here, we performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of hip BS interrogating approximately 380,000 SNPs on the Affymetrix platform in 1,000 homogeneous unrelated Caucasian subjects, including 501 females and 499 males. We identified a gene, PLCL1 (phospholipase c-like 1), that had four SNPs associated with hip BS at, or approaching, a genome-wide significance level in our female subjects; the most significant SNP, rs7595412, achieved a p value of 3.72x10(-7). The gene's importance to hip BS was replicated using the Illumina genotyping platform in an independent UK cohort containing 1,216 Caucasian females. Two SNPs of the PLCL1 gene, rs892515 and rs9789480, surrounded by the four SNPs identified in our GWAS, achieved p values of 8.62x10(-3) and 2.44x10(-3), respectively, for association with hip BS. Imputation analyses on our GWAS and the UK samples further confirmed the replication signals; eight SNPs of the gene achieved combined imputed p values<10(-5) in the two samples. The PLCL1 gene's relevance to HF was also observed in a Chinese sample containing 403 females, including 266 with HF and 177 control subjects. A SNP of the PLCL1 gene, rs3771362 that is only approximately 0.6 kb apart from the most significant SNP detected in our GWAS (rs7595412), achieved a p value of 7.66x10(-3) (odds ratio = 0.26) for association with HF. Additional biological support for the role of PLCL1 in BS comes from previous demonstrations that the PLCL1 protein inhibits IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate)-mediated calcium signaling, an important pathway regulating mechanical sensing of bone cells. Our findings suggest that PLCL1 is a novel gene associated with variation in hip BS, and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of HF.",1

18691054,"Human contains 49 ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes and the multidrug resistance associated proteins (MRP1/ABCC1, MRP2/ABCC2, MRP3/ABCC3, MRP4/ABCC4, MRP5/ABCC5, MRP6/ABCC6, MRP7/ABCC10, MRP8/ABCC11 and MRP9/ABCC12) belong to the ABCC family which contains 13 members. ABCC7 is cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; ABCC8 and ABCC9 are the sulfonylurea receptors which constitute the ATP-sensing subunits of a complex potassium channel. MRP10/ABCC13 is clearly a pseudo-gene which encodes a truncated protein that is highly expressed in fetal human liver with the highest similarity to MRP2/ABCC2 but without transporting activity. These transporters are localized to the apical and/or basolateral membrane of the hepatocytes, enterocytes, renal proximal tubule cells and endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier. MRP/ABCC members transport a structurally diverse array of important endogenous substances and xenobiotics and their metabolites (in particular conjugates) with different substrate specificity and transport kinetics. The human MRP/ABCC transporters except MRP9/ABCC12 are all able to transport organic anions, such as drugs conjugated to glutathione, sulphate or glucuronate. In addition, selected MRP/ABCC members may transport a variety of endogenous compounds, such as leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4) by MRP1/ABCC1), bilirubin glucuronides (MRP2/ABCC2, and MRP3/ABCC3), prostaglandins E1 and E2 (MRP4/ABCC4), cGMP (MRP4/ABCC4, MRP5/ABCC5, and MRP8/ABCC11), and several glucuronosyl-, or sulfatidyl steroids. In vitro, the MRP/ABCC transporters can collectively confer resistance to natural product anticancer drugs and their conjugated metabolites, platinum compounds, folate antimetabolites, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs, arsenical and antimonial oxyanions, peptide-based agents, and in concert with alterations in phase II conjugating or biosynthetic enzymes, classical alkylating agents, alkylating agents. Several MRP/ABCC members (MRPs 1-3) are associated with tumor resistance which is often caused by an increased efflux and decreased intracellular accumulation of natural product anticancer drugs and other anticancer agents. Drug targeting of these transporters to overcome MRP/ABCC-mediated multidrug resistance may play a role in cancer chemotherapy. Most MRP/ABCC transporters are subject to inhibition by a variety of compounds. Based on currently available preclinical and limited clinical data, it can be expected that modulation of MRP members may represent a useful approach in the management of anticancer and antimicrobial drug resistance and possibly of inflammatory diseases and other diseases. A better understanding of their substrates and inhibitors has important implications in development of drugs for treatment of cancer and inflammation.",1
18676451,"The Gene Ontology (GO) is extensively used to analyze all types of high-throughput experiments. However, researchers still face several challenges when using GO and other functional annotation databases. One problem is the large number of multiple hypotheses that are being tested for each study. In addition, categories often overlap with both direct parents/descendents and other distant categories in the hierarchical structure. This makes it hard to determine if the identified significant categories represent different functional outcomes or rather a redundant view of the same biological processes. To overcome these problems we developed a generative probabilistic model which identifies a (small) subset of categories that, together, explain the selected gene set. Our model accommodates noise and errors in the selected gene set and GO. Using controlled GO data our method correctly recovered most of the selected categories, leading to dramatic improvements over current methods for GO analysis. When used with microarray expression data and ChIP-chip data from yeast and human our method was able to correctly identify both general and specific enriched categories which were overlooked by other methods.",0

In the group of diabetic patients is good to prevent the combinations of drugs, which can lead to drug-drug interactions and use alternative therapy with lower potential of drug-drug interactions. In this paper we present the possibilities of clinical pharmacist from the Department of clinical pharmacology to prevent and solve the drug-drug interactions in diabetic patients.",1

The most frequent errors done by medical specialists in the usage of the Latin anatomical terminology are emphasized and the situation of eponyms in contemporary anatomy is discussed in detail as well. The last version of the nomenclature makes its way very slowly in the professional community and it is necessary to refer to positive changes and advantages it has brought.

The authors of the article strongly recommend using the recent revision of the Latin anatomical nomenclature both in the oral and written forms, when educating and publishing.",0
18619555,"Ceramidases catalyze hydrolysis of ceramides to generate sphingosine (SPH), which is phosphorylated to form sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Ceramide, SPH, and S1P are bioactive lipids that mediate cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, adhesion, and migration. Presently, 5 human ceramidases encoded by 5 distinct genes have been cloned: acid ceramidase (AC), neutral ceramidase (NC), alkaline ceramidase 1 (ACER1), alkaline ceramidase 2 (ACER2), and alkaline ceramidase 3 (ACER3). Each human ceramidase has a mouse counterpart. AC, NC, and ACER1-3 have maximal activities in acidic, neutral, and alkaline environments, respectively. ACER1-3 have similar protein sequences but no homology to AC and NC. AC and NC also have distinct protein sequences. The human AC (hAC) was implicated in Farber disease, and hAC may be important for cell survival. The mouse AC (mAC) is needed for early embryo survival. NC is protective against inflammatory cytokines, and the mouse NC (mNC) is required for the catabolism of ceramides in the digestive tract. ACER1 is critical in mediating cell differentiation by controlling the generation of SPH and S1P and that ACER2's role in cell proliferation and survival depends on its expression or the cell type in which it is found. Here, we discuss the role of each ceramidase in regulating cellular responses mediated by ceramides, SPH, and S1P.",1
18614020,"The brain produces two brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) transcripts, with either short or long 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs). The physiological significance of the two forms of mRNAs encoding the same protein is unknown. Here, we show that the short and long 3' UTR BDNF mRNAs are involved in different cellular functions. The short 3' UTR mRNAs are restricted to somata, whereas the long 3' UTR mRNAs are also localized in dendrites. In a mouse mutant where the long 3' UTR is truncated, dendritic targeting of BDNF mRNAs is impaired. There is little BDNF in hippocampal dendrites despite normal levels of total BDNF protein. This mutant exhibits deficits in pruning and enlargement of dendritic spines, as well as selective impairment in long-term potentiation in dendrites, but not somata, of hippocampal neurons. These results provide insights into local and dendritic actions of BDNF and reveal a mechanism for differential regulation of subcellular functions of proteins.",1
18606989,"The transcriptome is a set of genes transcribed in a given tissue under specific conditions and can be characterized by a list of genes with their corresponding frequencies of transcription. Transcriptome changes can be measured by counting gene tags from mRNA libraries or by measuring light signals in DNA microarrays. In any case, it is difficult to completely comprehend the global changes that occur in the transcriptome, given that thousands of gene expression measurements are involved. We propose an approach to define and estimate the diversity and specialization of transcriptomes and gene specificity. We define transcriptome diversity as the Shannon entropy of its frequency distribution. Gene specificity is defined as the mutual information between the tissues and the corresponding transcript, allowing detection of either housekeeping or highly specific genes and clarifying the meaning of these concepts in the literature. Tissue specialization is measured by average gene specificity. We introduce the formulae using a simple example and show their application in two datasets of gene expression in human tissues. Visualization of the positions of transcriptomes in a system of diversity and specialization coordinates makes it possible to understand at a glance their interrelations, summarizing in a powerful way which transcriptomes are richer in diversity of expressed genes, or which are relatively more specialized. The framework presented enlightens the relation among transcriptomes, allowing a better understanding of their changes through the development of the organism or in response to environmental stimuli.",0

18583979,"In an effort to pinpoint potential genetic risk factors for schizophrenia, research groups worldwide have published over 1,000 genetic association studies with largely inconsistent results. To facilitate the interpretation of these findings, we have created a regularly updated online database of all published genetic association studies for schizophrenia ('SzGene'). For all polymorphisms having genotype data available in at least four independent case-control samples, we systematically carried out random-effects meta-analyses using allelic contrasts. Across 118 meta-analyses, a total of 24 genetic variants in 16 different genes (APOE, COMT, DAO, DRD1, DRD2, DRD4, DTNBP1, GABRB2, GRIN2B, HP, IL1B, MTHFR, PLXNA2, SLC6A4, TP53 and TPH1) showed nominally significant effects with average summary odds ratios of approximately 1.23. Seven of these variants had not been previously meta-analyzed. According to recently proposed criteria for the assessment of cumulative evidence in genetic association studies, four of the significant results can be characterized as showing 'strong' epidemiological credibility. Our project represents the first comprehensive online resource for systematically synthesized and graded evidence of genetic association studies in schizophrenia. As such, it could serve as a model for field synopses of genetic associations in other common and genetically complex disorders.",1
18544607,"The Gene Ontology (GO) vocabulary has been extensively explored to analyze the functions of coexpressed genes. However, despite its extended use in Biology and Medical Sciences, there are still high levels of uncertainty about which ontology (i.e. Molecular Process, Cellular Component or Molecular Function) should be used, and at which level of specificity. Moreover, the GO database can contain incomplete information resulting from human annotations, or highly influenced by the available knowledge about a specific branch in an ontology. In spite of these drawbacks, there is a trend to ignore these problems and even use GO terms to conduct searches of gene expression profiles (i.e. expression + GO) instead of more cautious approaches that just consider them as an independent source of validation (i.e. expression versus GO). Consequently, propagating the uncertainty and producing biased analysis of the required gene grouping hypotheses. We proposed a web tool, Onto-CC, as an automatic method specially suited for independent explanation/validation of gene grouping hypotheses (e.g. coexpressed genes) based on GO clusters (i.e. expression versus GO). Onto-CC approach reduces the uncertainty of the queries by identifying optimal conceptual clusters that combine terms from different ontologies simultaneously, as well as terms defined at different levels of specificity in the GO hierarchy. To do so, we implemented the EMO-CC methodology to find clusters in structural databases [GO Directed acyclic Graph (DAG) tree], inspired on Conceptual Clustering algorithms. This approach allows the management of optimal cluster sets as potential parallel hypotheses, guided by multiobjective/multimodal optimization techniques. Therefore, we can generate alternative and, still, optimal explanations of queries that can provide new insights for a given problem. Onto-CC has been successfully used to test different medical and biological hypotheses including the explanation and prediction of gene expression profiles resulting from the host response to injuries in the inflammatory problem. Onto-CC provides two versions: Ready2GO, a precalculated EMO-CC for several genomes and an Advanced Onto-CC for custom annotation files (http://gps-tools2.wustl.edu/onto-cc/index.html).",0
18521090,"A whole genome association study was performed in a phase 3 clinical trial conducted to evaluate a novel antipsychotic, iloperidone, administered to treat patients with schizophrenia. Genotypes of 407 patients were analyzed for 334,563 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SNPs associated with iloperidone efficacy were identified within the neuronal PAS domain protein 3 gene (NPAS3), close to a translocation breakpoint site previously observed in a family with schizophrenia. Five other loci were identified that include the XK, Kell blood group complex subunit-related family, member 4 gene (XKR4), the tenascin-R gene (TNR), the glutamate receptor, inotropic, AMPA 4 gene (GRIA4), the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor-alpha2 gene (GFRA2), and the NUDT9P1 pseudogene located in the chromosomal region of the serotonin receptor 7 gene (HTR7).

18514160,"Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) controls thyroid growth and hormone secretion through binding to its G protein-coupled receptor (TSHR) and production of cyclic AMP (cAMP). Serum TSH is a sensitive indicator of thyroid function, and overt abnormalities in thyroid function lead to common endocrine disorders affecting approximately 10% of individuals over a life span. By genotyping 362,129 SNPs in 4,300 Sardinians, we identified a strong association (p = 1.3 x 10(-11)) between alleles of rs4704397 and circulating TSH levels; each additional copy of the minor A allele was associated with an increase of 0.13 muIU/ml in TSH. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is located in intron 1 of PDE8B, encoding a high-affinity cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase. The association was replicated in 4,158 individuals, including additional Sardinians and two genetically distant cohorts from Tuscany and the Old Order Amish (overall p value = 1.9 x 10(-20)). In addition to association of TSH levels with SNPs in PDE8B, our genome scan provided evidence for association with PDE10A and several biologically interesting candidates in a focused analysis of 24 genes. In particular, we found evidence for association of TSH levels with SNPs in the THRB (rs1505287, p = 7.3 x 10(-5)), GNAQ (rs10512065, p = 2.0 x 10(-4)), TG (rs2252696, p = 2.2 x 10(-3)), POU1F1 (rs1976324, p = 3.9 x 10(-3)), PDE4D (rs27178, p = 8.3 x 10(-3)), and TSHR (rs4903957, p = 8.6 x 10(-3)) loci. Overall, the results suggest a primary effect of PDE8B variants on cAMP levels in the thyroid. This would affect production of T4 and T3 and feedback to alter TSH release by the pituitary. PDE8B may thus provide a candidate target for the treatment of thyroid dysfunction.",1

18493797,"Split-hand/foot malformation (SHFM) associated with aplasia of long bones, SHFLD syndrome or Tibial hemimelia-ectrodactyly syndrome is a rare condition with autosomal dominant inheritance, reduced penetrance and an incidence estimated to be about 1 in 1,000,000 liveborns. To date, three chromosomal regions have been reported as strong candidates for harboring SHFLD syndrome genes: 1q42.2-q43, 6q14.1 and 2q14.2. We characterized the phenotype of nine affected individuals from a large family with the aim of mapping the causative gene. Among the nine affected patients, four had only SHFM of the hands and no tibial defects, three had both defects and two had only unilateral tibial hemimelia. In keeping with previous publications of this and other families, there was clear evidence of both variable expression and incomplete penetrance, the latter bearing hallmarks of anticipation. Segregation analysis and multipoint Lod scores calculations (maximum Lod score of 5.03 using the LINKMAP software) using all potentially informative family members, both affected and unaffected, identified the chromosomal region 17p13.1-17p13.3 as the best and only candidate for harboring a novel mutated gene responsible for the syndrome in this family.

18457927,"A crucial pre-requisite for large-scale annotation of eukaryotic genomes is the definition of what constitutes a gene. This issue is addressed here in the light of novel and surprising gene features that have recently emerged from large-scale genomic and transcriptomic analyses. The updated operational definition proposed here is: ""a gene is a discrete genomic region whose transcription is regulated by one or more promoters and distal regulatory elements and which contains the information for the synthesis of functional proteins or non-coding RNAs, related by the sharing of a portion of genetic information at the level of the ultimate products (proteins or RNAs)"". This definition is specifically designed for eukaryotic chromosomal genes and emphasizes the commonality of the genetic material that gives rise to final, functional products (ncRNAs or proteins) derived from a single gene. It may be useful in several applications and should help in the provision of a comprehensive inventory of the genes of a given organism, finally allowing answers to the basic question of ""how many genes"" are encoded in its genome.",0
18451265,"Several studies have shown that healthy individuals with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels at the high end of the normal range have an increased risk of mortality. To identify genetic determinants that contribute to interindividual variation in FPG, we tested 392,935 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 654 normoglycemic participants for association with FPG, and we replicated the most strongly associated SNP (rs560887, P = 4 x 10(-7)) in 9353 participants. SNP rs560887 maps to intron 3 of the G6PC2 gene, which encodes glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (also known as IGRP), a protein selectively expressed in pancreatic islets. This SNP was associated with FPG (linear regression coefficient beta = -0.06 millimoles per liter per A allele, combined P = 4 x 10(-23)) and with pancreatic beta cell function (Homa-B model, combined P = 3 x 10(-13)) in three populations; however, it was not associated with type 2 diabetes risk. We speculate that G6PC2 regulates FPG by modulating the set point for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells.",1
18445632,"Functional genomics technologies have been widely adopted in the biological research of both model and non-model species. An efficient functional annotation of DNA or protein sequences is a major requirement for the successful application of these approaches as functional information on gene products is often the key to the interpretation of experimental results. Therefore, there is an increasing need for bioinformatics resources which are able to cope with large amount of sequence data, produce valuable annotation results and are easily accessible to laboratories where functional genomics projects are being undertaken. We present the Blast2GO suite as an integrated and biologist-oriented solution for the high-throughput and automatic functional annotation of DNA or protein sequences based on the Gene Ontology vocabulary. The most outstanding Blast2GO features are: (i) the combination of various annotation strategies and tools controlling type and intensity of annotation, (ii) the numerous graphical features such as the interactive GO-graph visualization for gene-set function profiling or descriptive charts, (iii) the general sequence management features and (iv) high-throughput capabilities. We used the Blast2GO framework to carry out a detailed analysis of annotation behaviour through homology transfer and its impact in functional genomics research. Our aim is to offer biologists useful information to take into account when addressing the task of functionally characterizing their sequence data.",0
18439552,"Data from the Pharmacogenomics and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease (PARC) study and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) provide independent and confirmatory evidence for association between common polymorphisms of the HNF1A gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha and plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration. Analyses with the use of imputation-based methods to combine genotype data from both studies and to test untyped SNPs from the HapMap database identified several SNPs within a 5 kb region of HNF1A intron 1 with the strongest evidence of association with CRP phenotype.",1
18430022,"Homeobox genes play a critical role in regulating various aspects of plant growth and development. In the present study, we identified a total of 107 homeobox genes in the rice genome and grouped them into ten distinct subfamilies based upon their domain composition and phylogenetic analysis. A significantly large number of homeobox genes are located in the duplicated segments of the rice genome, which suggests that the expansion of homeobox gene family, in large part, might have occurred due to segmental duplications in rice. Furthermore, microarray analysis was performed to elucidate the expression profiles of these genes in different tissues and during various stages of vegetative and reproductive development. Several genes with predominant expression during various stages of panicle and seed development were identified. At least 37 homeobox genes were found to be differentially expressed significantly (more than two-fold; P < 0.05) under various abiotic stress conditions. The results of the study suggest a critical role of homeobox genes in reproductive development and abiotic stress signaling in rice, and will facilitate the selection of candidate genes of agronomic importance for functional validation.",1
18425390,"To better understand the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis induced in uterine endometrium by therapeutic anti-estrogenic Tamoxifen (TAM) exposure, 27 uterine tumors (4 benign endometrial polyps and 23 carcinomas) associated with TAM exposure were analyzed for the presence and spectrum of p53 and K-ras mutations. Although there was no significant difference between TAM-associated endometrial carcinomas and sporadic endometrial tumors in the frequency of these mutations, the spectrum of p53 mutations was characteristically unique to the TAM-associated tumors. The median duration of TAM exposure was significantly longer in patients with p53 mutations than those without p53 mutations (62 vs. 30 months, p=0.028). Our observation suggests that prolonged TAM exposure may directly inactivate the p53 gene by acting as a mutagen in a significant fraction of TAM-associated endometrial carcinomas.",1
18424452,"The main clinical features of two siblings from a consanguineous marriage were progressive myoclonic epilepsy without intellectual impairment and a nephrotic syndrome with a strong accumulation of C1q in capillary loops and mesangium of kidney. The biochemical analysis of one of the patients revealed a normal beta-glucocerebrosidase activity in leukocytes, but a severe enzymatic deficiency in cultured skin fibroblasts. This deficiency suggested a defect in the intracellular sorting pathway of this enzyme. The sequence analysis of the gene encoding LIMP-2 (SCARB2), the sorting receptor for beta-glucocerebrosidase, confirmed this hypothesis. A homozygous nonsense mutation in codon 178 of SCARB2 was found in the patient, whereas her healthy parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Besides lacking immunodetectable LIMP-2, patient fibroblasts also had decreased amounts of beta-glucocerebrosidase, which was mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum, as assessed by its sensitivity to Endo H. This is the first report of a mutation in the SCARB2 gene associated with a human disease, which, contrary to earlier proposals, shares no features with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease both at the clinical and neurophysiological levels.",1
18418104,"Pediatric obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. Significant obesity-related comorbidities are being noted at earlier ages and often have implications for the acute and critically ill child. This article will review the latest in epidemiologic trends of pediatric obesity and examine how it affects multisystem body organs.

Available nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic, and surgical strategies to combat pediatric obesity will be discussed.",1
18414507,"Heterozygous mutations in the LMX1B gene cause nail patella syndrome (NPS) that is associated with nail and skeletal malformations, nephropathy, and glaucoma. Previous phenotype studies of Lmx1b null mice revealed dorsal limb and renal anomalies similar to human NPS, which contributed to the identification of heterozygous mutations in this LIM-homeodomain protein LMX1B as the genetic defect responsible for NPS. Despite advanced insight into the role of the Lmx1b transcription factor in a broad range of animal developmental programs, the pathogenic mechanism underlying dominant inheritance of NPS in man remained unclear. Here, we describe for the first time the detection of two entire LMX1B gene deletions and one smaller exonic LMX1B deletion by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in a series of eight unrelated families with classical features of NPS in whom no pathogenic LMX1B mutation was found by sequence analysis. The identification of entire LMX1B deletions strongly confirms that haploinsufficiency is the principal pathogenetic mechanism of NPS and suggests a difference in dosage sensitivity for this gene between mice and man.",1
18411254,"Roberts syndrome/SC phocomelia (RBS) is an autosomal recessive disorder with growth retardation, craniofacial abnormalities and limb reduction. Cellular alterations in RBS include lack of cohesion at the heterochromatic regions around centromeres and the long arm of the Y chromosome, reduced growth capacity, and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents. RBS is caused by mutations in ESCO2, which encodes a protein belonging to the highly conserved Eco1/Ctf7 family of acetyltransferases that is involved in regulating sister chromatid cohesion. We identified 10 new mutations expanding the number to 26 known ESCO2 mutations. We observed that these mutations result in complete or partial loss of the acetyltransferase domain except for the only missense mutation that occurs in this domain (c.1615T>G, W539G). To investigate the mechanism underlying RBS, we analyzed ESCO2 mutations for their effect on enzymatic activity and cellular phenotype. We found that ESCO2 W539G results in loss of autoacetyltransferase activity. The cellular phenotype produced by this mutation causes cohesion defects, proliferation capacity reduction and mitomycin C sensitivity equivalent to those produced by frameshift and nonsense mutations associated with decreased levels of mRNA and absence of protein. We found decreased proliferation capacity in RBS cell lines associated with cell death, but not with increased cell cycle duration, which could be a factor in the development of phocomelia and cleft palate in RBS. In summary, we provide the first evidence that loss of acetyltransferase activity contributes to the pathogenesis of RBS, underscoring the essential role of the enzymatic activity of the Eco1p family of proteins.",1
18400035,"Terminal or interstitial deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5 is associated with a genetic disorder, cri-du-chat syndrome (cat cry syndrome), which is characterized by a cat-like cry in infancy, facial dysmorphism, microcephaly, and mental retardation. There is a high degree of variation in clinical presentations of patients with cri-du-chat syndrome, which is usually associated with different sizes and locations of deletions in chromosome 5p. Most patients with a 5p deletion have de novo mutations; familial 5p deletion is rare in literature. Here, we report a three-generation family with a 5p terminal deletion. The terminal 5p deletion (5p15.2-pter) in this family was confirmed and characterized by karyotyping analysis, fluorescent in situ hybridization, array comparative genome hybridization, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Although the affected family members apparently share deletions of the same size, there are some variations in mental symptoms within this family. Two affected females manifest moderate mental retardation and psychotic symptoms such as delusion of persecution, auditory hallucination, self-talking, and self-laughing, which are rare in cri-du-chat syndrome. In contrast, the other three affected males express mild-to-moderate mental retardation but no psychotic symptoms. Our study suggests that other factors besides the size and location of 5p deletions may modify the mental presentations of patients with 5p deletions.",1
18392983,"Essential genes are the genes that are indispensable for the survival of an organism. The genome-scale identification of essential genes has been performed in various organisms, and we consequently constructed DEG, a Database that contains currently available essential genes. Here we analyzed functional distributions of essential genes in DEG, and found that some essential-gene functions are even conserved between the prokaryote (bacteria) and the eukaryote (yeast), e.g., genes involved in information storage and processing are overrepresented, whereas those involved in metabolism are underrepresented in essential genes compared with non-essential ones. In bacteria, species specificity in functional distribution of essential genes is mainly due to those involved in cellular processes. Furthermore, within the category of information storage and processing, function of translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis are predominant in essential genes. Finally, some potential pitfalls for analyzing gene essentiality based on DEG are discussed.",0
18392979,"As transposomics is extended to genome scale, appropriate statistical methods need to be developed to assign significance to gene essentiality.

18384288,"The analysis of sports samples for prohibited substances began in the 1960s and has developed since then using modern technologies close to the latest scientific discoveries. In this chapter the latest techniques and applications are described as well as the role of the World Anti-Doping Agency as the controlling body for the implementation of these tests. For small molecules, apart from the routine use of GC-MS, the newer techniques include the use of isotope ratio MS to detect testosterone and nandrolone administration and LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-tandem MS) to detect diuretics. For large molecules, several applications of LC-MS/MS are described as well as immunoprocedures for erythropoietin and human growth hormone. Finally, the latest method to detect homologous blood transfusion is briefly described.",0
18364390,"Psoriasis is an immune-mediated skin disorder that is inherited as a multifactorial trait. Linkage studies have clearly identified a primary disease susceptibility locus lying within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), but have generated conflicting results for other genomic regions. To overcome this difficulty, we have carried out a genome-wide association scan, where we analyzed more than 408,000 SNPs in an initial sample of 318 cases and 288 controls. Outside of the MHC, we observed a single cluster of disease-associated markers, spanning 47 kb on chromosome 20q13. The analysis of two replication data sets confirmed this association, with SNP rs495337 yielding a combined P-value of 1.4 x 10(-8) in an overall sample of 2679 cases and 2215 controls. Rs495337 maps to the SPATA2 transcript and is in absolute linkage disequilibrium with five SNPs lying in the adjacent ZNF313 gene (also known as RNF114). Real-time PCR experiments showed that, unlike SPATA2, ZNF313 is abundantly expressed in skin, T-lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Furthermore, an analysis of the expression data available from the Genevar database indicated that rs495337 is associated with increased ZNF313 transcripts levels (P = 0.003), suggesting that the disease susceptibility allele may be a ZNF313 regulatory variant tagged by rs495337. Homology searches indicated that ZNF313 is a paralogue of TRAC-1, an ubiquitin ligase regulating T-cell activation. We performed cell-free assays and confirmed that like TRAC-1, ZNF313 binds ubiquitin via an ubiquitin-interaction motif (UIM). These findings collectively identify a novel psoriasis susceptibility gene, with a putative role in the regulation of immune responses.",1
18355772,"Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 confer high risks of breast cancer. However, evidence suggests that these risks are modified by other genetic or environmental factors that cluster in families. A recent genome-wide association study has shown that common alleles at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FGFR2 (rs2981582), TNRC9 (rs3803662), and MAP3K1 (rs889312) are associated with increased breast cancer risks in the general population. To investigate whether these loci are also associated with breast cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, we genotyped these SNPs in a sample of 10,358 mutation carriers from 23 studies. The minor alleles of SNP rs2981582 and rs889312 were each associated with increased breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers (per-allele hazard ratio [HR] = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.20-1.45, p(trend) = 1.7 x 10(-8) and HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.02-1.24, p(trend) = 0.02) but not in BRCA1 carriers. rs3803662 was associated with increased breast cancer risk in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers (per-allele HR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.06-1.20, p(trend) = 5 x 10(-5) in BRCA1 and BRCA2 combined). These loci appear to interact multiplicatively on breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers. The differences in the effects of the FGFR2 and MAP3K1 SNPs between BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers point to differences in the biology of BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer tumors and confirm the distinct nature of breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers.",1
18336209,"Reversely transfected cell microarrays (RTCM) have been introduced as a method for parallel high throughput analysis of gene functions in mammalian cells. Hundreds to thousands of different recombinant DNA or RNA molecules can be transfected into different cell clusters at the same time on a single glass slide with this method. This allows either the simultaneous overexpression or--by using the recently developed RNA interference (RNAi) techniques--knockdown of a huge number of target genes. A growing number of sophisticated detection systems have been established to determine quantitatively the effects of the transfected molecules on the cell phenotype. Several different cell types have been successfully used for this procedure. This review summarizes the presently available knowledge on this technique and provides a laboratory protocol.",0
18335320,"The discursive explosion that was provoked by the new genetics could support the impression that the ethical and social problems posed by the new genetics are somehow exceptional in their very nature. According to this view we are faced with special ethical and social problems that create a challenge so fundamental that the special label of genethics is needless to justify. The historical account regarding the evolution of the gene concepts could serve us to highlight the limits of what we know about genes and what we can do with genes. The widespread notion about the exceptionality of genetic knowledge and its applicative possibilities is hardly justifiable and leads to misunderstandings regarding the conceptualization of the ethical and social problems we might face. Following a more realistic interpretation of the role of genes in human life we might avoid a whole set of fictive dilemmas and counterproductive regulatory efforts in bioethics. Bioethical discourse should move from the gene-centered scientific discourse toward the more sophisticated and complex discourses where human development represented as a matter of complex interactions between genomes and environments, between genes, educational factors, nutritional regimes, and other different developmental resources. If a gene is seen as one among the different developmental resources that are shaping a given human trait then both genethics and genetic exceptionalism could hardly be represented as a justified approach in discussing the ethical and social problems of genetics.",0
18334489,"While genome sequencing efforts reveal the basic building blocks of life, a genome sequence alone is insufficient for elucidating biological function. Genome annotation--the process of identifying genes and assigning function to each gene in a genome sequence--provides the means to elucidate biological function from sequence. Current state-of-the-art high-throughput genome annotation uses a combination of comparative (sequence similarity data) and non-comparative (ab initio gene prediction algorithms) methods to identify protein-coding genes in genome sequences. Because approaches used to validate the presence of predicted protein-coding genes are typically based on expressed RNA sequences, they cannot independently and unequivocally determine whether a predicted protein-coding gene is translated into a protein. With the ability to directly measure peptides arising from expressed proteins, high-throughput liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics approaches can be used to verify coding regions of a genomic sequence. Here, we highlight several ways in which high-throughput tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics can improve the quality of genome annotations and suggest that it could be efficiently applied during the gene calling process so that the improvements are propagated through the subsequent functional annotation process.",0
18325910,"Obesity is a major public health problem with strong genetic determination; however, the genetic factors underlying obesity are largely unknown. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association scan for obesity by examining approximately 500 000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a sample of 1000 unrelated US Caucasians. We identified a novel gene, CTNNBL1, which has multiple SNPs associated with body mass index (BMI) and fat mass. The most significant SNP, rs6013029, achieved experiment-wise P-values of 2.69 x 10(-7) for BMI and of 4.99 x 10(-8) for fat mass, respectively. The SNP rs6013029 minor allele T confers an average increase in BMI and fat mass of 2.67 kg/m(2) and 5.96 kg, respectively, compared with the alternative allele G. We further genotyped the five most significant CTNNBL1 SNPs in a French case-control sample comprising 896 class III obese adults (BMI > or = 40 kg/m(2)) and 2916 lean adults (BMI < 25 kg/m(2)). All five SNPs showed consistent associations with obesity (8.83 x 10(-3) < P < 6.96 x 10(-4)). Those subjects who were homozygous for the rs6013029 T allele had 1.42-fold increased odds of obesity compared with those without the T allele. The protein structure of CTNNBL1 is homologous to beta-catenin, a family of proteins containing armadillo repeats, suggesting similar biological functions. beta-Catenin is involved in the Wnt/beta-catenin-signaling pathway which appears to contribute to maintaining the undifferentiated state of pre-adipocytes by inhibiting adipogenic gene expression. Our study hence suggests a novel mechanism for the development of obesity, where CTNNBL1 may play an important role. Our study also provided supportive evidence for previously identified associations between obesity and INSIG2 and PFKP, but not FTO.",1
18325051,"To compare the potential of two diagnostic methods for detecting recurrence of urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) of the bladder, by (i) detecting alterations in microsatellite DNA markers and loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and (ii) detecting aberrant gene hypermethylation, as UCC has a high recurrence rate in the urinary tract and the disease can invade muscle if new tumours are overlooked.",0
18311069,"The purpose of this study was to assess the bitterness intensity and pH of the solutions of clarithromycin dry syrup (CAM-DS), carbocisteine preparation (CC), and the concomitant use of both drugs. We conducted 6 types of human gustatory sensation tests with 6 healthy male volunteers. As a result, there was almost no difference in the bitterness intensity of CAM-DS between the branded (the latest and former preparations) and the generic formulations. The bitterness intensity of CAM-DS (the latest and former preparations of the branded as well as the generic formulations) was almost equally enhanced by mixing it with either the branded CC-DS or the branded and the generic carbocisteine granule (CC-Gr). On this occasion, the enhancing the bitterness of the branded CAM-DS (latest and former preparation) was nearly avoided safely by dosage form's changing CC-DS or CC-Gr to the branded CC-Sy. However, unlike the branded CC-Sy, some generic CC-Sy failed to suppress the bitterness. Furthermore, it was proven that some generic CAM-DS were shown to exhibit bitterness when mixed with even branded CC-Sy. In conclusion, it should be noted that the extent of bitterness of the mixture of CAM-DS and CC highly varies among the generic formulations.",0
18292807,"In humans, hereditary inactivation of either p22(phox) or gp91(phox) leads to chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a severe immune disorder characterized by the inability of phagocytes to produce bacteria-destroying ROS. Heterodimers of p22(phox) and gp91(phox) proteins constitute the superoxide-producing cytochrome core of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. In this study, we identified the nmf333 mouse strain as what we believe to be the first animal model of p22(phox) deficiency. Characterization of nmf333 mice revealed that deletion of p22(phox) inactivated not only the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, but also a second cytochrome in the inner ear epithelium. As a consequence, mice of the nmf333 strain exhibit a compound phenotype consisting of both a CGD-like immune defect and a balance disorder caused by the aberrant development of gravity-sensing organs. Thus, in addition to identifying a model of p22(phox)-dependent immune deficiency, our study indicates that a clinically identifiable patient population with an otherwise cryptic loss of gravity-sensor function may exist. Thus, p22(phox) represents a shared and essential component of at least 2 superoxide-producing cytochromes with entirely different biological functions. The site of p22(phox) expression in the inner ear leads us to propose what we believe to be a novel mechanism for the control of vestibular organogenesis.",1
18282277,"Aberrant Wnt-signaling caused by mutants of beta-catenin, a key regulator of the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway, is frequently detected in cancer. Only recently, it was suggested that in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) the expression of the target gene glutamine synthetase (GS) is a highly reliable marker for the identification of beta-catenin mutations. In order to prove this hypothesis, 52 samples from human hepatocellular carcinomas were analysed for the activation of beta-catenin and the expression of GS. In total, 45 samples stained positive for cytoplasmic/nuclear beta-catenin. A strong correlation between expression of GS and activated beta-catenin (100% of nuclear and 84% of cytosolic) was found. However, among 35 GS positive tumors that were analysed for beta-catenin mutations no mutations were detected in 25 GS-positive carcinomas although 24 out of the 25 carcinomas exhibited at least abnormal expression of beta-catenin. Since the mutational analysis identified 9 different point mutations of the beta-catenin gene including the rare mutation H36P and the yet unknown mutation P44A it was asked whether these mutations may differently effect beta-catenin target genes. Therefore, expression plasmids for different mutations were constructed and cotransfected with the TOP-flash luciferase reporter and a reporter carrying the GS-5'-enhancer. The experiments confirmed that there are differences between different beta-catenin target sequences and different beta-catenin mutations. In addition, the failure that the endogenous expression of GS in GS-negative cells was not induced by the transient transfection experiment indicated that the effect of beta-catenin on the GS-5'-enhancer is only one aspect of gene activation induced by beta-catenin.",1
18282107,"Sex differences in schizophrenia are well known, but their genetic basis has not been identified. We performed a genome-wide association scan for schizophrenia in an Ashkenazi Jewish population using DNA pooling. We found a female-specific association with rs7341475, a SNP in the fourth intron of the reelin (RELN) gene (p = 2.9 x 10(-5) in women), with a significant gene-sex effect (p = 1.8 x 10(-4)). We studied rs7341475 in four additional populations, totaling 2,274 cases and 4,401 controls. A significant effect was observed only in women, replicating the initial result (p = 2.1 x 10(-3) in women; p = 4.2 x 10(-3) for gene-sex interaction). Based on all populations the estimated relative risk of women carrying the common genotype is 1.58 (p = 8.8 x 10(-7); p = 1.6 x 10(-5) for gene-sex interaction). The female-specific association between RELN and schizophrenia is one of the few examples of a replicated sex-specific genetic association in any disease.",1
18264097,"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer affecting males in developed countries. It shows consistent evidence of familial aggregation, but the causes of this aggregation are mostly unknown. To identify common alleles associated with prostate cancer risk, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using blood DNA samples from 1,854 individuals with clinically detected prostate cancer diagnosed at </=60 years or with a family history of disease, and 1,894 population-screened controls with a low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration (<0.5 ng/ml). We analyzed these samples for 541,129 SNPs using the Illumina Infinium platform. Initial putative associations were confirmed using a further 3,268 cases and 3,366 controls. We identified seven loci associated with prostate cancer on chromosomes 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 19 and X (P = 2.7 x 10(-8) to P = 8.7 x 10(-29)). We confirmed previous reports of common loci associated with prostate cancer at 8q24 and 17q. Moreover, we found that three of the newly identified loci contain candidate susceptibility genes: MSMB, LMTK2 and KLK3.",1
18260141,"We report on two unrelated families where the probands presented with learning difficulties and a microduplication 22q11.2. In the first family the proband was a 7-year-old boy who was referred because of psychomotor retardation, behavioral problems, large weight and height, and mild dysmorphism. His father and one brother also had mental retardation and behavioral anomalies, and presented the same microduplication. In the second family only the proband had mild learning difficulties, but the same microduplication 22q11.2 was discovered in her sister, her asymptomatic mother and grandfather. No distinctly recognizable phenotype has been observed in the individuals from our two families diagnosed with microduplication 22q11.2. The marked clinical variability both inter- and intrafamilial, including the presence of a complete normal phenotype and the presence of high intellectual possibilities in two individuals with this microduplication 22q11.2 is remarkable. So far, 63 patients, corresponding to 35 families, with microduplication 22q11.2 have been described. The fact that microduplication 22q11.2 can be seen in individuals with a normal/near normal phenotype has been previously reported as well. We postulate that the clinical findings described so far could be due to ascertainment bias, since the most common reason for performing FISH 22 analyses is to exclude microdeletion. Future reports are needed to answer the question whether microduplication could be a non-pathogenic polymorphism or whether it is a real syndrome with a very large clinical variability and reduced penetrance.",1
18260125,"Current treatment protocols for Wilms tumor achieve 90% cure rates, but relapse risk and side effects from therapy remain challenging. Over the last decade, numerous markers have been proposed for classification and/or prediction of outcome. However, cohort sizes were quite variable and often small. We now provide a large-scale reassessment by real-time RT-PCR of 40 markers in 102 Wilms tumors followed by validation of potentially relevant markers in an independent set of 74 tumors. In the first data set, individual comparison with clinical data combined with adjustment for multiple testing and multivariate analysis revealed potentially relevant alteration of CA9, DKK1, EGR1, HEY2, MYC, MYCN, TERT, TOP2A, TRIM22, and VEGF expression in association with CTNNB1 mutation status, histological risk, response to chemotherapy, metastasis, relapse, or mortality. To further validate these data, potentially relevant genes for specific outcomes were reanalyzed in a second, independent tumor set. Here, univariate analysis confirmed the association of HEY2 with high-risk tumors and of TRIM22 with mortality. Even where significance levels could not be reached, the direction and extent of differential expression were generally reproducible. Multivariate analysis verified a weak correlation of TOP2A expression with metastasis and of TRIM22 with fatal outcome. Although we could corroborate only some of the previously reported associations of expression changes with clinical parameters, our results indicate that real-time RT-PCR analysis can facilitate further classification of Wilms tumor and prediction of outcome to adjust treatment accordingly.

18252221,"Human iris color was one of the first traits for which Mendelian segregation was established. To date, the genetics of iris color is still not fully understood and is of interest, particularly in view of forensic applications. In three independent genome-wide association (GWA) studies of a total of 1406 persons and a genome-wide linkage study of 1292 relatives, all from the Netherlands, we found that the 15q13.1 region is the predominant region involved in human iris color. There were no other regions showing consistent genome-wide evidence for association and linkage to iris color. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HERC2 gene and, to a lesser extent, in the neighboring OCA2 gene were independently associated to iris color variation. OCA2 has been implicated in iris color previously. A replication study within two populations confirmed that the HERC2 gene is a new and significant determinant of human iris color variation, in addition to OCA2. Furthermore, HERC2 rs916977 showed a clinal allele distribution across 23 European populations, which was significantly correlated to iris color variation. We suggest that genetic variants regulating expression of the OCA2 gene exist in the HERC2 gene or, alternatively, within the 11.7 kb of sequence between OCA2 and HERC2, and that most iris color variation in Europeans is explained by those two genes. Testing markers in the HERC2-OCA2 region may be useful in forensic applications to predict eye color phenotypes of unknown persons of European genetic origin.",1
18245380,"Vaccinia virus is the prototypic orthopoxvirus and was the vaccine used to eradicate smallpox, yet the expression profiles of many of its genes remain unknown. Using a genome tiling array approach, we simultaneously measured the expression levels of all 223 annotated vaccinia virus genes during infection and determined their kinetics. For 95% of these genes, significant transcript levels were detected. Most remarkably, classification of the genes by their expression profiles revealed 35 genes exhibiting immediate-early expression. Although a similar kinetic class has been described for other virus families, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of its existence in orthopoxviruses. Despite expression levels higher than for genes in the other three kinetic classes, the functions of more than half of these remain unknown. Additionally, genes within each kinetic class were spatially grouped together in the genome. This genome-wide picture of transcription alters our understanding of how orthopoxviruses regulate gene expression.",0
18239089,"The genome-wide recombination rate varies between individuals, but the mechanism controlling this variation in humans has remained elusive. A genome-wide search identified sequence variants in the 4p16.3 region correlated with recombination rate in both males and females. These variants are located in the RNF212 gene, a putative ortholog of the ZHP-3 gene that is essential for recombinations and chiasma formation in Caenorhabditis elegans. It is noteworthy that the haplotype formed by two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the highest recombination rate in males is associated with a low recombination rate in females. Consequently, if the frequency of the haplotype changes, the average recombination rate will increase for one sex and decrease for the other, but the sex-averaged recombination rate of the population can stay relatively constant.",1

18204447,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypical autoimmune disease characterized by production of autoantibodies and complex genetic inheritance. In a genome-wide scan using 85,042 SNPs, we identified an association between SLE and a nonsynonymous substitution (rs10516487, R61H) in the B-cell scaffold protein with ankyrin repeats gene, BANK1. We replicated the association in four independent case-control sets (combined P = 3.7 x 10(-10); OR = 1.38). We analyzed BANK1 cDNA and found two isoforms, one full-length and the other alternatively spliced and lacking exon 2 (Delta2), encoding a protein without a putative IP3R-binding domain. The transcripts were differentially expressed depending on a branch point-site SNP, rs17266594, in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs10516487. A third associated variant was found in the ankyrin domain (rs3733197, A383T). Our findings implicate BANK1 as a susceptibility gene for SLE, with variants affecting regulatory sites and key functional domains. The disease-associated variants could contribute to sustained B cell-receptor signaling and B-cell hyperactivity characteristic of this disease.",1

18172692,"Opitz BBB/G syndrome (OS) is a heterogenous malformation syndrome mainly characterised by hypertelorism and hypospadias. In addition, patients may present with several other defects of the ventral midline such as cleft lip and palate and congenital heart defects. The syndrome-causing gene encodes the X-linked E3 ubiquitin ligase MID1 that mediates ubiquitin-specific modification and degradation of the catalytic subunit of the translation regulator protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Here, we show that the MID1 protein also associates with elongation factor 1alpha (EF-1alpha) and several other proteins involved in mRNA transport and translation, including RACK1, Annexin A2, Nucleophosmin and proteins of the small ribosomal subunits. Mutant MID1 proteins as found in OS patients lose the ability to interact with EF-1alpha. The composition of the MID1 protein complex was determined by several independent methods: (1) yeast two-hybrid screening and (2) immunofluorescence, (3) a biochemical approach involving affinity purification of the complex, (4) co-fractionation in a microtubule assembly assay and (5) immunoprecipitation. Moreover, we show that the cytoskeleton-bound MID1/translation factor complex specifically associates with G- and U-rich RNAs and incorporates MID1 mRNA, thus forming a microtubule-associated ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Our data suggest a novel function of the OS gene product in directing translational control to the cytoskeleton. The dysfunction of this mechanism would lead to malfunction of microtubule-associated protein translation and to the development of OS.",1

Direct sequencing of exon 4 of the transforming growth factor-beta receptor type II gene, which showed a band shift by single-strand conformation polymorphism, disclosed a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs2228048) (alleles A/G; average allele frequency, G:0.817, A:0.183) and not an active mutation. Seven of the 14 cases showed base substitution (G --> A) of the single nucleotide polymorphism. Two of these 7 cases showed base substitution (G --> A) in the blood sample in accordance with neoplastic transformation. Direct sequencing of exon 2 of the Smad3 gene, which showed band shift by single-strand conformation polymorphism, disclosed single nucleotide polymorphism (rs1065080) (alleles C/T; average allele frequency, C:0.947, T:0.053) and no active mutation. Four of the 14 cases showed base substitution (C --> T) of the single nucleotide polymorphism. Blood samples were available for 2 of these 4 cases, and 1 of these 2 cases showed base substitution (C --> T) in accordance with neoplastic transformation.

18086775,"Discriminant markers are required for accurate cancer screening. We evaluated genes frequently methylated in colorectal neoplasia to identify the most discriminant ones. Four genes specifically methylated in colorectal cancer [bone morphogenetic protein 3 (BMP3), EYA2, aristaless-like homeobox-4 (ALX4), and vimentin] were selected from 41 candidate genes and evaluated on 74 cancers, 62 adenomas, and 70 normal epithelia. Methylation status was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively and confirmed by bisulfite genomic sequencing. Effect of methylation on gene expression was evaluated in five colon cancer cell lines. K-ras and BRAF mutations were detected by sequencing. Methylation of BMP3, EYA2, ALX4, or vimentin was detected respectively in 66%, 66%, 68%, and 72% of cancers; 74%, 48%, 89%, and 84% of adenomas; and 7%, 5%, 11%, and 11% of normal epithelia (P < 0.01, cancer or adenoma versus normal). Based on area under the curve analyses, discrimination was not significantly improved by combining markers. Comethylation was frequent (two genes or more in 72% of cancers and 84% of adenomas), associated with proximal neoplasm site (P < 0.001), and linked with both BRAF and K-ras mutations (P < 0.01). Cell line experiments supported silencing of expression by methylation in all four study genes. This study shows BMP3, EYA2, ALX4, and vimentin genes are methylated in most colorectal neoplasms but rarely in normal epithelia. Comethylation of these genes is common, and pursuit of complementary markers for methylation-negative neoplasms is a rational strategy to optimize screening sensitivity.",1
18075580,"Evolution of the earliest mammals shows successive episodes of diversification. Lineage-splitting in Mesozoic mammals is coupled with many independent evolutionary experiments and ecological specializations. Classic scenarios of mammalian morphological evolution tend to posit an orderly acquisition of key evolutionary innovations leading to adaptive diversification, but newly discovered fossils show that evolution of such key characters as the middle ear and the tribosphenic teeth is far more labile among Mesozoic mammals. Successive diversifications of Mesozoic mammal groups multiplied the opportunities for many dead-end lineages to iteratively evolve developmental homoplasies and convergent ecological specializations, parallel to those in modern mammal groups.",0
18068538,"Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is a benign intraskeletal cyst that often expands rapidly and shows a strong tendency to recur. Rearrangement of chromosome band 17p13 is a characteristic genetic feature of ABC, with t(16;17)(q22;p13) the most frequent chromosomal aberration. This translocation generates a CDH11-USP6 fusion gene in which the strong promoter of osteoblast cadherin 11 gene at 16q22 is fused to the entire ubiquitin-specific protease 6 coding sequence at 17p13. As a result, USP6 (alias Tre2) is transcriptionally upregulated. Fusion genes of several variant translocations have been reported in ABC, including a case with t(17;17) and COL1A1-USP6 fusion. In each translocation, the entire USP6 coding sequence is fused downstream to the promoter region of the partner gene. Here we report a second case of a bone tumor carrying a t(17;17) resulting in a COL1A1-USP6 chimeric gene. As in the previous case, exon 1 of COL1A1 was fused to exon 2 of USP6 in the chimeric transcript. A translation process of the hybrid transcript using the starting ATG codon of the COL1A1 gene results in a truncated, 38 amino acid residues variant of the COL1A1 peptide. Although a pathogenic effect of the small COL1A1 peptide cannot be ruled out, overexpression of USP6 through fusion with the COL1A1 promoter is a more reasonable hypothesis.",1
18059337,"We have previously identified a subgroup of pleomorphic salivary gland adenomas with ring chromosomes of uncertain derivation. Here, we have used spectral karyotyping (SKY), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and high-resolution oligonucleotide array-CGH to determine the origin and content of these rings and to identify genes disrupted as a result of ring formation. Of 16 tumors with rings, 11 were derived from chromosome 8, 3 from chromosome 5 and 1 each from chromosomes 1, 6 and 9. Array-CGH revealed that 10/11 r(8) consisted of amplification of a 19 Mb pericentromeric segment with recurrent breakpoints in FGFR1 in 8p12 and in PLAG1 in 8q12.1. Molecular analyses revealed that ring formation consistently generated novel FGFR1-PLAG1 gene fusions in which the 5'-part of FGFR1 is linked to the coding sequence of PLAG1. An alternative mechanism of PLAG1 activation was found in tumors with copy number gain of an intact PLAG1 gene. Rings derived from chromosomes 1, 5, 6 or 9 did not result in gene fusions, but rather resulted in losses indicative of the involvement of putative tumor suppressor genes on 8p, 5p, 5q and/or 6q. Our findings also reveal a novel mechanism by which FGFR1 contributes to oncogenesis and further illustrate the versatility of the FGFR1 and PLAG1 genes in tumorigenesis.",1

17997608,"High serum uric acid levels elevate pro-inflammatory-state gout crystal arthropathy and place individuals at high risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Genome-wide scans in the genetically isolated Sardinian population identified variants associated with serum uric acid levels as a quantitative trait. They mapped within GLUT9, a Chromosome 4 glucose transporter gene predominantly expressed in liver and kidney. SNP rs6855911 showed the strongest association (p = 1.84 x 10(-16)), along with eight others (p = 7.75 x 10(-16) to 6.05 x 10(-11)). Individuals homozygous for the rare allele of rs6855911 (minor allele frequency = 0.26) had 0.6 mg/dl less uric acid than those homozygous for the common allele; the results were replicated in an unrelated cohort from Tuscany. Our results suggest that polymorphisms in GLUT9 could affect glucose metabolism and uric acid synthesis and/or renal reabsorption, influencing serum uric acid levels over a wide range of values.",1
17975299,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressively disabling impairments in memory, cognition, and non-cognitive behavioural symptoms. Sporadic AD is multifactorial and genetically complex. While several monogenic mutations cause early-onset AD and gene alleles have been suggested as AD susceptibility factors, the only extensively validated susceptibility gene for late-onset AD is the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele. Alleles of the APOE gene do not account for all of the genetic load calculated to be responsible for AD predisposition. Recently, polymorphisms across the neuronal sortilin-related receptor (SORL1) gene were shown to be significantly associated with AD in several cohorts. Here we present the results of our large case-control whole-genome scan at over 500,000 polymorphisms which presents weak evidence for association and potentially narrows the association interval.",1

17935508,"Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS) is an autosomal recessive disorder causing severe defects in the developing central nervous system and other organs. Recently, mutations in the MKS1 gene have been identified as disease causing in individuals of Finnish MKS families. The primary aim of the present study was to assess the frequency of the 'Finnish founder mutation' (29 bp IVS15-7_35) in the MKS1 gene in 20 aborted fetuses with a diagnosis of MKS. The secondary aim was to screen for novel mutations in the coding sequence of the MKS1 gene of MKS fetuses and to obtain genotype-phenotype correlations where possible. Furthermore, we evaluated the carrier rate of a deletion of 29 bp in intron 15 of the MKS1 gene in a German population. To identify and characterize mutations in the MKS1 gene, sequence analyses and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction studies were performed. We could identify the same type of mutation, a deletion of 29 bp in intron 15 of the MKS1 gene, in 8 out of the 20 cases studied. Six out of the eight cases with such a mutation displayed the campomelic variant of MKS. The carrier frequency among 519 healthy German individuals was 1:260. This deletion in the MKS1 gene is highly associated with a distinct subtype of the MKS, namely the campomelic variant. In individuals of European origin suffering from the campomelic MKS variant, the described deletion is highly likely to be causative. Regarding the results of our study, the incidence of MKS in Germany can be estimated as 1:135,000. In families with a known mutation in the MKS1 gene, it is now possible to offer an early prenatal testing, for example with chorionic villus sampling and mutation analysis.",1
17912430,"Although it is well established that ras genes contribute to tumourigenesis either through the accumulation of mutations or by aberrant expression in a wide range of human cancers, little is known regarding their involvement in human nasal polyps (NPs). In the present study, the occurrence of mutations in codons 11 and 12 of the ras family genes was examined by PCR/RFLP and direct sequencing in 23 human NPs and their adjacent turbinates, as well as in turbinates from 13 control subjects. Moreover, the expression pattern of ras mRNA levels was assessed in NP specimens and compared to adjacent and control tissues. K-ras codon 11 and 12 mutations were detected in 17 and 35% of NPs, respectively, and were found in the adjacent inferior turbinate (AIT) (22 and 16%, respectively) and adjacent middle turbinates (AMT) (16 and 26%, respectively). K- and H-ras expression levels were elevated, whereas N-ras mRNA levels were lower in NPs and adjacent turbinates as compared to the control tissues. K-ras mRNA levels were up-regulated in advanced-stage polyps (P=0.037), while N-ras levels were found elevated in small polyps (P=0.046). Statistically significant negative correlations between K- and N-ras expression profiles arose in NPs and AITs (P=0.009 and 0.003, respectively). This, to our knowledge, is the first report on ras mutations and expression analysis in NPs. Our findings suggest a potential key role for activated members of ras family genes in terms of their contribution to the development of NPs as well as to the hypertrophy of adjacent turbinates.",1
17910772,"Adjacent gene pairs in the yeast genome have a tendency to express concurrently. Sharing of regulatory elements within the intergenic region of those adjacent gene pairs was often considered the major mechanism responsible for such co-expression. However, it is still in debate to what extent that common transcription factors (TFs) contribute to the co-expression of adjacent genes. In order to resolve the evolutionary aspect of this issue, we investigated the conservation of adjacent pairs in five yeast species. By using the information for TF binding sites in promoter regions available from the MYBS database http://cg1.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~mybs/, the ratios of TF-sharing pairs among all the adjacent pairs in yeast genomes were analyzed. The levels of co-expression in different adjacent patterns were also compared.",0
17889454,"THADA, mapping to chromosomal band 2p21 is target gene of specific chromosomal rearrangements observed in thyroid benign tumors. Thus, it is one of the most common gene targets in chromosomal rearrangements in benign epithelial tumors. Nevertheless, nothing is known about the function of its protein. Therefore, we have analyzed the genetic structure of THADA homologous genes in selected vertebrates (Canis familiaris, Chlorocebus aethiops, Gallus gallus, and Mus musculus), which are not characterized up to now. The coding sequences of the mRNA of these species have been sequenced and analyzed revealing similarities to ARM repeat structures which indicates an involvement in protein-protein interactions. Using multiple alignments we identified the most conserved part of the protein (aa 1033-1415 Homo sapiens) with an identity of 70.5% between the most different organisms implying a putative important functional domain. The truncations observed in human thyroid adenomas disrupt this conserved domain of the protein indicating a loss of function of THADA contributing to the development of the follicular neoplasias of the thyroid.",1

17847065,"Faciogenital dysplasia or Aarskog-Scott syndrome (AAS) is an X-linked disorder characterized by craniofacial, skeletal, and urogenital malformations and short stature. Mutations in the only known causative gene FGD1 are found in about one-fifth of the cases with the clinical diagnosis of AAS. FGD1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that specifically activates the Rho GTPase Cdc42 via its RhoGEF domain. The Cdc42 pathway is involved in skeletal formation and multiple aspects of neuronal development. We describe a boy with typical AAS and, in addition, unilateral focal polymicrogyria (PMG), a feature hitherto unreported in AAS. Sequencing of the FGD1 gene in the index case and his mother revealed the presence of a novel mutation (1396A>G; M466V), located in the evolutionary conserved alpha-helix 4 of the RhoGEF domain. M466V was not found in healthy family members, in >300 healthy controls and AAS patients, and has not been reported in the literature or mutation databases to date, indicating that this novel missense mutation causes AAS, and possibly PMG. Brain cortex malformations such as PMG could be initiated by mutations in the evolutionary conserved RhoGEF domain of FGD1, by perturbing the signaling via Rho GTPases such as Cdc42 known to cause brain malformation.",1
17810868,"Sea urchin skeletal elements are composed of single crystals of calcite. Unlike their synthetic counterparts, these crystals do not have well-developed cleavage and are consequently much more resistant to fracture. This phenomenon is due in part to the presence of acidic glycoproteins occluded within the crystals. By means of x-ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation, it is shown that the presence of the protein in synthetic calcite only slightly decreases the coherence length but significantly increases the angular spread of perfect domains of the crystals. In biogenic calcite, the coherence length is 1/3 to 1/4 as much as that in synthetic calcite and the angular spread is 20 to 50 times as wide. It is proposed that the presence of macromolecules concentrated at mosaic boundaries that are oblique to deavage planes is responsible for the change in fracture properties. These results may be important in the material sciences, because of the unusual nature of this material, namely, a composite based on the controlled intercalation of macromolecules inside single-crystal lattices.",0

Functionality of a binding site is reflected in conservation of the binding sequence during evolution and in over represented binding in gene groups with coherent biological functions. Functionality is governed by several parameters such as the TF-DNA binding strength, distance of the binding site from the transcription start site (TSS), DNA packing, and more. Understanding how these parameters control functionality of different TFs in different biological contexts is a must for identifying functional TF binding sites and for understanding regulation of transcription.",0
17720887,"Heterozygous mutations in JAGGED1, encoding a single-pass transmembrane ligand for the Notch receptors, cause Alagille syndrome (AGS), a polymalformative disorder affecting the liver, heart, eyes and skeleton and characterized by a peculiar facies. Most of the JAGGED1 mutations generate premature termination codons, and as a result, two pathogenic mechanisms causing AGS have been proposed: haploinsufficiency or a dominant-negative effect of putative truncated proteins. To determine whether missense or protein-truncating mutations in JAGGED1 can lead to the synthesis and function of abnormal proteins, we performed cell culture experiments. We showed that human JAGGED1 undergoes a metalloprotease-dependent cleavage resulting in the shedding of its extracellular domain and that this domain seems able to fulfill a biological function in vitro, probably by antagonizing Notch signaling. Moreover, the soluble form of JAGGED1 was able to compete with the transmembrane ligand. Mutant proteins with missense or nonsense mutations were synthesized and gave rise to a chord-like phenotype and a migration defect when expressed by stably transfected cells. These chord-like structures were similar to the phenotype exhibited by fibroblasts isolated from a fetus with a protein-truncating mutation. Results obtained from Notch signaling inhibition and Notch reporter assays showed that this chord-like phenotype, exhibited by mutant JAGGED1 transfectants, may result from an inhibitory effect on Notch signaling. Altogether, our results favor a dominant-negative mechanism of some JAGGED1 mutations in AGS.",1

SPRED1 is a member of the SPROUTY/SPRED family of proteins that act as negative regulators of RAS->RAF interaction and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. The clinical features of the reported disorder resemble those of neurofibromatosis type 1 and consist of multiple café-au-lait spots, axillary freckling and macrocephaly. Melanocytes from a café-au-lait spot showed, in addition to the germline SPRED1 mutation, an acquired somatic mutation in the wild-type SPRED1 allele, indicating that complete SPRED1 inactivation is needed to generate a café-au-lait spot in this syndrome. This disorder is yet another member of the recently characterized group of phenotypically overlapping syndromes caused by mutations in the genes encoding key components of the RAS-MAPK pathway.

Although recent studies have successfully identified CD-associated genetic variants, these susceptibility loci explain only a fraction of the heritability of the disease. Here, we report on a multi-stage genome-wide scan of 393 German CD cases and 399 controls. Among the 116,161 single-nucleotide polymorphisms tested, an association with the known CD susceptibility gene NOD2, the 5q31 haplotype, and the recently reported CD locus at 5p13.1 was confirmed. In addition, SNP rs1793004 in the gene encoding nel-like 1 precursor (NELL1, chromosome 11p15.1) showed a consistent disease-association in independent German population- and family-based samples (942 cases, 1082 controls, 375 trios). Subsequent fine mapping and replication in an independent sample of 454 French/Canadian CD trios supported the authenticity of the NELL1 association. Further confirmation in a large German ulcerative colitis (UC) sample indicated that NELL1 is a ubiquitous IBD susceptibility locus (combined p<10(-6); OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.30-2.11). The novel 5p13.1 locus was also replicated in the French/Canadian sample and in an independent UK CD patient panel (453 cases, 521 controls, combined p<10(-6) for SNP rs1992660). Several associations were replicated in at least one independent sample, point to an involvement of ITGB6 (upstream), GRM8 (downstream), OR5V1 (downstream), PPP3R2 (downstream), NM_152575 (upstream) and HNF4G (intron).",1

17658951,"The obesity epidemic is responsible for a substantial economic burden in developed countries and is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The disease is the result not only of several environmental risk factors, but also of genetic predisposition. To take advantage of recent advances in gene-mapping technology, we executed a genome-wide association scan to identify genetic variants associated with obesity-related quantitative traits in the genetically isolated population of Sardinia. Initial analysis suggested that several SNPs in the FTO and PFKP genes were associated with increased BMI, hip circumference, and weight. Within the FTO gene, rs9930506 showed the strongest association with BMI (p = 8.6 x10(-7)), hip circumference (p = 3.4 x 10(-8)), and weight (p = 9.1 x 10(-7)). In Sardinia, homozygotes for the rare ""G"" allele of this SNP (minor allele frequency = 0.46) were 1.3 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the common ""A"" allele. Within the PFKP gene, rs6602024 showed very strong association with BMI (p = 4.9 x 10(-6)). Homozygotes for the rare ""A"" allele of this SNP (minor allele frequency = 0.12) were 1.8 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the common ""G"" allele. To replicate our findings, we genotyped these two SNPs in the GenNet study. In European Americans (N = 1,496) and in Hispanic Americans (N = 839), we replicated significant association between rs9930506 in the FTO gene and BMI (p-value for meta-analysis of European American and Hispanic American follow-up samples, p = 0.001), weight (p = 0.001), and hip circumference (p = 0.0005). We did not replicate association between rs6602024 and obesity-related traits in the GenNet sample, although we found that in European Americans, Hispanic Americans, and African Americans, homozygotes for the rare ""A"" allele were, on average, 1.0-3.0 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the more common ""G"" allele. In summary, we have completed a whole genome-association scan for three obesity-related quantitative traits and report that common genetic variants in the FTO gene are associated with substantial changes in BMI, hip circumference, and body weight. These changes could have a significant impact on the risk of obesity-related morbidity in the general population.",1
17656375,"We ascertained three different families affected with oto-dental syndrome, a rare but severe autosomal-dominant craniofacial anomaly. All affected patients had the unique phenotype of grossly enlarged molar teeth (globodontia) segregating with a high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. In addition, ocular coloboma segregated with disease in one family (oculo-oto-dental syndrome). A genome-wide scan was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip10K 2.0 Array. Parametric linkage analysis gave a single LOD score peak of 3.9 identifying linkage to chromosome 11q13. Haplotype analysis revealed three obligatory recombination events defining a 4.8 Mb linked interval between D11S1889 and SNP rs2077955. Higher resolution mapping and Southern blot analysis in each family identified overlapping hemizygous microdeletions. SNP expression analysis and real-time quantitative RT-PCR in patient lymphoblast cell lines excluded a positional effect on the flanking genes ORAOV1, PPFIA1 and CTTN. The smallest 43 kb deletion resulted in the loss of only one gene, FGF3, which was also deleted in all other otodental families. These data suggest that FGF3 haploinsufficiency is likely to be the cause of otodental syndrome. In addition, the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) gene was also deleted in the one family segregating ocular coloboma. Spatiotemporal in situ hybridization in zebrafish embryos established for the first time that fadd is expressed during eye development. We therefore propose that FADD haploinsufficiency is likely to be responsible for ocular coloboma in this family. This study therefore implicates FGF3 and FADD in human craniofacial disease.",1

17632545,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) in children results from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to insufficient production of insulin. A number of genetic determinants of T1D have already been established through candidate gene studies, primarily within the major histocompatibility complex but also within other loci. To identify new genetic factors that increase the risk of T1D, we performed a genome-wide association study in a large paediatric cohort of European descent. In addition to confirming previously identified loci, we found that T1D was significantly associated with variation within a 233-kb linkage disequilibrium block on chromosome 16p13. This region contains KIAA0350, the gene product of which is predicted to be a sugar-binding, C-type lectin. Three common non-coding variants of the gene (rs2903692, rs725613 and rs17673553) in strong linkage disequilibrium reached genome-wide significance for association with T1D. A subsequent transmission disequilibrium test replication study in an independent cohort confirmed the association. These results indicate that KIAA0350 might be involved in the pathogenesis of T1D and demonstrate the utility of the genome-wide association approach in the identification of previously unsuspected genetic determinants of complex traits.",1
17574970,"We report two cases of translocation associated with deletion on derivative chromosomes in atypical myeloproliferative disorder (MPD). In a MPD with t(3;12)(q29;q14), the rearrangement targeted the HMGA2 locus at 12q14 and deleted a region of about 1.5 megabases (Mb) at 3q29. In an MPD with t(9;12)(q13 approximately q21;q22) and JAK2 V617F mutation, array comparative genomic hybridization delineated a deletion of about 3 Mb at 9q13 approximately q21 and a deletion of about 2 Mb at 12q22 containing SOCS2. These results show that close examination of translocations in hematopoietic diseases may reveal associated microdeletions. The role of these deletions is discussed.",1
17569088,"In addition to the pathogenetic CAG repeat expansion other genetic factors play a significant role in determining age at onset (AO) in Huntington disease (HD), e.g. variations in the NR2A and NR2B glutamate receptor subunit genes (GRIN2A, GRIN2B). In order to expand these findings we fine-mapped a larger HD patient panel (n = 250) using densely spaced markers flanking the originally associated SNPs in GRIN2A and GRIN2B. In GRIN2A association fine-mapping based on eight additional SNPs confirmed intron 2 as the region of strongest association. In GRIN2B fine-mapping with seven additional SNPs consolidated C2664T as causal genetic variation. Gender stratification of patients revealed differences in the variability in AO attributable to the CAG repeat number and highly significant differences in the AO association with the C2664T and rs8057394/ rs2650427 variations. Addition of the corresponding genotype variations to the effect of CAG repeat lengths resulted in a significant increase of the R2 values only in females. The sex-specific effect for C2664T is underscored by differences in the genotype and allele frequencies observed for female versus male HD patients (P = 0.01) caused by decreased CC frequency in females. Overall, female HD patients homozygous for the CC genotype tended to have later AO compared to the other two genotypes. Stratification of the results by presumed menopausal status demonstrated that the significant findings were predominantly observed in pre-menopausal patients. We speculate that altered hormone levels herald protective effects of this genotype. Together, GRIN2A and GRIN2B genotype variations explain 7.2% additional variance in AO for HD.",1
17568405,"Mutations in the WFS1 gene have been reported in Wolfram syndrome (WS), an autosomal recessive disorder defined by early onset of diabetes mellitus (DM) and progressive optic atrophy. Because of the low prevalence of this syndrome and the recent identification of the WFS1 gene, few data are available concerning the relationships between clinical and molecular aspects of the disease. Here, we describe 12 patients from 11 families with WS. We report on eight novel (A214fsX285, L293fsX303, P346L, I427S, V503fsX517, R558C, S605fsX711, P838L) and seven previously reported mutations. We also looked for genotype-phenotype correlation both in patients included in this study and 19 additional WS patients that were previously reported. Subsequently, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of five published clinical and molecular studies of WFS1 for genotype-phenotype correlation, combined with our current French patient group for a total of 96 patients. The presence of two inactivating mutations was shown to predispose to an earlier age of onset of both DM and optic atrophy. Moreover, the clinical expression of WS was more complete and occurred earlier in patients harboring no missense mutation.",1
17557300,"Since the first report by our group in 1999, more than 20 unrelated biallelic mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes (MMR) have been identified. In the present report, we describe two novel cases: one carrying compound heterozygous mutations in the MSH6 gene; and the other, compound heterozygous mutations in the PMS2 gene. Interestingly, the inactivation of one PMS2 allele was likely caused by gene conversion. Although gene conversion has been suggested to be a mutation mechanism underlying PMS2 inactivation, this is the first report of its involvement in a pathogenic mutation. The clinical features of biallelic mutation carriers were similar to other previously described patients, with the presence of café-au-lait spots (CALS), early onset of brain tumors, and colorectal neoplasia. Our data provide further evidence of the existence, although rare, of a distinct recessively inherited syndrome on the basis of MMR constitutional inactivation. The identification of this syndrome should be useful for genetic counseling, especially in families with atypical hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) associated with childhood cancers, and for the clinical surveillance of these mutation carriers.",1

17522711,"Schizophrenia is a strongly heritable disorder, and identification of potential candidate genes has accelerated in recent years. Genomewide scans have identified multiple large linkage regions across the genome, with fine-mapping studies and other investigations of biologically plausible targets demonstrating several promising candidate genes of modest effect. The recent introduction of technological platforms for whole-genome association (WGA) studies can provide an opportunity to rapidly identify novel targets, although no WGA studies have been reported in the psychiatric literature to date. We report results of a case-control WGA study in schizophrenia, examining approximately 500 000 markers, which revealed a strong effect (P=3.7 x 10(-7)) of a novel locus (rs4129148) near the CSF2RA (colony stimulating factor, receptor 2 alpha) gene in the pseudoautosomal region. Sequencing of CSF2RA and its neighbor, IL3RA (interleukin 3 receptor alpha) in an independent case-control cohort revealed both common intronic haplotypes and several novel, rare missense variants associated with schizophrenia. The presence of cytokine receptor abnormalities in schizophrenia may help explain prior epidemiologic data relating the risk for this illness to altered rates of autoimmune disorders, prenatal infection and familial leukemia.",1
17498083,"Modern therapy options offer haemophiliacs more and more possibilities for an active participation in sports. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the attitude of these patients towards sports, their participation in school and leisure time sports activities, and differences between juveniles and adults. We investigated 44 children and adolescents (aged from 4 to 16 years) and 27 adults (aged from 18 to 72 years) with haemophilia by means of a questionnaire. 79.6% of the juvenile patients participated always or almost always in school sports, while this percentage was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the former school time of the adults (37%). Sports play an important or very important role in leisure time activities for 75% of the adolescent and 55.5% of the adult haemophiliacs (P < 0.05). Bleeding complications occurred in 17.6% of all patients; there was no correlation with any particular type of sports. There were only slight differences between both groups, regarding their motivation to participate in sports activities. The main reasons involved social aspects and having fun. The results show that the modern therapy of haemophilia probably leads to a more positive attitude towards sports and to a wider spectrum of practised sports. This, however, may be associated with an increasing potential of health risks, which require a high level of sports medical care.",0
17478638,"Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS; OMIM 260400), an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, is caused by mutations in both alleles of the SBDS gene, which encodes a protein of unknown function. Here we report heterozygosity for the 258 + 2 T>C SBDS gene mutation previously identified in SDS patients in 4 of 91 patients with apparently acquired aplastic anemia (AA) but not in 276 ethnically matched controls (Fisher exact test, P < .004). Affected patients were young and had a poor outcome; they had reduced SBDS expression but no evidence of the pancreatic exocrine failure or skeletal abnormalities typical of SDS. Length of telomeres in granulocytes of SBDS heterozygous patients was short for their age, and in SDS patients with both SBDS alleles affected further analyzed, granulocytes' telomeres were even shorter, correlating in length with SBDS expression. Higher heterogeneity in telomere length also was observed in SDS patients. Telomerase activity of SBDS-deficient patients' lymphocytes was comparable with controls, and no physical interaction between SBDS protein and telomerase complex components (TERT or TERC) was established. We propose that heterozygosity for the 258 + 2 T>C SBDS mutation predisposes to AA by accelerating telomere shortening of leukocytes via a telomerase-independent mechanism.",1
17474819,"While the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon allele is a well-established risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), initial genome scans using microsatellite markers in late-onset AD failed to identify this locus on chromosome 19. Recently developed methods for the simultaneous assessment of hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) promise to help more precisely identify loci that contribute to the risk of AD and other common multigenic conditions. We sought here to demonstrate that more precise identification of loci that are associated with complex, multi-genic genetic disorders can be achieved using ultra-high-density whole-genome associations by demonstrating their ability to identify the APOE locus as a major susceptibility gene for late-onset AD, despite the absence of SNPs within the APOE locus itself, as well as to refine odds ratios (ORs) based on gold-standard phenotyping of the study population.",1
17463089,"At least 5% of the human genome predating the mammalian radiation is thought to have evolved under purifying selection, yet protein-coding and related untranslated exons occupy at most 2% of the genome. Thus, the majority of conserved and, by extension, functional sequence in the human genome seems to be nonexonic. Recent work has highlighted a handful of cases where mobile element insertions have resulted in the introduction of novel conserved nonexonic elements. Here, we present a genome-wide survey of 10,402 constrained nonexonic elements in the human genome that have all been deposited by characterized mobile elements. These repeat instances have been under strong purifying selection since at least the boreoeutherian ancestor (100 Mya). They are most often located in gene deserts and show a strong preference for residing closest to genes involved in development and transcription regulation. In particular, constrained nonexonic elements with clear repetitive origins are located near genes involved in cell adhesion, including all characterized cellular members of the reelin-signaling pathway. Overall, we find that mobile elements have contributed at least 5.5% of all constrained nonexonic elements unique to mammals, suggesting that mobile elements may have played a larger role than previously recognized in shaping and specializing the landscape of gene regulation during mammalian evolution.",0

17447842,"To identify novel susceptibility loci for Crohn disease (CD), we undertook a genome-wide association study with more than 300,000 SNPs characterized in 547 patients and 928 controls. We found three chromosome regions that provided evidence of disease association with p-values between 10(-6) and 10(-9). Two of these (IL23R on Chromosome 1 and CARD15 on Chromosome 16) correspond to genes previously reported to be associated with CD. In addition, a 250-kb region of Chromosome 5p13.1 was found to contain multiple markers with strongly suggestive evidence of disease association (including four markers with p < 10(-7)). We replicated the results for 5p13.1 by studying 1,266 additional CD patients, 559 additional controls, and 428 trios. Significant evidence of association (p < 4 x 10(-4)) was found in case/control comparisons with the replication data, while associated alleles were over-transmitted to affected offspring (p < 0.05), thus confirming that the 5p13.1 locus contributes to CD susceptibility. The CD-associated 250-kb region was saturated with 111 SNP markers. Haplotype analysis supports a complex locus architecture with multiple variants contributing to disease susceptibility. The novel 5p13.1 CD locus is contained within a 1.25-Mb gene desert. We present evidence that disease-associated alleles correlate with quantitative expression levels of the prostaglandin receptor EP4, PTGER4, the gene that resides closest to the associated region. Our results identify a major new susceptibility locus for CD, and suggest that genetic variants associated with disease risk at this locus could modulate cis-acting regulatory elements of PTGER4.",1
17443873,"The theory of a chemo-autotrophic origin of life in a volcanic Iron-Sulfur World postulates the emergence of a pioneer organism within a flow of volcanic exhalations. The pioneer organism is characterized by a composite structure with an inorganic substructure and an organic superstructure. Within the surfaces of the inorganic substructure, iron, cobalt, nickel, and other transition-metal centers with sulfido, carbonyl, cyano, and other ligands are catalytically active, and promote the growth of the organic superstructure through carbon fixation, driven by the reducing potential of the volcanic exhalations. This pioneer organism is reproductive by an autocatalytic feedback effect, whereby some organic products serve as ligands for activating the catalytic metal centres whence they arise. This unitary structure-function relationship of the pioneer organism constitutes the 'Anlage' for two major strands of evolution: enzymatization and cellularization, whereby the upward evolution of life by increase of molecular complexity is grounded ultimately in the transition metal-catalyzed, synthetic redox chemistry of the pioneer organism.",0
17440062,"A recent systematic sequence analysis of well-annotated human protein coding genes or consensus coding sequences led to the identification of 189 genes displaying somatic mutations in breast and colorectal cancers. Based on their mutation prevalence, a subset of these genes was identified as cancer candidate (CAN) genes as they could be potentially involved in cancer. We evaluated the mutational profiles of 19 CAN genes in the highly aggressive tumors: glioblastoma, melanoma, and pancreatic carcinoma. Among other changes, we found novel somatic mutations in EPHA3, MLL3, TECTA, FBXW7, and OBSCN, affecting amino acids not previously found to be mutated in human cancers. Interestingly, we also found a germline nucleotide variant of OBSCN that was previously reported as a somatic mutation. Our results identify specific genetic lesions in glioblastoma, melanoma, and pancreatic cancers and indicate that CAN genes and their mutational profiles are tumor specific. Some of the mutated genes, such as the tyrosine kinase EPHA3, are clearly amenable to pharmacologic intervention and could represent novel therapeutic targets for these incurable cancers. We also speculate that similar to other oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, mutations affecting OBSCN could be involved in cancer predisposition.",1

We subsequently identified two de novo heterozygous missense mutations of a conserved amino acid in the basic region of the TCF4 gene in three additional subjects with PHS. These findings demonstrate that TCF4 anomalies are responsible for PHS and provide the first evidence of a human disorder related to class I basic helix-loop-helix transcription-factor defects (also known as ""E proteins""). Moreover, our data may shed new light on the normal processes underlying autonomic nervous system development and maintenance of an appropriate ventilatory neuronal circuitry.",1

17395743,"To identify genetic variants contributing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in type 2 diabetes, we performed a genome-wide analysis of 115,352 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pools of 105 unrelated case subjects with ESRD and 102 unrelated control subjects who have had type 2 diabetes for > or =10 years without macroalbuminuria. Using a sliding window statistic of ranked SNPs, we identified a 200-kb region on 8q24 harboring three SNPs showing substantial differences in allelic frequency between case and control pools. These SNPs were genotyped in individuals comprising each pool, and strong evidence for association was found with rs2720709 (P = 0.000021; odds ratio 2.57 [95% CI 1.66-3.96]), which is located in the plasmacytoma variant translocation gene PVT1. We sequenced all exons, exon-intron boundaries, and the promoter of PVT1 and identified 47 variants, 11 of which represented nonredundant markers with minor allele frequency > or =0.05. We subsequently genotyped these 11 variants and an additional 87 SNPs identified through public databases in 319-kb flanking rs2720709 ( approximately 1 SNP/3.5 kb); 23 markers were associated with ESRD at P < 0.01. The strongest evidence for association was found for rs2648875 (P = 0.0000018; 2.97 [1.90-4.65]), which maps to intron 8 of PVT1. Together, these results suggest that PVT1 may contribute to ESRD susceptibility in diabetes.",1
17374440,"Gastric cancers with and those without high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H) represent distinctive pathways of carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to clarify if expression of p53 related genes involved in angiogenesis is differentially regulated between these cancers. We systematically analyzed the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), and brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1), and we correlated the results with microvessel count (MVC), MSI status, p53 mutations, and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) expression in gastric cancers. Expression of VEGFA in carcinoma cells was immunohistochemically seen in 46% of 200 cases. VEGFA positivity was significantly associated with higher MVC, vascular invasion, lymph node and distant metastasis, and advanced tumor stage. FGF2 positivity was significantly associated with poor differentiation, depth of invasion, and higher MVC. VEGFA and FGF2 positivities and MVC were lower in MSI-H cancers than in MSI-L or MSS cancers. VEGFA expression was associated with both p53 mutations and PTGS2 expression. Methylation of the THBS1 gene was detected in 6 of 11 cancer cell lines and in 44% of 200 cases. THBS1 methylation was significantly associated with distal location, vascular invasion, distant metastasis, MSI-H, wild-type p53, and higher MVC. The prognosis was worst in patients with cancers that were VEGFA-positive and THBS1 methylation-positive. Gastric cancers with MSI-H were characterized by lower MVC, low frequency of VEGFA, FGF2, and PTGS2 overexpression, and high frequency of THBS1 methylation. Our results suggest that gastric cancers with and those without MSI-H represent distinctive pathways of carcinogenesis, including aberrant expression of factors regulating angiogenesis. The difference may be associated with less aggressive phenotype of these cancers with MSI-H and affect future molecular targeted therapeutics.",1
17357070,"The duplication 17p11.2 syndrome, associated with dup(17)(p11.2p11.2), is a recently recognized syndrome of multiple congenital anomalies and mental retardation and is the first predicted reciprocal microduplication syndrome described--the homologous recombination reciprocal of the Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) microdeletion (del(17)(p11.2p11.2)). We previously described seven subjects with dup(17)(p11.2p11.2) and noted their relatively mild phenotype compared with that of individuals with SMS. Here, we molecularly analyzed 28 additional patients, using multiple independent assays, and also report the phenotypic characteristics obtained from extensive multidisciplinary clinical study of a subset of these patients. Whereas the majority of subjects (22 of 35) harbor the homologous recombination reciprocal product of the common SMS microdeletion (~3.7 Mb), 13 subjects (~37%) have nonrecurrent duplications ranging in size from 1.3 to 15.2 Mb. Molecular studies suggest potential mechanistic differences between nonrecurrent duplications and nonrecurrent genomic deletions. Clinical features observed in patients with the common dup(17)(p11.2p11.2) are distinct from those seen with SMS and include infantile hypotonia, failure to thrive, mental retardation, autistic features, sleep apnea, and structural cardiovascular anomalies. We narrow the critical region to a 1.3-Mb genomic interval that contains the dosage-sensitive RAI1 gene. Our results refine the critical region for Potocki-Lupski syndrome, provide information to assist in clinical diagnosis and management, and lend further support for the concept that genomic architecture incites genomic instability.",1
17352912,"Essential genes are identified in duplicated regions of the bacterial chromosome. Transposition of a vector that forms operon fusions into a strain carrying a chromosomal duplication allows insertion of the transposon into essential genes because a second copy of the essential gene is present. When the duplication is allowed to segregate, only the segregant that carries the copy of the intact essential gene survives. The transposon insertion in the essential gene is maintained only in the duplication derivatives. A technique is described that uses a Tn10 derivative, Tn10dTc-araC(+), which contains a cloned copy of the Escherichia coli araC(+) gene, as a portable region of homology to generate large duplications of the Salmonella chromosome. The duplication is maintained in the population by growth in the presence of tetracycline. When the lac operon fusion vector, MudJ, is transposed into the duplicated region, removal of tetracycline from the growth media allows segregation of the duplication yielding (Ara(-)) haploid segregants which appear as red colonies or as red/white (Ara(-/+)) sectoring colonies on TTC arabinose indicator plates. However, if the insertion is in an essential gene, only segregants that lose the MudJ insertion in the essential gene survive. In this case, selection for the insertion in the essential gene yields solid white (Ara(+)) colonies in the absence of tetracycline. While the specific design presented uses Mud transposon insertions to generate lac operon (transcriptional) and lacZ gene (translational) fusions to essential genes, this technique can be used to generate transposon insertions of any kind into essential genes.",0
17334997,"Fusion of the CREB regulated transcription coactivator CRTC1 (a.k.a. MECT1, TORC1, or WAMTP1) to the Notch coactivator MAML2 is a characteristic feature of low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas of salivary and bronchial glands. The CRTC1-MAML2 fusion protein acts by inducing transcription of cAMP/CREB target genes, and this activity is crucial for the transforming properties of the protein. Here we show that the CRTC1-MAML2 gene fusion is also frequent in benign hidradenomas of the skin. FISH and RT-PCR analyses revealed that hidradenomas are genetically heterogeneous, and that 10 of the 20 tumors analyzed (50%) contained the CRTC1-MAML2 gene fusion and expressed the resulting fusion transcript. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated expression of the fusion protein in the majority of tumor cells, including clear cells, poroid cells, and cells with epidermoid and ductal differentiation. In addition, we could show that all fusion-positive tumors were morphologically distinguished by the presence of more or less abundant areas of clear cells whereas all fusion-negative tumors lacked clear cells. Our findings thus demonstrate that the CRTC1-MAML2 gene fusion is frequent in hidradenomas and is associated with clear cell variants of this tumor. Taken together, the present and previous observations indicate that the CRTC1-MAML2 fusion is etiologically linked to benign and low-grade malignant tumors originating from diverse exocrine glands rather than being linked to a separate tumor entity.",1

17289424,"Annotation of the first few complete plant genomes has revealed that plants have many genes. For Arabidopsis, over 26,500 gene loci have been predicted, whereas for rice, the number adds up to 41,000. Recent analysis of the poplar genome suggests more than 45,000 genes, and partial sequence data from Medicago and Lotus also suggest that these plants contain more than 40,000 genes. Nevertheless, estimations suggest that ancestral angiosperms had no more than 12,000-14,000 genes. One explanation for the large increase in gene number during angiosperm evolution is gene duplication. It has been shown previously that the retention of duplicates following small- and large-scale duplication events in plants is substantial. Taking into account the function of genes that have been duplicated, we are now beginning to understand why many plant genes might have been retained, and how their retention might be linked to the typical lifestyle of plants.",0

To address the roles of MET and CDKN2A (p16INK4A/p14ARF) in human RMS, we performed mutational analyses in 39 samples of RMS by PCR-SSCP. No mutations were detected in exons 14-21 of MET whereas a nonsense mutation at codon 80 of p16(INK4A) was identified in an alveolar RMS cell line. We also quantified the relative expression levels and DNA copy numbers of these genes in seven cell lines and 17 fresh tumors by real-time quantitative PCR. Expression of MET was detected in all samples; however, more than 10-fold difference was found in the samples with higher or lower expression level, despite a normal DNA copy number. The protein expression level was consistent with that of mRNA, and in cell lines with a higher expression level, MET was constitutively activated. Notably, the expression level of MET was significantly higher in patients who died (P = 0.02), in patients with stage IV (P = 0.04), as well as in patients with PAX3-FKHR chimeric transcript (P = 0.04). On the other hand, reduced or absent expression of p16INK4A and/or p14(ARF) showed no significant correlation with the clinicopathological parameters, except for the age at diagnosis. Our data suggest that MET plays a role in the progression of RMS.",1
17240775,"Many educational psychologists believe that students' beliefs about the nature of knowledge, called epistemological beliefs, play an essential role in their learning process. Educators also stress the importance of helping students develop a better understanding of the nature of knowledge. The tentative and creative nature of science is often highlighted by contemporary science educators. However, few previous studies have investigated students' views of more specific knowledge domains, such as biology and physics. Consequently, this study developed a questionnaire to assess students' views specifically about the tentative and creative nature of biology and physics. From a survey of 428 Taiwanese high school adolescents, this study found that although students showed an understanding of the tentative and creative nature of biology and physics, they expressed stronger agreement as to the tentativeness of biology than that of physics. In addition, male students tended to agree more than did females that physics had tentative and creative features and that biology had tentative features. Also, students with more years of science education tended to show more agreement regarding the creative nature of physics and biology than those with fewer years.",0
17236192,"A series of 44 unrelated patients in whom COL2A1 screening demonstrated normal results but whose phenotype was nevertheless highly suggestive of either Stickler syndrome (with ocular involvement) or Marshall syndrome were investigated for mutations in the COL11A1 gene. Heterozygous COL11A1 mutations were found in 10 individuals. A splice site alteration (involving introns 47-55) was present in seven cases, with one in intron 50 (c.3816 + 1G > A) occurring in three patients. Two patients had a different deletion, and a missense mutation (Gly1471Asp) was observed in one case. In 4/10 patients the phenotype was classified as Marshall syndrome because of early-onset severe hearing loss and characteristic facial features. These four patients were all heterozygous for a splice site mutation in intron 50. One of these cases had a type 1 vitreous anomaly despite the presence of a COL11A1 mutation. The remaining 6/10 patients had an overlapping Marshall-Stickler phenotype with less pronounced facial features. None of these had a mutation in the hot spot region of intron 50.",1
17236135,"Colobomata represent visually impairing ocular closure defects that are associated with a diverse range of developmental anomalies. Characterization of a chromosome 8q21.2-q22.1 segmental deletion in a patient with chorioretinal coloboma revealed elements of nonallelic homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining. This genomic architecture extends the range of chromosomal rearrangements associated with human disease and indicates that a broader spectrum of human chromosomal rearrangements may use coupled homologous and nonhomologous mechanisms. We also demonstrate that the segmental deletion encompasses GDF6, encoding a member of the bone-morphogenetic protein family, and that inhibition of gdf6a in a model organism accurately recapitulates the proband's phenotype. The spectrum of disorders generated by morpholino inhibition and the more severe defects (microphthalmia and anophthalmia) observed at higher doses illustrate the key role of GDF6 in ocular development. These results underscore the value of integrated clinical and molecular investigation of patients with chromosomal anomalies.",1
17223258,"A genome-wide association analysis using the Affymetrix 100K SNP array was carried out in a case-control study of lung cancer. Allele frequencies were estimated initially in DNA pools. Significant differences in allele frequency detected in the SNP array analysis were first tested in the same DNA pools by pyrosequencing and then by individual genotyping. DNA pooling analysis identified rs10508266 SNP, located approximately 12.5kb from the 5'-end of the KLF6 gene, as a marker showing significant association with lung cancer risk. Since the SNP was in significant linkage disequilibrium with the KLF6 gene region, we analyzed an Italian population of 338 lung adenocarcinoma cases and 335 controls for the possible role of the reported functional rs3750861 SNP, located 15.6kb from the rs10508266 SNP. The rs3750861 affects expression of KLF6 splicing variants in prostate cancer and we found that its rare allele is associated with reduced lung cancer risk (odds ratio, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8). A Norwegian replication series of 265 non small cell lung cancer cases, and 356 controls, however, did not confirm the association. In light of the reported functional involvement of the KLF6 gene in lung cancer and in other cancer types and to the functional nature of the rs3750861 SNP, our results suggest a potential involvement of KLF6 polymorphisms in lung cancer risk, although additional studies in large series are needed to confirm our findings and to elucidate the mechanism by which the KLF6 SNPs influence lung cancer risk.",1
17218662,"Physicians have struggled with the medical ramifications of athletic competition since ancient Greece, where rational medicine and organized athletics originated. Historically, the relationship between sport and medicine was adversarial because of conflicts between health and sport. However, modern sports medicine has emerged with the goal of improving performance and preventing injury, and the concept of the ""team physician"" has become an integral part of athletic culture. With this distinction come unique ethical challenges because the customary ethical norms for most forms of clinical practice, such as confidentiality and patient autonomy, cannot be translated easily into sports medicine. The particular areas of medical ethics that present unique challenges in sports medicine are informed consent, third parties, advertising, confidentiality, drug use, and innovative technology. Unfortunately, there is no widely accepted code of sports medicine ethics that adequately addresses these issues.",0
17201371,"Two experiments examined adult humans' folk physics (i.e., their naturally occurring and spontaneous understanding of the physical world) using variations of trap-table problems used to study chimpanzees' folk physics. When presented with these problems, people unnecessarily avoided retrieving a reward by pulling a rake on the side of a table with a trapping hole--even though it was highly unlikely that the hole would trap the reward. However, when the distance between the reward and the trap was sufficiently large and the distance that the reward had to travel to be retrieved was sufficiently short, people preferred to retrieve a reward by pulling the rake on the side of the table with the trap. These results underscore that behavior during tool-use tasks has many possible causes, only one of which might be a subject's folk physics.",0
17188428,"Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (AFH) is a rare soft tissue tumor of low malignant potential and uncertain differentiation. Only three genetically investigated cases of AFH have been reported. Two of them displayed a FUS-ATF1 fusion gene and one showed an EWSR1-ATF1 chimera. Using RT-PCR analysis, we have identified the EWSR1-ATF1 fusion transcript, and delineated the genomic breakpoints, in two new cases of AFH. Previously, the EWSR1-ATF1 fusion protein has been suggested to activate expression of the MITF-M transcript, and therefore the expression pattern of the MITF gene was studied. The MITF-M transcript was not detected in either AFH, in line with the finding that the co-activator SOX10 was not expressed. Thus, of the five AFH that have been molecularly analyzed to date, two have displayed a FUS-ATF1 fusion gene and three have shown an EWSR1-ATF1 chimera. There is no apparent correlation between the type of fusion gene and clinicopathologic features. Nonetheless, RT-PCR for these fusion transcripts remains a valuable diagnostic adjunct in the distinction between AFH and other soft tissue tumors or metastases that may simulate it.",1

17187067,"Neutral lipid storage disease comprises a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by systemic accumulation of triglycerides in cytoplasmic droplets. Here we report a neutral lipid storage disease subgroup characterized by mild myopathy, absence of ichthyosis and mutations in both alleles of adipose triglyceride lipase (PNPLA2, also known as ATGL). Three of these mutations are predicted to lead to a truncated ATGL protein with an intact patatin domain containing the active site, but with defects in the hydrophobic domain. The block in triglyceride degradation was mimicked by short interfering RNA directed against ATGL. NLSDM is distinct from Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome, which is characterized by neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis, mild myopathy and hepatomegaly due to mutations in ABHD5 (also known as CGI-58).",0
17179669,"Collectins are a family of C-type lectins with two characteristic structures, collagen like domains and carbohydrate recognition domains. They recognize carbohydrate antigens on microorganisms and act as host-defense. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel collectin CL-K1. RT-PCR analyses showed CL-K1 mRNA is present in all organs. The deduced amino acid sequence and the data from immunostaining of CL-K1 cDNA expressing CHO cells revealed that CL-K1 is expressed as a secreted protein. CL-K1 is found in blood by immunoblotting and partial amino acid analyses. CL-K1 showed Ca(2+)-dependent sugar binding activity of fucose and weakly mannose but not N-acetyl-galactosamine, N-acetyl-glucosamine, or maltose, though mannose-binding lectin (MBL) containing similar amino acid motif. CL-K1 can recognize specially several bacterial saccharides due to specific sugar-binding character.

17174003,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to determine in a non-invasive way the concentrations of certain chemical substances, also called metabolites. The spectra of MRS signals contain peaks that correspond to the metabolites of interest. Short-echo-time signals are characterized by heavily overlapping metabolite peaks and require sophisticated processing methods. To be useful in a clinical environment tools are needed that can process those signals in an accurate and fast way. Therefore, we developed novel processing methods and we designed a freely available and open-source framework (http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/sista/members/biomed) in which the processing methods can be integrated. The framework has a set of abstract classes, called hot spots, and its goal is to provide a general structure and determine the control flow of the program. It provides building blocks or components in order to help developers with integrating their methods in the framework via a plug-in system. The framework is designed with the unified modeling language (UML) and implemented in Java. When a developer implements the framework he gets an application that acts like a simple and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for processing MRS data. This article describes in detail the structure and implementation of the framework and the integration of our processing methods in it.",0

17158188,"Tobacco use is a leading contributor to disability and death worldwide, and genetic factors contribute in part to the development of nicotine dependence. To identify novel genes for which natural variation contributes to the development of nicotine dependence, we performed a comprehensive genome wide association study using nicotine dependent smokers as cases and non-dependent smokers as controls. To allow the efficient, rapid, and cost effective screen of the genome, the study was carried out using a two-stage design. In the first stage, genotyping of over 2.4 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was completed in case and control pools. In the second stage, we selected SNPs for individual genotyping based on the most significant allele frequency differences between cases and controls from the pooled results. Individual genotyping was performed in 1050 cases and 879 controls using 31 960 selected SNPs. The primary analysis, a logistic regression model with covariates of age, gender, genotype and gender by genotype interaction, identified 35 SNPs with P-values less than 10(-4) (minimum P-value 1.53 x 10(-6)). Although none of the individual findings is statistically significant after correcting for multiple tests, additional statistical analyses support the existence of true findings in this group. Our study nominates several novel genes, such as Neurexin 1 (NRXN1), in the development of nicotine dependence while also identifying a known candidate gene, the beta3 nicotinic cholinergic receptor. This work anticipates the future directions of large-scale genome wide association studies with state-of-the-art methodological approaches and sharing of data with the scientific community.",1

17114103,"Electricity generation from landfill leachate was examined by using both a dual-chamber microbial fuel cell (MFC) and a single chamber MFC. Experimental results showed that the maximum power density of 2060.19 mW/m3 in the dual-chamber MFC and that of 6817.4 mW/m3 in the single chamber MFC were obtained. It was recognized that the difference in internal resistance for two MFC systems was the main reason for resulting in the difference of power generation. Power generation as function of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in single chamber MFC showed a Monod-type relationship with Pmax of 5920.96 mW/m3 and Ks of 251.39 mg/L at an external resistance of 500 Omega. Cyclic voltammetry showed that electrons were directly transferred onto the anode by bacteria in biofilms, rather than self-produced mediators of bacteria in the solutions. At low COD concentration, electricity generation was limited by the anode due to kinetic limitation; while at high COD concentration, the cathode was shown to have more significant effects on the electricity generation than the anode. COD in leachate could be removed when it increases, mainly because oxygen diffused from the cathode was substantially reduced by aerobic or anoxic bacteria in the anode chamber, leading to the substrate loss. Removal of ammonium-nitrogen was not observed in the single chamber MFC. This novel technology provides an economical route for electricity energy recovery in leachate treatment.",0
17098937,"Gene Ontology (GO) has been widely used to infer functional significance associated with sets of genes in order to automate discoveries within large-scale genetic studies. A level in GO's direct acyclic graph structure is often assumed to be indicative of its terms' specificities, although other work has suggested this assumption does not hold. Unfortunately, quantitative analysis of biological functions based on nodes at the same level (as is common in gene enrichment analysis tools) can lead to incorrect conclusions as well as missed discoveries due to inefficient use of available information. This paper addresses these using an informational theoretic approach encoded in the GO Partition Database that guarantees to maximize information for gene enrichment analysis. The GO Partition Database was designed to feature ontology partitions with GO terms of similar specificity. The GO partitions comprise varying numbers of nodes and present relevant information theoretic statistics, so researchers can choose to analyze datasets at arbitrary levels of specificity. The GO Partition Database, featuring GO partition sets for functional analysis of genes from human and 10 other commonly studied organisms with a total of 131,972 genes, is available on the internet at: bcl.med.harvard.edu/proj/gopart. The site also includes an online tutorial.",0
17086209,"Inhibition of the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) mechanism in cells results in stabilization of transcripts carrying premature translation termination codons. A strategy referred to as gene identification by NMD inhibition (GINI) has been proposed to identify genes carrying nonsense mutations. Genes containing frameshift mutations in colon cancer cell line have been identified using a modified version of GINI. To increase the efficiency of identifying mutant genes using GINI, we have now further improved the strategy. In this approach, inhibition of NMD with emetine is complemented with inhibiting NMD by blocking the phosphorylation of the hUpf1 protein with caffeine. In addition, to enhance the GINI strategy, comparing mRNA level alterations produced by inhibiting transcription alone or inhibiting transcription together with NMD following caffeine pretreatment were used for the efficient identification of false positives produced as a result of stress response to NMD inhibition. To demonstrate the improved efficiency of this approach, we analysed colon cancer cell lines showing microsatellite instability. Bi-allelic inactivating mutations were found in the FXR1, SEC31L1, NCOR1, BAT3, PHF14, ZNF294, C19ORF5 genes as well as genes coding for proteins with yet unknown functions.",1

These models are the ordinary multinomial logit (MNL) model, a hierarchical model based on a set of nested MNL models, and an MNL model with a prior that introduces correlations between the parameters for classes that are nearby in the hierarchy. We also provide a new scheme for combining different sources of information. We use these models to predict the functional class of Open Reading Frames (ORFs) from the E. coli genome.",0

17030554,"Chromosome 5q22-33 is a region where studies have repeatedly found evidence for linkage to schizophrenia. In this report, we took a stepwise approach to systematically map this region in the Irish Study of High Density Schizophrenia Families (ISHDSF, 267 families, 1337 subjects) sample. We typed 289 SNPs in the critical interval of 8 million basepairs and found a 758 kb interval coding for the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 genes to be associated with the disease. Using sex and genotype-conditioned transmission disequilibrium test analyses, we found that 19 of the 24 typed markers were associated with the disease and the associations were sex-specific. We replicated these findings with an Irish case-control sample (657 cases and 414 controls), an Irish parent-proband trio sample (187 families, 564 subjects), a German nuclear family sample (211 families, 751 subjects) and a Pittsburgh nuclear family sample (247 families, 729 subjects). In all four samples, we replicated the sex-specific associations at the levels of both individual markers and haplotypes using sex- and genotype-conditioned analyses. Three risk haplotypes were identified in the five samples, and each haplotype was found in at least two samples. Consistent with the discovery of multiple estrogen-response elements in this region, our data showed that the impact of these haplotypes on risk for schizophrenia differed in males and females. From these data, we concluded that haplotypes underlying the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 region are associated with schizophrenia. However, due to the extended high LD in this region, we were unable to distinguish whether the association signals came from one or more of these genes.",1
17028346,"Functional dependencies between genes are a defining characteristic of gene networks underlying quantitative traits. However, recent studies show that the proportion of the genetic variation that can be attributed to statistical epistasis varies from almost zero to very high. It is thus of fundamental as well as instrumental importance to better understand whether different functional dependency patterns among polymorphic genes give rise to distinct statistical interaction patterns or not. Here we address this issue by combining a quantitative genetic model approach with genotype-phenotype models capable of translating allelic variation and regulatory principles into phenotypic variation at the level of gene expression. We show that gene regulatory networks with and without feedback motifs can exhibit a wide range of possible statistical genetic architectures with regard to both type of effect explaining phenotypic variance and number of apparent loci underlying the observed phenotypic effect. Although all motifs are capable of harboring significant interactions, positive feedback gives rise to higher amounts and more types of statistical epistasis. The results also suggest that the inclusion of statistical interaction terms in genetic models will increase the chance to detect additional QTL as well as functional dependencies between genetic loci over a broad range of regulatory regimes. This article illustrates how statistical genetic methods can fruitfully be combined with nonlinear systems dynamics to elucidate biological issues beyond reach of each methodology in isolation.",0
17028096,"Exhaustive gene identification is a fundamental goal in all metagenomics projects. However, most metagenomic sequences are unassembled anonymous fragments, and conventional gene-finding methods cannot be applied. We have developed a prokaryotic gene-finding program, MetaGene, which utilizes di-codon frequencies estimated by the GC content of a given sequence with other various measures. MetaGene can predict a whole range of prokaryotic genes based on the anonymous genomic sequences of a few hundred bases, with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 90% for artificial shotgun sequences (700 bp fragments from 12 species). MetaGene has two sets of codon frequency interpolations, one for bacteria and one for archaea, and automatically selects the proper set for a given sequence using the domain classification method we propose. The domain classification works properly, correctly assigning domain information to more than 90% of the artificial shotgun sequences. Applied to the Sargasso Sea dataset, MetaGene predicted almost all of the annotated genes and a notable number of novel genes. MetaGene can be applied to wide variety of metagenomic projects and expands the utility of metagenomics.",0
16988395,"High content screening requires image processing algorithms that can accurately and robustly analyze large image numbers without requiring human intervention. Thus, a suite of algorithms that are directed by an understanding of the biology being studied was developed for the optimized automated acquisition and quantitation of cellular images. Two categories of directed algorithms were developed: Developer Tools for assay development and Specific Algorithms for turnkey screening of specific biological situations. The same basic sequence of analysis steps are used in these directed algorithms: 1. Primary object identification. 2. Measurement of primary object properties. 3. Identification and measurements of associated targets. 4. Analysis of raw measurements for specific biological problems. The detailed application of these steps is guided by the biology being studied and the expected phenotypic changes. Most cell biological problems to be analyzed using high content screening can be categorized by either the phenotype of the problem or labeling pattern, or by a standard biological response behavior of the cells. This enables application of directed algorithms optimized for these categories. Examples of the use of directed algorithms for specific categories are discussed, as well as the detailed analysis steps for a specific directed algorithm.",0
16983642,"The NF2 tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 is a member of the protein 4.1 family of cytoskeletal elements. A number of single- and multiple-tumor phenotypes have been linked to alterations of NF2 since its characterization in 1993. We present a meta-analysis of 967 constitutional and somatic NF2 alterations from 93 published reports, along with 59 additional unpublished events identified in our laboratory and 115 alterations identified in clinical samples submitted to the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Neurogenetics DNA Diagnostic Laboratory. In total, these sources defined 1,070 small genetic changes detected primarily by exon scanning, 42 intragenic changes of one whole exon or larger, and 29 whole gene deletions and gross chromosomal rearrangements. Constitutional single-exon events (N=422) were significantly more likely to be nonsense or splice site changes than somatic events (N=533), which favored frameshift changes (chi(2) test; P<0.001). Somatic events also differed markedly between tumors of different pathology, most significantly in the tendency of somatic events in meningiomas to lie within the 5' FERM domain of the transcript (Fisher's exact test; P<0.01 in comparison to schwannomas) with a complete absence of mutations in exons 14 and 15. There was no statistically significant difference in mutation type or exon distribution between published constitutional events and those found by the clinical laboratory. Less than 10% of all published and unpublished small alterations are nontruncating (N=63) and these changes are clustered in exons 2 and 3, suggesting that this region may be especially crucial to tumor suppressor activity in the protein.",1
16980187,"The received view on the contributions of the physics community to the birth of molecular biology tends to present the physics community as sharing a basic level consensus on how physics should be brought to bear on biology. I argue, however, that a close examination of the views of three leading physicists involved in the birth of molecular biology, Bohr, Delbrück, and Schrödinger, suggests that there existed fundamental disagreements on how physics should be employed to solve problems in biology even within the physics community. In particular, I focus on how these three figures differed sharply in their assessment of the relevance of complementarity, the potential of chemical methods, and the relative importance of classical physics. In addition, I assess and develop Roll-Hansen's attempt to conceptualize this history in terms of models of scientific change advanced by Kuhn and Lakatos. Though neither model is fully successful in explaining the divergence of views among these three physicists, I argue that the extent and quality of difference in their views help elucidate and extend some themes that are left opaque in Kuhn's model.",0

16967261,"The fast growing field of molecular imaging has achieved major advances in imaging gene expression, an important element of gene therapy. Gene expression imaging is based on specific probes or contrast agents that allow either direct or indirect spatio-temporal evaluation of gene expression. Direct evaluation is possible with, for example, contrast agents that bind directly to a specific target (e.g., receptor). Indirect evaluation may be achieved by using specific substrate probes for a target enzyme. The use of marker genes, also called reporter genes, is an essential element of MI approaches for gene expression in gene therapy. The marker gene may not have a therapeutic role itself, but by coupling the marker gene to a therapeutic gene, expression of the marker gene reports on the expression of the therapeutic gene. Nuclear medicine and optical approaches are highly sensitive (detection of probes in the picomolar range), whereas MRI and ultrasound imaging are less sensitive and require amplification techniques and/or accumulation of contrast agents in enlarged contrast particles. Recently developed MI techniques are particularly relevant for gene therapy. Amongst these are the possibility to track gene therapy vectors such as stem cells, and the techniques that allow spatiotemporal control of gene expression by non-invasive heating (with MRI guided focused ultrasound) and the use of temperature sensitive promoters.",0
16960149,"Integrative genomic and gene-expression analyses have identified amplified oncogenes in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), but the capability of such technologies to localize tumor suppressor genes within homozygous deletions remains unexplored. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and gene-expression microarray analysis of 48 cell lines derived from patients with different B-NHLs delineated 20 homozygous deletions at 7 chromosome areas, all of which contained tumor suppressor gene targets. Further investigation revealed that only a fraction of primary biopsies presented inactivation of these genes by point mutation or intragenic deletion, but instead some of them were frequently silenced by epigenetic mechanisms. Notably, the pattern of genetic and epigenetic inactivation differed among B-NHL subtypes. Thus, the P53-inducible PIG7/LITAF was silenced by homozygous deletion in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma and by promoter hypermethylation in germinal center lymphoma, the proapoptotic BIM gene presented homozygous deletion in mantle cell lymphoma and promoter hypermethylation in Burkitt lymphoma, the proapoptotic BH3-only NOXA was mutated and preferentially silenced in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and INK4c/P18 was silenced by biallelic mutation in mantle-cell lymphoma. Our microarray strategy has identified novel candidate tumor suppressor genes inactivated by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that substantially vary among the B-NHL subtypes.",1
16957889,"A retrospective study of 34 feet from 20 consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis was performed to investigate the development of damage to the hallux over 5 years after forefoot resection arthroplasty. Radiographically we analysed changes in two valgus angles and the interphalangeal joint (IP) damage of the hallux. These parameters were measured preoperatively, 12 months postoperatively, and at the latest follow-up. Although the average HVA (between the first metatarsal and the proximal phalanx) significantly decreased from 38.7 degrees preoperatively to 8.66 degrees postoperatively, the angle increased to 23.0 degrees during the first 12 months following surgery. Further deterioration of the angle at the last follow-up was not detected (25.3 degrees ; P=0.252). The average IPV (between the proximal phalanx and the distal phalanx) angle significantly increased from 6.65 degrees preoperatively to 12.1 degrees 12 months postoperatively and thereafter slightly increased to 13.3 degrees at the latest follow-up. The average of the Sharp/van der Heijde score of the IP joint significantly increased from 5.71 preoperatively to 8.58 12 months postoperatively and thereafter slightly increased to 9.65 at the latest follow-up. The deterioration and destruction process of the hallux after resection arthroplasty occurred soon after surgery, and the progression of the deformity was temporary.",0

The LAMB2 gene, which was recently reported as mutated in Pierson syndrome (microcoria-congenital nephrosis syndrome; OMIM #609049), was located in the linkage interval. Sequencing of all coding exons of LAMB2 revealed a novel homozygous missense mutation (R246Q) in both affected children. A different mutation at this codon (R246W), which is highly conserved through evolution, has recently been reported as causing Pierson syndrome. Subsequent LAMB2 mutational screening in six additional families with congenital nephrotic syndrome revealed compound heterozygosity for two novel missense mutations in one family with additional nonspecific ocular anomalies. These findings demonstrate that the spectrum of LAMB2-associated disorders is broader than previously anticipated and includes congenital nephrotic syndrome without eye anomalies or with minor ocular changes different from those observed in Pierson syndrome. This phenotypic variability likely reflects specific genotypes. We conclude that mutational analysis in LAMB2 should be considered in congenital nephrotic syndrome, if no mutations are found in NPHS1, NPHS2, or WT1.",1
16900093,"ADAM19, an enzyme from the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family, is involved in various cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. It can cleave epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factors, such as heparin-binding (HB)-EGF and neuregulin (NRG), from the cell membrane. ADAM-mediated EGF receptor activation is crucial in the development of renal pathology. Based on these data, we studied ADAM19 in human nephrogenesis and renal disease. We collected 20 fetal kidneys and 56 biopsies from patients with various renal diseases. The unaffected part of kidneys from eight patients with renal cell carcinoma served as control. RNA in situ hybridization revealed widespread ADAM19 mRNA expression in the nephrogenic zone of human fetal kidneys. Normal human kidneys showed constitutive ADAM19 expression in distal tubules and endothelial cells, whereas proximal tubules were negative. In renal disease, ADAM19 was de novo expressed in proximal tubules and glomerular mesangium and upregulated in distal tubules and endothelial cells. ADAM19 colocalized with tubular and interstitial NRG, however, not with HB-EGF. Independent of renal disorder, mesangial ADAM19 expression was associated with glomerular damage as assessed by mesangial matrix expansion, focal glomerulosclerosis, and glomerular macrophage influx (all P<0.001). ADAM19 in proximal tubules and in peritubular capillaries was associated with interstitial fibrosis (P<0.05). Finally, increasing tubular ADAM19 was associated with declining renal function (P<0.05). The abundant ADAM19 expression during nephrogenesis points to a role in growth promotion and regulation. The high ADAM19 expression in renal disease suggests involvement in profibrotic and proinflammatory processes leading to renal deterioration.",1
16894352,"A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)15 is upregulated in some tissues undergoing remodeling. This glycoprotein is characterized by adhesive function through its interaction with members of the integrin family and protease properties. The goal of this work was to describe the tissue distribution of ADAM15 and its spatial relationship with its known binding partners in inflammatory bowel disease. ADAM15 expression was examined using frozen tissues from eight patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease and four normal colons by immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In addition expression of alpha5beta1- and alphavbeta3-integrins, VE-cadherin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and collagen IV was examined using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. In the normal colon, ADAM15 was expressed by all epithelial cells throughout the crypt and by pericryptic myofibroblasts coexpressing alpha-SMA and collagen IV. ADAM15 was also expressed by endothelial cells and vascular myocytes in all layers of the intestinal wall as well as by nonvascular myocytes of the muscularis mucosae and muscularis propria. In inflammatory bowel diseases, ADAM15 was strongly upregulated at the mRNA level and expressed only as an active form as shown by immunoblotting analysis. Parallel to its upregulation, ADAM15 expression was found both at the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells in acute attacks of the disease. In the crypt abcesses, ADAM15-positive epithelial cells were in close contact with alpha5beta1-integrin-positive leukocytes localized between these cells and in the crypt lumen. In the regenerative areas, ADAM15-positive epithelial cells were in close contact with alpha5beta1- and alphavbeta3-positive pericryptic myofibroblasts. In endothelial cells, VE-cadherin was decreased. In contrast, ADAM15 was strongly expressed by endothelial cells and was in close contact with alpha5beta1-positive leukocytes. There is a differential expression of ADAM15 in epithelial cells during inflammatory bowel disease compared with the normal colon. In addition, the spatial relationships with its binding partners suggest a role for ADAM15 in the differentiation of regenerative colonic mucosa as well as in leukocyte transmigration across epithelial and endothelial barriers.",1
16892944,"Historians have convincingly shown the close ties U.S. physicists had with the military during the Cold War and have raised the question of whether this alliance affected the content of physics. Some have asserted that it distorted physics, shifting attention from fundamental problems to devices. Yet the papers of physicists in quantum electronics and quantum optics, fields that have been exemplary for those who hold the distortion thesis, show that the same scientists who worked on military devices simultaneously pursued fundamental and foundational topics. This essay examines one such physicist, Marlan O. Scully, with attention to both his extensive foundational studies and the way in which his applied and basic researches played off each other.",0
16845043,"AUGUSTUS is a software tool for gene prediction in eukaryotes based on a Generalized Hidden Markov Model, a probabilistic model of a sequence and its gene structure. Like most existing gene finders, the first version of AUGUSTUS returned one transcript per predicted gene and ignored the phenomenon of alternative splicing. Herein, we present a WWW server for an extended version of AUGUSTUS that is able to predict multiple splice variants. To our knowledge, this is the first ab initio gene finder that can predict multiple transcripts. In addition, we offer a motif searching facility, where user-defined regular expressions can be searched against putative proteins encoded by the predicted genes.

16842783,"It has been proposed that one function of introns is to coordinate expression across/within networks of related genes. This same hypothesis also predicts that intronless genes will not be uniformly distributed among the functional categories of human genes, but will be found most frequently in those categories that have less need to communicate changes in their expression. Statistical analysis demonstrates significant clustering of single exon genes among those with binding or signal transduction/receptor activities and fewer than expected among those with catalytic function.",0
16840197,"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is a heterogenous disease with a highly variable clinical course. Recent studies have shown that expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and ADAM29 may serve as novel prognostic markers in B-CLL. To investigate the prognostic value of these genes, we quantified their expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in a cohort of 133 B-CLL patients and correlated the results with clinical outcome, and other known prognostic factors. LPL, ADAM29, LPL and ADAM29 ratios, as well as CD38 and ZAP-70 protein expression determined by multiparameter flow cytometry, were predictive of treatment-free survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified LPL, ADAM29 and CD38 as independent prognostic markers. Evaluation of several disease characteristics in association with the LPL expression status of the patients' B-CLL cells showed highly significant differences for CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, suggesting a correlation of LPL expression with these established adverse prognostic factors. Sequential RQ-PCR analyses in a subset of 22 patients revealed that LPL mRNA expression was relatively stable in the majority of patients, whereas ADAM29 expression levels varied substantially over time. Furthermore, in a subgroup analysis, LPL provided prognostic information in both early stage (Binet A) and patients with more advanced disease (Binet B and C). Conversely, high ADAM29 expression was predictive of a long treatment-free interval in Binet stage A but did not retain its prognostic significance in Binet B and C patients. The LPL/ADAM29 expression ratio was not found to be an independent prognostic factor and did not offer any advantages over the use of LPL alone. Collectively, our data confirm a role for LPL as a novel prognostic indicator in B-CLL.",1
16825431,"Patients with biallelic mutations in BRCA2 are in Fanconi anaemia group D1. We analysed the severity of the mutations in 27 cases, classified according to their association with breast cancer in heterozygotes, and their predicted functional effect. Twenty mutations were frameshifts or truncations, three involved splice sites, five were missense variants of unknown severity and two were benign polymorphisms. Five patients had VACTERL-H association. Leukaemia was reported in 13 patients, and solid tumours in 15; 6 patients had two or more malignancies. The cumulative probability of any malignancy was 97% by age 5.2 years. IVS7+1G-->A and IVS7+2T-->G were associated with AML, and 886delGT and 6174delT with brain tumours. However, patients with other alleles remained at very high risk of these events. Missense mutations formed a distinct cluster in a highly conserved region of the BRCA2 protein. The small group of patients with biallelic mutations in BRCA2 is distinctive in the severity of the phenotype, and early onset and high rates of leukaemia and specific solid tumours, and may comprise an extreme variant of Fanconi anaemia. Several of the alleles were not associated with cancer in presumed carriers, and thus counselling presents more uncertainties than usual.",1

For many genome sequences, the only annotation that will be available for the foreseeable future will be based on computational predictions and comparisons with functional elements in related species.

These include methods for ab initio and comparative gene-structure predictions. Gene features such as intron splice sites, 3' untranslated regions, promoters, and cis-regulatory elements are discussed, as is a novel method for predicting DNaseI hypersensitive sites. Recent methodologies for predicting noncoding RNA genes, including microRNA genes and their targets, are also reviewed.",0

16818673,"Germline mutations in five autosomal genes involved in interleukin (IL)-12-dependent, interferon (IFN)-gamma-mediated immunity cause Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD). The molecular basis of X-linked recessive (XR)-MSMD remains unknown. We report here mutations in the leucine zipper (LZ) domain of the NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO) gene in three unrelated kindreds with XR-MSMD. The mutant proteins were produced in normal amounts in blood and fibroblastic cells. However, the patients' monocytes presented an intrinsic defect in T cell-dependent IL-12 production, resulting in defective IFN-gamma secretion by T cells. IL-12 production was also impaired as the result of a specific defect in NEMO- and NF-kappaB/c-Rel-mediated CD40 signaling after the stimulation of monocytes and dendritic cells by CD40L-expressing T cells and fibroblasts, respectively. However, the CD40-dependent up-regulation of costimulatory molecules of dendritic cells and the proliferation and immunoglobulin class switch of B cells were normal. Moreover, the patients' blood and fibroblastic cells responded to other NF-kappaB activators, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, and lipopolysaccharide. These two mutations in the NEMO LZ domain provide the first genetic etiology of XR-MSMD. They also demonstrate the importance of the T cell- and CD40L-triggered, CD40-, and NEMO/NF-kappaB/c-Rel-mediated induction of IL-12 by monocyte-derived cells for protective immunity to mycobacteria in humans.",1
16804117,"Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is characterized by neutropenia, recurrent bacterial infections, and maturation arrest in the bone marrow. Although many cases have mutations in the ELA2 gene encoding neutrophil elastase, a significant proportion remain undefined at a molecular level. A mutation (Leu270Pro) in the gene encoding the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) resulting in an X-linked SCN kindred has been reported. We therefore screened the WAS gene in 14 young SCN males with wild-type ELA2 and identified 2 with novel mutations, one who presented with myelodysplasia (Ile294Thr) and the other with classic SCN (Ser270Pro). Both patients had defects of immunologic function including a generalized reduction of lymphoid and natural killer cell numbers, reduced lymphocyte proliferation, and abrogated phagocyte activity. In vitro culture of bone marrow progenitors demonstrated a profound reduction in neutrophil production and increased levels of apoptosis, consistent with an intrinsic disturbance of normal myeloid differentiation as the cause of the neutropenia. Both mutations resulted in increased WASp activity and produced marked abnormalities of cytoskeletal structure and dynamics. Furthermore, these results also suggest a novel cause of myelodysplasia and that male children with myelodysplasia and disturbance of immunologic function should be screened for such mutations.",1

16783566,"Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a well-known autosomal dominant mental retardation syndrome with typical facial and skeletal abnormalities. Previously, we have reported two patients presenting with RSTS and additional clinical features including failure to thrive, seizures, and intractable infections (Bartsch et al. in Eur J Hum Genet 7:748-756, 1999). Recently we identified a third patient with this condition, termed here severe RSTS, or chromosome 16p13.3 deletion syndrome. The three patients died in infancy, and all displayed a specific mutation, a chromosomal microdeletion including the 3'-end of the CREBBP gene. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization and closely spaced DNA probes, we characterized the deletion intervals in these patients and in three individuals with a deletion of CREBBP and typical RSTS. The deleted DNA segments were found to greatly vary in size, spanning from approximately 40 kb to >3 Mb. Four individuals, including the patients with severe RSTS, exhibited deletions containing gene/s in addition to CREBBP. The patients with severe RSTS all had deletions comprising telomeric neighbor genes of CREBBP, including DNASE1, a dominant gene encoding a nuclease that has been associated with systemic lupus erythematodes. Our findings suggest that severe RSTS is distinct from RSTS and represents a novel true contiguous gene syndrome (chromosome 16p13.3 deletion syndrome). Because of the risk of critical infections and high mortality rate, we recommend that the size of the deletion interval should be determined in CREBBP deletion-positive patients with RSTS, especially in young children. Further studies are needed to delineate the clinical spectrum of the new disorder and to clarify the role of DNASE1.",1
16778836,"It is well established that some reduced fermentation products or microbially reduced artificial mediators can abiotically react with electrodes to yield a small electrical current. This type of metabolism does not typically result in an efficient conversion of organic compounds to electricity because only some metabolic end products will react with electrodes, and the microorganisms only incompletely oxidize their organic fuels. A new form of microbial respiration has recently been discovered in which microorganisms conserve energy to support growth by oxidizing organic compounds to carbon dioxide with direct quantitative electron transfer to electrodes. These organisms, termed electricigens, offer the possibility of efficiently converting organic compounds into electricity in self-sustaining systems with long-term stability.",0
16777745,"Recent genome analyses revealed intriguing correlations between variables characterizing the functioning of a gene, such as expression level (EL), connectivity of genetic and protein-protein interaction networks, and knockout effect, and variables describing gene evolution, such as sequence evolution rate (ER) and propensity for gene loss. Typically, variables within each of these classes are positively correlated, e.g. products of highly expressed genes also have a propensity to be involved in many protein-protein interactions, whereas variables between classes are negatively correlated, e.g. highly expressed genes, on average, evolve slower than weakly expressed genes. Here, we describe principal component (PC) analysis of seven genome-related variables and propose biological interpretations for the first three PCs. The first PC reflects a gene's 'importance', or the 'status' of a gene in the genomic community, with positive contributions from knockout lethality, EL, number of protein-protein interaction partners and the number of paralogues, and negative contributions from sequence ER and gene loss propensity. The next two PCs define a plane that seems to reflect the functional and evolutionary plasticity of a gene. Specifically, PC2 can be interpreted as a gene's 'adaptability' whereby genes with high adaptability readily duplicate, have many genetic interaction partners and tend to be non-essential. PC3 also might reflect the role of a gene in organismal adaptation albeit with a negative rather than a positive contribution of genetic interactions; we provisionally designate this PC 'reactivity'. The interpretation of PC2 and PC3 as measures of a gene's plasticity is compatible with the observation that genes with high values of these PCs tend to be expressed in a condition- or tissue-specific manner. Functional classes of genes substantially vary in status, adaptability and reactivity, with the highest status characteristic of the translation system and cytoskeletal proteins, highest adaptability seen in cellular processes and signalling genes, and top reactivity characteristic of metabolic enzymes.",0
16756544,"The complete mitochondrial genome of the bristletail Petrobius brevistylis has been determined. The genome is 15,698 bp long and bears the standard set of genes common to all arthropods as well as a major non-coding A+T-rich region, the putative mitochondrial control region. A unique gene order was revealed as it differs from other hexapod and crustacean mitochondrial genomes in the position of tRNA-Tyr. Genome features like nucleotide composition and codon usage are compared with that of other insect taxa. A+T content is similar in species of Archaeognatha and Zygentoma, but obviously lower than in Collembola and Pterygota. This A+T bias significantly affects also amino acid frequencies and may be a problem for phylogenetic analyses.",1

16736500,"Pleomorphic salivary gland adenomas are characterized by recurrent chromosome rearrangements of 8q12, leading to activation of the PLAG1 oncogene. Here we demonstrate that CHCHD7-PLAG1 is a novel and recurrent gene fusion generated by a cytogenetically cryptic rearrangement in pleomorphic adenomas. CHCHD7 is a newly identified member of a multifamily of proteins containing a conserved (coiled coil 1)-(helix 1)-(coiled coil 2)-(helix 2) domain. Northern blot analysis revealed that the gene is ubiquitously expressed. Its biological function is unknown and the gene has hitherto not been associated with neoplasia. CHCHD7 and PLAG1 are located head-to-head about 500 bp apart in 8q12. Molecular analyses of 27 tumors revealed CHCHD7-PLAG1 fusions in three tumors, two of which had t(6;8) and t(8;15) translocations as the sole anomalies and one a normal karyotype. FISH analyses of interphase nuclei and nuclear chromatin fibers of a fourth adenoma with a normal karyotype revealed that a second fusion partner gene, TCEA1, located about 2 Mb centromeric to PLAG1, also is fused to PLAG1 as a result of a cryptic 8q rearrangement. The breakpoints in both fusions occur in the 5'-noncoding regions of the genes, leading to activation of PLAG1 by promoter swapping/substitution. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that the PLAG1 protein was overexpressed in epithelial, myoepithelial, and mesenchymal-like tumor cells in tumors with both fusions. Our findings further emphasize the significance of PLAG1 activation in pleomorphic adenomas and demonstrate that the gene is more frequently activated than previously anticipated.",1

16721043,"Sequence mutations and gene amplifications lead to activation of the PIK3CA-AKT2 signaling pathway and have been reported in several types of neoplasms including ovarian cancer. Analysis of such genetic alterations, however, is usually complicated by contamination of normal cell DNA, artifacts associated with formalin-fixed tissues and the sensitivity of the techniques employed. In this study, we analyzed the sequence mutations in PIK3CA and AKT2 genes using purified tumor cells that were isolated from high-grade ovarian serous carcinomas and serous borderline tumors (SBTs) and assessed gene amplification using a dual-color FISH on tissue microarrays. Somatic sequence mutations in the kinase domain of AKT2 were not detected in any of the 65 ovarian tumors analyzed. Mutations of PIK3CA were rare, occurring only in one (2.3%) of 44 high-grade serous carcinomas and in only one (4.8%) of 21 SBTs. Dual-color FISH demonstrated that PIK3CA and AKT2 were not amplified in SBTs but amplified in 13.3% and 18.2% high-grade carcinomas, respectively. High-level amplification (>3 fold) was more frequently observed in AKT2 than in PIK3CA. Unlike mutations in ERBB2, KRAS and BRAF which are mutually exclusive in SBTs, coamplification of PIK3CA and AKT2 was present in five high-grade carcinomas including the OVCAR3 cells. Amplification in either of the genes occurred in 27% high-grade serous carcinomas. In conclusion, the methods we employed provide unambiguous evidence that somatic sequence mutations of PIK3CA and ATK2 are rare in ovarian serous tumors but amplification of both genes may play an important role in the development of high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma.",1
16714191,"Astroparticle physics is an interdisciplinary field that explores the connections between the physics of elementary particles and the large-scale properties of the universe. Particle physicists have developed a standard model to describe the properties of matter in the quantum world. This model explains the bewildering array of particles in terms of constructs made from two or three quarks. Quarks, leptons, and three of the fundamental forces of physics are the main components of this standard model. Cosmologists have also developed a standard model to describe the bulk properties of the universe. In this new framework, ordinary matter, such as stars and galaxies, makes up only around 4% of the material universe. The bulk of the universe is dark matter (roughly 23%) and dark energy (about 73%). This dark energy drives an acceleration that means that the expanding universe will grow ever larger. String theory, in which the universe has several invisible dimensions, might offer an opportunity to unite the quantum description of the particle world with the gravitational properties of the large-scale universe.",0
16707929,"Activation of prothrombin to thrombin is the key reaction in blood coagulation cascade. We have recently shown that Australian rough scaled snake, Tropidechis carinatus, possesses two parallel prothrombin activator systems. Trocarin D, a venom prothrombin activator produced in the venom gland, plays an offensive role as a toxin, whereas factor X is produced in the liver and plays a role in the hemostatic mechanism. These two proteins are structurally similar and have identical domain architecture. Because of the differences in their physiological roles, and tissue-specific expression, we determined the gene structure of these closely related proteins. Both the genes have eight exons similar to all mammalian factor X genes. All the exon-intron boundaries of these two genes are at the same position and the splice junctions are almost identical. Partial sequencing of the introns shows that they share a very high degree of sequence identity indicating that the gene duplication is a recent event. Further studies on the characterization of these two genes particularly the promoter regions are in progress.",0
16683960,"In this study, we have developed an implantable electronics unit (IEU) for driving an undulation pump-left ventricular assist device (UP-LVAD). The IEU consists of a pump driver, three series-connected lithium ion batteries (1800 mAh), a charger, and a transcutaneous information transmission system. These electronic subunits were encapsulated in a case (110 x approximately 80 x approximately 30 mm) made of epoxy resin. The IEU was evaluated in two animal experiments using goats implanted with the UP-LVAD. The lithium ion batteries in the IEU provided 30-min energy supply daily to the UP-LVAD. The transcutaneous information transmission system transmitted data bidirectionally between the IEU and the personal computer at the data transmission ratio of 56 kbps without any transmission error. We could obtain survival days of 27 and 28 days supporting cardiac function with the UP-LVAD system. The temperature inside the IEU case was maintained under 45 degrees C, and there was evidence of a burn on the surrounding tissue in autopsies in each experiment. Based on the results, the IEU is promising to be suitable for drive and control of an implantable UP-LVAD.",0

16598499,"The vast majority of tumors of the pancreas are ductal adenocarcinomas. This cancer type has an extremely poor prognosis and in many Western countries, it represents the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas exhibit the highest incidence of activating KRAS (Ki-Ras) mutations observed in any human cancer. It was therefore of interest to examine how this pattern would relate to mutations in the BRAF and EGFR genes, which are involved in the same signaling pathway as KRAS. We screened a series of 43 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas. When DNA was extracted from whole tissue sections, KRAS codon 12 mutations were detected in 67% of the tumors. When cancerous ducts were isolated by laser-assisted microdissection, 91% were positive for KRAS mutations. Although it did not reach statistical significance, there was a trend in our material that survival after diagnosis varied according to KRAS mutation subtype, GTT-positive patients having the best prognosis. No alterations in BRAF exons 11 and 15 or in EGFR exons 18-21 were detected in KRAS-positive or KRAS-negative cases. We therefore conclude that the BRAF and EGFR mutations commonly seen in a variety of human cancers are generally absent from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. Apparently, these tumors depend on no more than one genetic hit in the EGFR-RAS-RAF signaling pathway.",1
16596670,"The recent identification of TGFBR2 mutations in Marfan syndrome II (MFSII) [Mizuguchi et al. (2004); Nat Genet 36:855-860] and of TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 mutations in Loeys-Dietz aortic aneurysm syndrome (LDS) [Loeys et al. (2005); Nat Genet 37:275-281] [OMIM 609192] has provided direct evidence of abnormal signaling in transforming growth factors beta (TGF-beta) in the pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome (MFS). In light of this, we describe the phenotypes and genotypes of five individuals. Patient 1 had MFS and abnormal cranial dura. Patient 2 had severe early onset MFS and an abnormal skull. Patients 3 and 4 had probable Furlong syndrome (FS). Patient 5 had marfanoid (MD) features, mental retardation (MR), and a deletion of chromosome 15q21.1q21.3. All patients had a condition within the MFS, MD-craniosynostosis (CS) or MD-MR spectrum. The names of these entities may become redundant, and instead, come to be considered within the spectrum of TGF-beta signaling pathway disorders. Two recurrent heterozygous FBN1 mutations were found in Patients 1 and 2, and an identical novel heterozygous de novo TGFBR1 mutation was found in Patients 3 and 4, in whom altered fibrillin-1 processing was demonstrated previously [Milewicz et al. (2000); Am J Hum Genet 67:279]. A heterozygous FBN1 deletion was found in Patient 5. These findings support the notion that perturbation of extracellular matrix homeostasis and/or remodeling caused by abnormal TGF-beta signaling is the core pathogenetic mechanism in MFS and related entities including the MD-CS syndromes.",1

16532805,"On the basis of our previous work, the electric frequency property of human blood in different components, in physiological state and in pathological state (diabetes) are tested and analyzed in the range of 1Hz-20MHz progressively. Among the different components of blood; the lowest electrical impedance is serum; the plasma and the whole blood gradually become larger, the blood corpuscle is the largest one. Otherwise, the negative phase of serum is the largest, the plasma and the whole blood are lower, and the blood corpuscle is the lowest. Here, the question is why the effect of the electric capacity of serum and plasma is the biggest in the condition of no cell and cell membrane; diabetes mellitus is an endocrine disorder in which blood changes obviously, the electric frequency property of the blood of diabetic patients changes markedly; the electrical impedance of blood decreases (more obviously with low frequency), the negative phase increases (more obviously with high frequency). These indicate that the increase of electric conductivity in diabetic patients' blood is due to electric capacitance conductivity that is related to the changes of cell membrane, deformation abilities and aggregation of RBC. Related experiments demonstrate again that with the progressing of research in the electric frequency property of blood, we may use the theory and method of electricity to examine some important characters of blood in a different way, and so to corroborate other tests and analyses.",0
16480787,"Although similarities in gene expression among tissues are commonly inferred to reflect functional constraints, this has never been formally tested. Furthermore, it is unclear which evolutionary processes are responsible for the observed similarities. When examining genome-wide expression data in mouse, we found that patterns of expression similarity between tissues extend to genes that are unlikely to function in the tissues. Thus, ectopic expression can seem coordinated across tissues. This indicates that knowledge of gene expression patterns per se is insufficient to infer gene function. Ectopic expression is possibly explained as expression leakage, caused by spreading of chromatin modifications or the transcription apparatus into neighboring genes.",0
16472244,"The human genome project has been completed, but the function of many genes is unknown. It is, therefore, necessary to elucidate the function of a large number of genes within a short time. To achieve this goal, materials are needed that condense or package DNA into nano-particles that can easily be taken up by cells and would allow DNA to be retained without degradation. Atelocollagen is a reliable carrier for gene delivery because it is considered safe and appropriate for practical use. We developed a basic technique for high-throughput gene transfer and expression screening by pre-coating a multi-well plate with an Atelocollagen/DNA complex in which cells are then seeded. Complexes with a nano-particle form were efficiently transduced into cells without the use of additional transfection reagents, and they allowed for long-term gene expression. The complex spotted onto the well of a plate was stable for a long period and allowed the cells to transduce and express reporter genes. We also showed that the present method with Atelocollagen-based gene transfer is applicable to gene medicines, such as antisense ODNs, siRNA, and adenovirus vectors. These results suggest that an Atelocollagen-based cell transfection array may be appropriate for general use in the high-throughput screening of large sets of gene medicines with functions in mammalian cells.",0

The present review attempts to integrate them as a tribute to Einstein in commemoration of this centenary. These contributions can be classified into three basic areas: geodynamics, geological (planetary) catastrophism, and fluvial geomorphology. Regarding geodynamics, Einstein essentially supported Hapgood's very controversial theory called Earth Crust Displacement. With respect to geological (planetary) catastrophism, it is shown how the ideas of Einstein about Velikovsky's proposals evolved from 1946 to 1955. Finally, in relation to fluvial geodynamics, the review incorporates the elegant work in which Einstein explains the formation of meandering rivers. A general analysis of his contributions is also carried out from today's perspective. Given the interdisciplinarity and implications of Einstein's achievements to multiple fields of knowledge, we propose that the year 2005 serve, rather than to confine his universal figure within a specific scientific area, to broaden it for a better appreciation of this brilliant scientist in all of his dimensions.",0
16436456,"PTEN, a dual-phosphatase tumor suppressor, is inactivated in Cowden syndrome (CS), characterized by high risk of breast and thyroid cancer, and in variety of sporadic cancers. Despite the importance of alternative splicing, very limited information on its role in PTEN and associated cancers is available. We identified eight novel PTEN splice variants (SVs) that retained intron 3 regions (3a, 3b, 3c); intron 5 regions (5a, 5b, 5c); excluded part of exon 5 (DelE5) or all of exon 6 (DelE6), respectively. Analysis of SVs in 12 sporadic breast cancers revealed full-length (FL)-PTEN transcript reduction in 10; SVs 3b, 3c and 5c not expressed in 7, 6 and 4, respectively, and under-expressed in the rest. In contrast, SV-5b was over-expressed in breast cancers. PTEN SV analysis in 16 CS/CS-like patients and eight controls revealed that SV-5a is under-expressed and SV-3a over-expressed in the germline of CS/CS-like individuals when compared with controls. Although SV-5a expression decreased P-Akt level and cyclin D1 promoter activity, SVs 5b and 5c increased cyclin D1 promoter activity. Thus, SV-5a behaving like FL-PTEN corroborates our observation that SV-5a is under-expressed in CS when compared with controls. Similarly, SV-5b functionally counters PTEN's action and is over-expressed in sporadic breast cancers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that expression of these SVs is under the regulation of p53. Our observations suggest that differential expression of PTEN and its SVs could play a role in the pathogenesis of sporadic breast cancers and CS, and may lend a novel way of making a rapid molecular diagnosis of CS without mutation analysis.",1
16397222,"Endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS) represent <10% of all uterine sarcomas. Cytogenetic data on this tumor type are limited to 32 cases, and the karyotypes are often complex, but the pattern of rearrangement is nevertheless clearly nonrandom with particularly frequent involvement of chromosome arms 6p and 7p. Recently, a specific translocation t(7;17)(p15;q21) leading to the fusion of two zinc finger genes, juxtaposed with another zinc finger (JAZF1) and joined to JAZF1 (JJAZ1), was described in a subset of ESS. We present three ESS whose karyotypes were without the disease-specific t(7;17) but instead showed rearrangement of chromosomal band 6p21, twice as an unbalanced t(6p;7p) and once as a three-way 6;10;10 translocation. All three tumors showed specific rearrangement of the PHD finger protein 1 (PHF1) gene, located in chromosomal band 6p21. In the two tumors with t(6;7), PHF1 was recombined with the JAZF1 gene from 7p15, leading to the formation of a JAZF1/PHF1 fusion gene. The third tumor showed a t(6p;10q;10p) as the sole karyotypic abnormality, leading to the fusion of PHF1 with another partner, the enhancer of polycomb (EPC1) gene from 10p11; EPC1 has hitherto not been associated with neoplasia. The PHF1 gene encodes a protein with two zinc finger motifs whose involvement in tumorigenesis and/or tumor progression has not been reported before, but its rearrangement clearly defines a new pathogenetic subgroup of ESS.",1
16343267,"Eosinophilia sometimes occurs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially in core binding factor (CBF) leukemia. However, the pathogenesis of the differentiation from leukemic progenitors to eosinophils is not well understood in this type of leukemia. Recent reports showed that a novel fusion tyrosine kinase, Fip1-like1 (FIP1L1) platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha), is found in idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. The involvement of another chimeric gene, PDGFRbeta, was also reported in myeloproliferative disorder with eosinophilia. These chimeric genes cause constitutive activation of PDGFR tyrosine kinases. On the other hand, a two-hit model for the pathogenesis of AML, which seems to be caused by inactivating mutations in transcription factors and genetic lesions in tyrosine kinase resulting in constitutive activation, has been proposed. On the basis of these findings, we screened for the expression of the FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion gene and for mutations in the juxtamembrane and tyrosine kinase domains of PDGFRalpha/beta genes in 22 cases of CBF leukemia with eosinophilia. Among these cases, no FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion gene was found. Although cDNA sequencing also detected three types of single-nucleotide alterations at kinase domains in PDGFRalpha/beta genes, all of them were silent changes and polymorphisms. Therefore, PDGFRalpha/beta genes do not appear to play a significant pathogenetic role in eosinophilia or leukemogenesis of CBF leukemia.",1
16341046,"The fusion transcripts of MLL rearrangement [MLL(+)] in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and their clinicohematologic correlation have not be well characterized in the previous studies. We used Southern blot analysis to screen MLL(+) in de novo AML. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the common MLL fusion transcripts. cDNA panhandle PCR was used to identify infrequent or unknown MLL partner genes. MLL(+) was identified in 114 (98 adults) of 988 AML patients. MLL fusion transcripts comprised of 63 partial tandem duplication of MLL (MLL-PTD), 14 MLL-AF9, 9 MLL-AF10, 9 MLL-ELL, 8 MLL-AF6, 4 MLL-ENL and one each of MLL-AF1, MLL-AF4, MLL-MSF, MLL-LCX, MLL-LARG, MLL-SEPT6 and MLL-CBL. The frequency of MLL-PTD was 7.1% in adults and 0.9% in children (P<0.001). 11q23 abnormalities were detected in 64% of MLL/t11q23 and in none of MLL-PTD by conventional cytogenetics. There were no differences in remission rate, event-free survival and overall survival between adult MLL-PTD and MLL/t11q23 groups. Adult patients had a significantly poorer outcome than children. The present study showed that cDNA panhandle PCR can identify all rare or novel MLL partner genes. MLL-PTD was rare in childhood AML. MLL(+) adults had a poor outcome with no difference in survival between MLL-PTD and MLL/t11q23 groups.",1
16323008,"Holoprosencephaly (HPE), the most common structural malformation of the forebrain in humans, can be detected early during pregnancy using prenatal ultrasonography . Among foetuses with a normal karyotype, 14% have mutations in the four main HPE genes (SHH, ZIC2, SIX3 and TGIF). Genomic rearrangements have now been implicated in many genetic diseases, so we hypothesized that microdeletions in the major HPE genes may also be common in HPE foetuses with severe phenotype or other associated malformations. We screened the DNA obtained from 94 HPE foetuses with a normal karyotype for the presence of microdeletions involving the four major HPE genes (SHH, ZIC2, SIX3 and TGIF). Thirteen of the foetuses had a point mutation in one of the 4 genes and 81 had no known mutations. Quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments (QMPSF) analysis was used for rapid determination of HPE genes copy numbers and the identified microdeletions were confirmed by real time quantitative PCR, or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) (if a cell line was available). Microdeletions were detected in 8 of 94 foetuses (8.5%) (2 in SHH, 2 in SIX3, 3 in ZIC2 and 1 in TGIF genes), and only among the 81 foetuses with a normal karyotype and no point mutations. These data suggest that microdeletions in the four main HPE genes are a common cause of prenatal HPE, as well as point mutations, and increase the total diagnosis rate close to approximately 22.3% of foetuses with normal karyotype. Detection can be achieved by the QMPSF testing method that proved to be efficient for testing several genes in a single assay.",1
16322209,"The phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) pathway is activated in many human cancers. In addition to inactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, mutations or amplifications of the catalytic subunit alpha of PI3K (PIK3CA) have been reported. However, the coexistence of mutations in these two genes seems exceedingly rare. As PTEN mutations occur at high frequency in endometrial carcinoma, we screened 66 primary endometrial carcinomas for mutations in the helical and catalytic domains of PIK3CA. We identified a total of 24 (36%) mutations in this gene and coexistence of PIK3CA/PTEN mutations at high frequency (26%). PIK3CA mutations were more common in tumors with PTEN mutations (17 of 37, 46%) compared with those without PTEN mutations (7 of 29, 24%). Array comparative genomic hybridization detected 3q24-qter amplification, which covers the PIK3CA gene (3q26.3), in one of nine tumors. Knocking down PTEN expression in the HEC-1B cell line, which possesses both K-Ras and PIK3CA mutations, further enhances phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473), indicating that double mutation of PIK3CA and PTEN has an additive effect on PI3K activation. Our data suggest that the PI3K pathway is extensively activated in endometrial carcinomas, and that combination of PIK3CA/PTEN alterations might play an important role in development of these tumors.",1
16307727,"Transfer-RNA genes in archaea often have introns intervening between exon sequences. The structural motif at the boundary between exon and intron is the bulge-helix-bulge. Computational investigations of these boundary structures in Haloarcula marismortui lead us to propose that tRNA-isoleucine and tRNA-tryptophan genes are co-located. Precise in silico identification of the splice-sites on the bulges at the exon-intron boundaries lead us to infer that a single intron-containing composite tRNA-gene can give rise to more than one gene product.",0
16299586,"Microbial genes that are ""novel"" (no detectable homologs in other species) have become of increasing interest as environmental sampling suggests that there are many more such novel genes in yet-to-be-cultured microorganisms. By analyzing known microbial genomic islands and prophages, we developed criteria for systematic identification of putative genomic islands (clusters of genes of probable horizontal origin in a prokaryotic genome) in 63 prokaryotic genomes, and then characterized the distribution of novel genes and other features. All but a few of the genomes examined contained significantly higher proportions of novel genes in their predicted genomic islands compared with the rest of their genome (Paired t test = 4.43E-14 to 1.27E-18, depending on method). Moreover, the reverse observation (i.e., higher proportions of novel genes outside of islands) never reached statistical significance in any organism examined. We show that this higher proportion of novel genes in predicted genomic islands is not due to less accurate gene prediction in genomic island regions, but likely reflects a genuine increase in novel genes in these regions for both bacteria and archaea. This represents the first comprehensive analysis of novel genes in prokaryotic genomic islands and provides clues regarding the origin of novel genes. Our collective results imply that there are different gene pools associated with recently horizontally transmitted genomic regions versus regions that are primarily vertically inherited. Moreover, there are more novel genes within the gene pool associated with genomic islands. Since genomic islands are frequently associated with a particular microbial adaptation, such as antibiotic resistance, pathogen virulence, or metal resistance, this suggests that microbes may have access to a larger ""arsenal"" of novel genes for adaptation than previously thought.",0
16294026,"Previous studies have shown that Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of c-KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), is highly effective in c-KIT/CD117-positive gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), especially in those having activating mutations in c-kit exon 11. In addition, gain-of-function mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (exon 12) and the kinase activation loop (exon 18) of PDGFRalpha were found in GISTs. Importantly, the presence and type of these mutually exclusive c-KIT or PDGFRalpha mutations were found to be associated with the response to imatinib. Here, we examined the prevalence of c-kit exon 11 and PDGFRalpha exons 12 and 18 mutations in other tumor types known to express these tyrosine kinase receptors in order to explore which other cancer types may potentially benefit from imatinib treatment. We determined the mutational status of these commonly mutated exons by direct sequencing in 11 different tumor types (in total: 215 unrelated cases), including GIST, chordoma, and various distinct tumors of lung, brain and its coverings, and skin cancer. Of the 579 exons examined (211 c-kit exon 11, 192 PDGFRalpha exon 12, 142 PDGFRalpha exon18, 17 PDGFRbeta exon 12 and 17 PDGFRbeta exon 18), only 12 (all GIST) harbored mutations (10 c-kit exon 11 and 2 PDGFRalpha exon18). From these data we conclude that activating c-KIT and PDGFR mutations are sporadic in human cancers known to overexpress these tyrosine kinase receptor genes and suggest that, except in GIST, this overexpression is not correlated with activating mutations. The latter may imply that these wild-type c-KIT and PDGFR tumor types will probably not benefit from imatinib treatment.",1
16289058,"Multivariate analyses are often used to identify major trends of variation in synonymous codon usage among genes. These analyses need to be performed on properly normalized codon usage data to avoid biases masking this synonymous variation, i.e., gene length, amino acid usage, and codon degeneracy; however, previous studies have failed to do so. In this paper, we demonstrate that the use of alternative normalized data (called 'relative adaptiveness' in the literature) can avoid all these biases and furthermore, can identify more trends of variation among genes, including GC-ending codon usage, GT-ending codon usage, and gene expression level.",0
16260106,"In a case of suicidal application of electricity differences between the rectal temperature of the body and the suspected time of death were observed. In order to answer the question whether an electric current from hand to hand over >30 min led to a rise in body temperature FEM-based computer simulations and animal experiments were carried out. Both resulted in a warming of the soft parts in the arm without warming the body core. Thus a temperature-based estimation of the time since death can also be used in cases with electricity as the cause of death. Besides, in the animal experiment we found a spontaneous rise in the body core temperature even without application of electricity which may be a reason for the typical temperature plateau after death.",0
16259108,"The molecular mechanisms involved in the development and progression of laryngeal cancer, specifically squamous cell carcinoma, still need further investigation and elucidation. Twenty-two laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas were analyzed in our study regarding genetic changes of two tumor suppressor genes: Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and E-cadherin (CDH1). APC gene instability was tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. The samples were also screened for mutations using the heteroduplex method. E-cadherin gene was analyzed by PCR amplification of tetranucleotide marker (D16S752) linked to E-cadherin gene. The results of our analysis showed three samples with LOH of the APC gene out of 15 heterozygous patients (20%). Only one LOH of the CDH1 gene (5.5%) out of 18 heterozygous patients was discovered. D16S752 marker did not reveal any replication error-positive samples. There were six samples showing heteroduplexes (33%) encompassed in APC's exon 11. Altogether, nine samples (41%) showed alterations of the APC gene. Our results suggest that alterations of APC gene may have a role in squamous cell carcinoma development. Detected LOH of the E-cadherin gene indicates that genetic changes of this gene are not very frequent, but that other components of the wnt signaling cascade may also be involved.",1
16235153,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether TSHr antibody negative Graves' disease is associated with somatic mutations in the TSHr or Gsalpha genes and whether histopathologically defined thyroid lesions, i.e., hyperfunctioning adenoma, non-functioning follicular adenomas, or nodules in toxic and non-toxic multinodular goiters are associated with such mutations. No mutations but three germ-line polymorphisms were found in patients with TSHr antibody negative Graves' disease. The three polymorphisms are expected to have no or only minor effects on the signaling properties, and is not associated with altered antigenecity imposed by such mutations. Two heterozygous somatic TSHr mutations were found in two hyperfunctioning adenomas and in two toxic multinodular goiters. The lack of TSHr and Gsalpha mutations in TSHr antibody negative Graves' disease patients indicates that such mutations are neither primary nor secondary events in this disease. The results also confirm that somatic gain-of-function TSHr mutations are present in hyperfunctioning follicular adenomas and goiters, but not in non-functioning thyroid lesions.",1
16224024,"Tourette's syndrome (TS) is a genetically influenced developmental neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by chronic vocal and motor tics. We studied Slit and Trk-like 1 (SLITRK1) as a candidate gene on chromosome 13q31.1 because of its proximity to a de novo chromosomal inversion in a child with TS. Among 174 unrelated probands, we identified a frameshift mutation and two independent occurrences of the identical variant in the binding site for microRNA hsa-miR-189. These variants were absent from 3600 control chromosomes. SLITRK1 mRNA and hsa-miR-189 showed an overlapping expression pattern in brain regions previously implicated in TS. Wild-type SLITRK1, but not the frameshift mutant, enhanced dendritic growth in primary neuronal cultures. Collectively, these findings support the association of rare SLITRK1 sequence variants with TS.",1
16219788,"Most models of positive directional selection assume codominance of the beneficial allele. We examine the importance of this assumption by implementing a coalescent model of positive directional selection with arbitrary dominance. We find that, for a given mean fixation time, a beneficial allele has a much weaker effect on diversity at linked neutral sites when the allele is recessive.",0
16170316,"Costello syndrome is a multiple congenital anomaly and mental retardation syndrome characterized by coarse face, loose skin, cardiomyopathy and predisposition to tumors. We identified four heterozygous de novo mutations of HRAS in 12 of 13 affected individuals, all of which were previously reported as somatic and oncogenic mutations in various tumors. Our observations suggest that germline mutations in HRAS perturb human development and increase susceptibility to tumors.",1
16161041,"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a neoplasm composed of myofibroblastic spindle cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells. Cytogenetic analyses have revealed that a subgroup of IMT, in particular among children and young adults, harbors clonal chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome band 2p23. Further, molecular genetic studies have shown that these rearrangements target the ALK gene, serving as the 3'-partner in fusion genes with various translocation partners. In the present study, we describe the finding of a novel SEC31L1/ALK fusion gene in an intraabdominal IMT of a young man. G-band analysis revealed a translocation t(2;4)(p23;q21) and subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridization with locus-specific probes strongly indicated disruption of the ALK locus on chromosome 2. Immunostaining with monoclonal mouse anti-human CD246 ALK Protein showed diffuse cytoplasmic positivity. Using reverse primers for the ALK-gene, we could, by 5'-RACE methodology, amplify a single 1.2 kb fragment. Sequence analysis showed that the fragment was a hybrid cDNA product in which nt 3012 of SEC31L1 (NM_016211), located in band 4q21, was fused in-frame to nt 4080 of ALK (NM_004304). RT-PCR with two sets of primer pairs specific for SEC31L1 and ALK amplified two transcripts, which at sequencing corresponded to two types of chimeric SEC31L1/ALK transcripts. In the long, type I, transcript nt 3012 of SEC31L1 (NM_016211) was fused in-frame to nt 4080 of ALK. In the short, type II, transcript nt 2670 of SEC31L1 was fused in-frame to nt 4080 of ALK. Genomic PCR and subsequent sequencing showed that the breakpoints were located in intron 23 of SEC31L1 and intron 20 of ALK.",1
16160692,"Much of what we know about the chromatin-based mechanisms that regulate gene expression in mammals has come from the study of what are, paradoxically, atypical genes. These are clusters of structurally and/or functionally related genes that are coordinately regulated during development, or between different cell types. Can unravelling the mechanisms of gene regulation at these gene clusters help us to understand how other genes are controlled? Moreover, can it explain why there is clustering of apparently unrelated genes in mammalian genomes?",0
16155567,"The nature of synthetic genetic interactions involving essential genes (those required for viability) has not been previously examined in a broad and unbiased manner. We crossed yeast strains carrying promoter-replacement alleles for more than half of all essential yeast genes to a panel of 30 different mutants with defects in diverse cellular processes. The resulting genetic network is biased toward interactions between functionally related genes, enabling identification of a previously uncharacterized essential gene (PGA1) required for specific functions of the endoplasmic reticulum. But there are also many interactions between genes with dissimilar functions, suggesting that individual essential genes are required for buffering many cellular processes. The most notable feature of the essential synthetic genetic network is that it has an interaction density five times that of nonessential synthetic genetic networks, indicating that most yeast genetic interactions involve at least one essential gene.",0
16153168,"Genome trees are a means to capture the overwhelming amount of phylogenetic information that is present in genomes. Different formalisms have been introduced to reconstruct genome trees on the basis of various aspects of the genome. On the basis of these aspects, we separate genome trees into five classes: (a) alignment-free trees based on statistic properties of the genome, (b) gene content trees based on the presence and absence of genes, (c) trees based on chromosomal gene order, (d) trees based on average sequence similarity, and (e) phylogenomics-based genome trees. Despite their recent development, genome tree methods have already had some impact on the phylogenetic classification of bacterial species. However, their main impact so far has been on our understanding of the nature of genome evolution and the role of horizontal gene transfer therein. An ideal genome tree method should be capable of using all gene families, including those containing paralogs, in a phylogenomics framework capitalizing on existing methods in conventional phylogenetic reconstruction. We expect such sophisticated methods to help us resolve the branching order between the main bacterial phyla.",0
16142313,"The mechanisms of carcinogenesis in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) are not well characterized although alterations in several oncogenes and onco-suppressor genes have been reported to occur in ICC. In the present study, we focused on alterations in the Wnt signaling components and target genes by analyzing 24 surgically resected samples of ICC. Immunohistochemical analysis of beta-catenin showed positive staining in cytoplasm and/or nucleus in 58.3% of the samples, indicating the presence of alterations in the Wnt signaling pathway in these samples. In sequencing analyses, mutations in the beta-catenin, adenomatous polyposis coli and Axin 1 genes were observed in 8.3, 12.5 and 41.7%, respectively, of the 24 ICC samples; however, the functional significance of these mutated genes is controversial. Furthermore, cyclin D1, c-myc and urinary-type plasminogen activator receptor, which are the downstream target genes in the Wnt signaling pathway, were overexpressed in 41.7, 41.7 and 58.3%, respectively, of the 24 ICC samples. The overexpression of cyclin D1 was statistically correlated with that of beta-catenin. Based on these results, we speculated that the Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in carcinogenesis in ICC through overexpression of its target genes, particularly cyclin D1.",1
16118479,"Closure of the materials recycle loop for water-foods-oxygen is the primary purpose of space agriculture on Mars and Moon. A microbial ecological system takes a part of agriculture to process our metabolic excreta and inedible biomass and convert them to nutrients and soil substrate for cultivating plants. If we extend the purpose of space agriculture to the creation and control of a healthy and pleasant living environment, we should realize that our human body should not be sterilized but exposed to the appropriate microbial environment. We are proposing a use of hyper-thermophilic aerobic composting microbial ecology in space agriculture. Japan has a broad historical and cultural background on this subject. There had been agriculture that drove a closed loop of materials between consuming cities and farming villages in vicinity. Recent environmental problems regarding garbage collection and processing in towns have motivated home electronics companies to innovate ""garbage composting"" machines with bacterial technology. Based on those matured technology, together with new insights on microbiology and microbial ecology, we have been developing a conceptual design of space agriculture on Moon and Mars. There are several issues to be answered in order to prove effectiveness of the use of microbial systems in space. 1) Can the recycled nutrients, processed by the hyper-thermal aerobic composting microbial ecology, be formed in the physical and chemical state or configuration, with which plants can uptake those nutrients? A possibility of removing any major components of fertilizer from its recycle loop is another item to be evaluated. 2) What are the merits of forming soil microbial ecology around the root system of plants? This might be the most crucial question. Recent researches exhibit various mutually beneficial relationships among soil microbiota and plants, and symbiotic ecology in composting bacteria. It is essential to understand those features, and define how to conduct preventive maintenance for keeping cultivating soil healthy and productive. 3) Does microbial ecology contribute to building sustainable and expandable human habitation by utilizing the on site extraterrestrial resources? We are assessing technical feasibility of converting regolith to farming soil and structural materials for space agriculture. In the case of Mars habitation, carbon dioxide and a trace amount of nitrogen in atmosphere, and potassium and phosphor in minerals are the sources we consider. Excess oxygen can be accumulated by woods cultivation and their use for lumber. 4) Is the operation of space agriculture robust and safe, if it adopts hyper-thermophilic aerobic microbial ecology? Any ecological system is complex and non-linear, and shows latency and memory effects in its response. It is highly important to understand those features to design and operate space agriculture without falling into the fatal failure. Assessment should be made on the microbial safety and preparation of the preventive measures to eliminate negative elements that would either retard agricultural production or harm the healthy environment. It is worth to mention that such space agriculture would be an effective engineering testbed to solve the global problem on energy and environment. Mars and Moon exploration itself is a good advocate of healthy curiosity expressed by the sustainable civilization of our humankind. We propose to work together towards Mars and Moon with microbial ecology to assure pleasant habitation there.",0
16102578,"We have developed a simple analytical method that increases the efficiency of identifying mutant genes in cell lines after the inhibition of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). The approach assumes that the spectra of mutant genes differ between cell lines of the same tumor origin. Thus, by analyzing more than one cell line in parallel and taking into account not only changes in mRNA levels after the inhibition of NMD, but also comparing mRNA levels between cell lines before the inhibition of NMD, the vast majority of false positives were eliminated from the analysis. In this study, we used Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays to compare mRNA profiles of two prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and LNCaP, before and after emetine treatment. As a result of our modified approach, from the 14,500 genes present on the array, 7 were identified as candidates from LNCaP cells and 1 was identified from PC3 cells. Sequence analysis of five of these candidate genes identified gene-inactivating mutations in four of them. Homozygous mutations were found in the synaptojanin 2 (SYNJ2) and the cleft lip and palate CLPTM1 genes. Two different heterozygous mutations in the Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) gene result in complete loss of the protein in several different prostate cancer cell lines.",1
16078053,"Premature ovarian failure (POF) is the occurrence of menopause before the age of 40 and affects 1% of the female population. Whereas the etiology of POF is largely unexplained, FMR1 premutation carriers are known to be at increased risk of POF compared with the general population. The FMR1 premutation alleles have 55-200 copies of a CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. However, functional effects on gene expression may occur even for repeat sizes in what has been considered the ""normal"" range. To evaluate the role of the FMR1 repeat in POF, repeat sizes were examined in 53 women with idiopathic POF, 161 control women from the general population, and 21 women with proven fertility at an advanced maternal age. A significant increase in the number of FMR1 alleles between and including 35 and 54 CGG repeats was found in the POF patient population; 15 of 106 (14.2%) POF alleles were between and including 35 and 54 repeats, whereas only 21 of 322 (6.5%) alleles in the general population (P=0.02) and 2 of 42 (4.8%) alleles from women with proven late fertility (P=0.09) were of this size (P=0.01 versus combined controls). The effect was also significant for comparisons of genotype repeat size (repeat size weighted by the relative activity of the two FMR1 alleles) and biallelic mean (average size of the two alleles). These results are clinically relevant and suggest that the FMR1 gene plays a more significant role in the incidence of POF than has previously been thought.",1
16077965,"Using PCR-SSCP screening and direct sequencing we analyzed a series of 28 colorectal carcinomas for mutations in p53 (exons 5-8) and Ki-ras (codons 12, 13 and 61), and for micro-satellite instability (MSI) at BAT25 and BAT26, supplementing data with the analysis of the IARC colorectal cancer p53 mutation database. Mutations were correlated with the site of tumor origin (proximal or distal to the splenic flexure). We identified 19 mutations in p53, 9 in Ki-ras, and 4 MSI-positive cases in a total of 20 tumors. Only 6/20 cases (30%) carried mutations in both p53 and Ki-ras. Mutations in p53 were detected at similar frequencies in proximal and distal tumors, while IARC data pointed to a strong association of p53 mutations with distal cancers. Ki-ras mutations were more frequent in proximal tumors, and MSI occurred at similar frequencies in proximal and distal tumors and was associated with mutations in p53 or Ki-ras. The p53 mutations detected in the series analyzed, as well as those retrieved from the IARC database, were predominantly transitions, with no preferential sequence localization or nucleotide position. Ki-ras mutations were predominantly transversions in position 2 at codon 12. MSI-H occurred at similar frequencies in proximal and distal tumors and was associated with either p53 or Ki-ras mutations. Overall these data suggest that distinct mutagenic factors target p53 and Ki-ras in colorectal epithelium irrespective of MSI-H status.",1

16039986,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules playing regulatory roles in animals and plants by repressing translation or cleaving RNA transcripts. The specific modulation of several microRNAs has been recently associated to some forms of human cancer, suggesting that these short molecules may represent a new class of genes involved in oncogenesis. In our study, we examined by microarray the global expression levels of 245 microRNAs in glioblastoma multiforme, the most frequent and malignant of primary brain tumors. The analysis of both glioblastoma tissues and glioblastoma cell lines allowed us to identify a group of microRNAs whose expression is significantly altered in this tumor. The most interesting results came from miR-221, strongly up-regulated in glioblastoma and from a set of brain-enriched miRNAs, miR-128, miR-181a, miR-181b, and miR-181c, which are down-regulated in glioblastoma.",1

In most cases, their basic design allows the cloning of a single target gene, typically under a specific promoter, in parallel with the expression of selection and/or marker genes from the same vector. However, new and versatile systems now exist that expand the user's choice to a large number of promoters and terminators, and various autofluorescent tags confer the ability to express multiple genes from a single transformation vector.",0
15987602,"Although the antiestrogen agent tamoxifen has long been used to treat women with hormone receptor positive invasive breast carcinoma, the mechanisms of its action and acquired resistance to tamoxifen during treatment are largely unknown. A number of studies have revealed that over-activation of some signaling pathways can cause tamoxifen resistance; however, very little information is available regarding the genes whose loss-of-function alternation contribute to tamoxifen resistance. Here we used a forward genetic approach in vitro to generate tamoxifen resistant cells from the tamoxifen sensitive breast cancer cell line ZR-75-1, and further identified the disrupted gene in different tamoxifen resistant clones. Retinol binding protein 7, DNA polymerase-transactivated protein 3, g-glutamyltransferase-like activity 1, slit-robo RhoGTPase-activating protein, tetraspan NET-4, HSPC194, amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel gene, and Notch2, were the eight mutated genes identified in different tamoxifen resistant clones, suggesting their requirement for tamoxifen sensitivity in ZR-75-1 cells. Since the functions of these genes are not related to each other, it suggests that multiple pathways can influence tamoxifen sensitivity in breast cancer cells.",1

15973414,"Most sporadic colorectal cancers are initiated by activating Wnt pathway mutations, characterized by the stabilization of beta-catenin and constitutive transcription by the beta-catenin/T cell factor-4 (Tcf-4) complex. EphB guidance receptors are Tcf4 target genes that control intestinal epithelial architecture through repulsive interactions with Ephrin-B ligands. Here we show that, although Wnt signalling remains constitutively active, most human colorectal cancers lose expression of EphB at the adenoma-carcinoma transition. Loss of EphB expression strongly correlates with degree of malignancy. Furthermore, reduction of EphB activity accelerates tumorigenesis in the colon and rectum of Apc(Min/+) mice, and results in the formation of aggressive adenocarcinomas. Our data demonstrate that loss of EphB expression represents a critical step in colorectal cancer progression.",1

15943206,"The American and Russian/Soviet space programs independently uncovered psychosocial risks inherent in long-duration space missions. Now that these two countries are working together on the International Space Station (ISS), American-Russian cultural differences pose an additional set of risk factors. These may echo cultural differences that have been observed in the general population of the two countries and in space analogue settings, but little is known about how relevant these are to the select population of space program personnel. The evidence for the existence of mission-relevant cultural differences is reviewed and includes cultural values, emotional expressivity, personal space norms, and personality characteristics. The review is focused primarily on Russia and the United States, but also includes other ISS partner countries. Cultural differences among space program personnel may have a wide range of effects. Moreover, culture-related strains may increase the probability of distress and impairment. Such factors could affect the individual and interpersonal functioning of both crewmembers and mission control personnel, whose performance is also critical for mission safety and success. Examples from the anecdotal and empirical literature are given to illustrate these points. The use of existing assessment strategies runs the risk of overlooking important early warning signs of behavioral health difficulties. By paying more attention to cultural differences and how they might be manifested, we are more likely to detect problems early while they are still mild and resolvable.",0
15943205,"Anecdotal reports from space and results from space analogue experiments on Earth have suggested a number of interpersonal issues that may negatively affect crewmember performance and well-being. We examined some of these issues in a questionnaire survey of 54 astronauts and cosmonauts who had flown in space and in a 135-d Mir Space Station simulation study in Moscow. We also conducted a NASA-funded study involving missions to the Mir Space Station, where 5 U.S. astronauts, 8 Russian cosmonauts, and 42 U.S. and 16 Russian mission control subjects completed weekly mood and group climate questionnaires. There were few findings that supported hypothesized changes in tension and group behavior in terms of time on-orbit. Crewmembers reported decreasing leader support in the second half of their mission, and U.S. astronauts gave evidence for a novelty effect in the first few weeks. There was strong support for our hypothesized displacement of tension and negative emotions from crewmembers to mission control personnel and from mission control personnel to management. There were several significant differences in response between Americans vs. Russians and crewmembers vs. mission control personnel. These findings have training countermeasure implications for future on-orbit space missions. During expeditionary type space missions, such as a trip to Mars, additional interpersonal stressors will need to be dealt with. These include increased crew autonomy, more dependence on onboard technical resources, communication delays with the Earth, increased isolation and monotony, and the Earth-out-of-view phenomenon.",0
15943202,"Maintaining optimal alertness and neurobehavioral functioning during space operations is critical to enable the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) vision ""to extend humanity's reach to the Moon, Mars and beyond"" to become a reality. Field data have demonstrated that sleep times and performance of crewmembers can be compromised by extended duty days, irregular work schedules, high workload, and varying environmental factors. This paper documents evidence of significant sleep loss and disruption of circadian rhythms in astronauts and associated performance decrements during several space missions, which demonstrates the need to develop effective countermeasures. Both sleep and circadian disruptions have been identified in the Behavioral Health and Performance (BH&P) area and the Advanced Human Support Technology (AHST) area of NASA's Bioastronautics Critical Path Roadmap. Such disruptions could have serious consequences on the effectiveness, health, and safety of astronaut crews, thus reducing the safety margin and increasing the chances of an accident or incident. These decrements oftentimes can be difficult to detect and counter effectively in restrictive operational environments. NASA is focusing research on the development of optimal sleep/wake schedules and countermeasure timing and application to help mitigate the cumulative effects of sleep and circadian disruption and enhance operational performance. Investing research in humans is one of NASA's building blocks that will allow for both short- and long-duration space missions and help NASA in developing approaches to manage and overcome the human limitations of space travel. In addition to reviewing the current state of knowledge concerning sleep and circadian disruptions during space operations, this paper provides an overview of NASA's broad research goals. Also, NASA-funded research, designed to evaluate the relationships between sleep quality, circadian rhythm stability, and performance proficiency in both ground-based simulations and space mission studies, as described in the 2003 NASA Task Book, will be reviewed.",0
15943192,"This paper presents a brief history of psychology and psychiatry roles in psychological selection and how these roles have evolved into the Behavioral Sciences Branch at the Johnson Space Center USC), Houston, TX. Since the initial selection of the Mercury Seven, the first United States astronauts, psychologists and psychiatrists have been involved in astronaut selection activities. Initially very involved in psychological selection of astronauts, the role of behavioral health specialists waned during the Gemini and Apollo years. With the onset of the NASA/Mir/International Space Station Program, the introduction of payload and mission specialists, and international collaboration, the evolving need for behavioral health expertise became apparent. Medical and psychological selection processes were revisited and the Johnson Space Center developed a separate operational unit focused on behavioral health and performance. This work unit eventually became the Behavioral Sciences branch of the Space Medicine and Health Care Systems Office. Research was allocated across groups at JSC, other NASA space centers, and the National Space Biomedical Research Institute, and was funded by NASA Headquarters. The current NASA focus on human space exploration to the Moon and beyond re-emphasizes the importance of the human-centered approach.",0
15943041,"In the present study, the expression of P53 and MDM2 proteins were examined in specimens from a group of 20 patients (9 with primary hepatocellular carcinoma HCC and 11 with liver cirrhosis LC, linked to HBV infections as a major aetiologic factor) by immunohistochemistry. The immunostaining findings were correlated with P53 mutation analysis using PCR-SSCP, PCR-HDF and direct sequencing, and MDM2 amplification studies by differential PCR. P53 immunopositivity was found in 9 out of the 20 (45.0%) cases. Mutations of the P53 gene were detected in 5 (55%) tumors and 3 (27%) LC samples; 7 of these cases revealed P53 immunoreactivity. The mutations were base transitions at codons 175, 245 and 273; no changes were observed at codon 249, characteristic for aflatoxins action. MDM2 immunopositivity was revealed in 9 out of 20 (45.0%) specimens. MDM2 amplification occurred in 4 (44.4%) and 1 (9.1%) cases, HCC and LC specimens respectively; only in 2 tumors (10.0%), which exhibited MDM2 immunoreactivity. Overall, MDM2 positivity was not associated with MDM2 amplification in 7 out of the 20 studied samples (35.0%). Two HCC patients were found to have both gene abnormalities. Either the mutation rate of the P53 gene as well as the amplification level of the MDM2 gene was higher in HCC than in precancerous liver tissue stages. These results support the notion that besides P53 alterations, MDM2 gene deregulation seems to be an important event in hepatocarcinogenesis. Additionally, the mechanism of MDM2-mediated degradation of P53 protein, without involving stabilization and inactivation of P53 gene, should be considered for the understanding of all features of tumor progression processes.",1
15930127,"Volatile anesthetics including isoflurane affect all cells examined, but their mechanisms of action remain unknown. To investigate the cellular basis of anesthetic action, we are studying Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants altered in their response to anesthetics. The zzz3-1 mutation renders yeast isoflurane resistant and is an allele of GCN3. Gcn3p functions in the evolutionarily conserved general amino acid control (GCN) pathway that regulates protein synthesis and gene expression in response to nutrient availability through phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha). Hyperphosphorylation of eIF2alpha inhibits translation initiation during amino acid starvation. Isoflurane rapidly (in <15 min) inhibits yeast cell division and amino acid uptake. Unexpectedly, phosphorylation of eIF2alpha decreased dramatically upon initial exposure although hyperphosphorylation occurred later. Translation initiation was inhibited by isoflurane even when eIF2alpha phosphorylation decreased and this inhibition was GCN-independent. Maintenance of inhibition required GCN-dependent hyperphosphorylation of eIF2alpha. Thus, two nutrient-sensitive stages displaying unique features promote isoflurane-induced inhibition of translation initiation. The rapid phase is GCN-independent and apparently has not been recognized previously. The maintenance phase is GCN-dependent and requires inhibition of general translation imparted by enhanced eIF2alpha phosphorylation. Surprisingly, as shown here, the transcription activator Gcn4p does not affect anesthetic response.",0
15925546,"This article reports on the construction and analysis in vitro and in vivo of novel gene switches that can be used to achieve spatial as well as temporal control over the expression of a transgene of interest. The switches are expected to be functional in virtually any tissue and cell type. They consist of (a) a foreign or modified transactivator expressed under the dual control of a promoter or promoter cassette that is responsive to heat and the transactivator and (b) a promoter responsive to the transactivator for controlling the transgene of interest. A preferred gene switch of this type incorporated a mifepristone-dependent transactivator. This gene switch could be activated by a transient heat treatment in the presence of mifepristone. Activity increased with the intensity of the activating heat treatment and was found to persist for more than 6 days. The gene switch was essentially inactive prior to an activating heat treatment, in the absence or presence of mifepristone. Activated gene switch could be silenced by removal/withdrawal of mifepristone.",0
15923623,"Siamois is the transcriptional mediator of the dorsal Wnt signaling pathway and is necessary for formation of the Spemann organizer and dorsoanterior development in Xenopus. We have determined that XIC, a Xenopus I-mfa domain protein that regulates Tcf3 binding, is required for dorsoaxial development and specifically for Siamois activity in establishing the dorsal organizer. In loss-of-function studies, we found that embryos injected with a morpholino to XIC mRNA (XIC morphpolino) are missing head structures, neural tube, notochord, and paraxial mesoderm as well as NCAM and XMyoD expression. Although Siamois, Twin, and Xnr3 expression is normal in morpholino-injected embryos, levels of downstream organizer factors, including goosecoid, Xnot, Cerberus, and chordin, are severely reduced. Ectopic axis formation induced by Siamois is repressed by injection of the XIC morpholino and further repressed by coinjection of beta-catenin or a constitutively active Tcf3/HMG/G4A fusion. Activation of reporters driven by the Siamois-responsive proximal element of the goosecoid promoter is inhibited in the presence of the morpholino and can be rescued by murine I-mfa and by a dominant-negative Tcf3. The data indicate a role for XIC in limiting Tcf3-dependent repression of Siamois activities that are required for goosecoid transcription and for dorsal organizer formation.",1

15822193,"The influence of drug-drug and drug-food interactions affecting the absorption of orally administered medication is reviewed. Drug-drug interactions can be classified in terms of indirect effects by one drug on gastrointestinal tract physiology influencing the absorption of other drugs, or direct interactions involving altered pH, adsorption, absorption, or chelation. Most, but not all, drug-drug interactions result in reduced or delayed systemic drug availability. Drug-food interactions may result in reduced, delayed, or increased systemic drug availability. The absorption of only a small number of drugs is unaffected by concomitant food intake. The degree of interaction and whether it positively or negatively affects drug absorption depends on a number of factors including the physical and chemical nature of the drug, the formulation, the type of meal, and the time interval between eating and dosing. Mechanisms of drug-food interactions are not well characterised. They clearly involve both direct and indirect factors in a similar fashion to drug-drug interactions, but indirect factors probably predominate. Reduced or delayed drug absorption is generally attributed, at least in part, to delayed stomach-emptying due to food. Increased absorption may also result from delayed stomach-emptying facilitating greater drug dissolution before it passes from the stomach into the small intestine. Increased bioavailability of some drugs, e.g. propranolol, metoprolol and labetalol, may be related to reduced presystemic clearance. The potential clinical implications of drug-drug and drug-food interactions must be taken into account with oral medications in order to minimise variations in systemic drug availability and hence in clinical efficacy.",0

15814024,"Understanding the mechanisms that govern the expression of genomes is one of the major challenges of the post-genomic era. Phylogenetic footprinting, which identifies genomic regions under evolutionary constraints, has proven helpful in finding cis-regulatory elements of transcription; however, this method may not be applicable across all evolutionary distances and for all types of genes. Recent results from vertebrate comparisons indicate that strong conservation of cis-regulatory regions may occur more frequently in developmental regulator genes. This paper reviews methods of identifying conserved regulatory elements of developmental genes by comparative genomics, including new attempts to detect conserved features beyond simple sequence similarities. The results obtained are outlined and the authors comment on their functional and evolutionary implications. Finally, an evaluation of currently available methods of characterising the function of presumed conserved regulatory regions is presented, and problems such as promoter compatibility, assigning distant elements to their cognate genes and multifunctionality of elements, discussed.",0

15802535,"Although the zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP-70) is overexpressed in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) displaying unmutated IGVH genes and poor prognosis, a previous microarray study from our group identified overexpression of LPL and ADAM29 genes among unmutated and mutated CLL, respectively. To assess the prognostic value of these genes, we quantified their expression by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a cohort of 127 patients with CLL and correlated this with clinical outcome, IGVH mutational status, and ZAP-70 protein expression. IGVH mutational status, ZAP-70, and the LPL and ADAM29 mRNA ratios (L/A ratio) were predictive of event-free survival for the whole cohort and for patients with stage A disease. In patients in stage B and C, the L/A ratio was an independent prognostic factor, whereas ZAP-70 did not predict survival. Simultaneous usage of the L/A ratio and ZAP-70 expression allowed an almost perfect (99%) assessment of the IGVH status in the 80% of patients with concordant results (L/A+, ZAP-70+ or L/A-, ZAP-70-). LPL and ADAM29 gene expression could also be determined by a simple competitive multiplex reverse transcription PCR assay. Overall, quantification of LPL and ADAM29 gene expression is a strong prognostic indicator in CLL, providing better prognostic assessment than ZAP-70 in advanced stages of the disease.",1
15796961,"Loss of heterozygosity at 10q26 was mapped using microsatellite markers in 20 osteosarcomas. A four-megabase region centered on marker D10S587 was affected by allelic loss in 60 percent of osteosarcomas. The most frequently lost marker was D10S1723. Around 15 known genes are found in this region. The gene immediately adjacent to D10S1723 encodes BUB3, an element of the spindle assembly mitotic checkpoint. Loss of BUB3 function could contribute to chromosomal instability. The fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene is located 2 Mb from the BUB3 gene and has the potential for a role in cancer. Inherited mutations of the FGFR2 gene result in skeletal dysplasias. FGFR2 alterations have also been implicated in gastric cancer. Human genome project data were used to design primers for amplifying FGFR2 in 18 genomic segments and BUB3 in 7 genomic segments. In each case, the segments encompassed coding exons and flanking intron sequences. The primers were used to search for mutations by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). Several shifted bands were detected in the BUB3 exon 3 fragment. Sequencing resolved the BUB3 exon 3 fragment shifts into polymorphisms in intron 2. No mutations of BUB3 or FGFR2 were detected. It remains possible that BUB3 or FGFR2 hemizygosity alone contributes to osteosarcoma, or that one of the genes is cryptically inactivated by a higher-order modification or mutation outside the coding region. There may also be a yet undiscovered tumor suppressor gene in this region.",1
15772095,"McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by post-axial polydactyly, congenital heart defects and hydrometrocolpos, a congenital structural abnormality of female genitalia. Mutations in the MKKS gene have also been shown to cause some cases of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) which is characterized by obesity, pigmentary retinopathy, polydactyly, renal abnormalities and hypogenitalism with secondary features of hypertension and diabetes. Although there is overlap in clinical features between MKS and BBS, MKS patients are not obese and do not develop retinopathy or have learning disabilities. To further explore the pathophysiology of BBS and the related disorder MKS, we have developed an Mkks(-/-) mouse model. This model shows that the absence of Mkks leads to retinal degeneration through apoptosis, failure of spermatozoa flagella formation, elevated blood pressure and obesity. The obesity is associated with hyperphagia and decreased activity. In addition, neurological screening reveals deficits in olfaction and social dominance. The mice do not have polydactyly or vaginal abnormalities. The phenotype of the Mkks(-/-) mice closely resembles the phenotype of other mouse models of BBS (Bbs2(-/-) and Bbs4(-/-)). These observations suggest that the complete absence of MKKS leads to BBS while the MKS phenotype is likely to be due to specific mutations.",1
15735689,"Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABC) are locally aggressive bone tumors that often feature chromosome 17p13 rearrangements. One of the ABC 17p13 rearrangements--t(16;17)(q22;p13)--was recently shown to create a CDH11-USP6 fusion in which the USP6/TRE17 oncogene is overexpressed through juxtaposition with the CDH11 promoter. Herein, we characterize four different ABC translocations involving 17p13, and we show that each is associated with a novel USP6 fusion oncogene. Specifically, we demonstrate that t(1;17), t(3;17), t(9;17), and t(17;17) result in USP6 fusions with TRAP150 (thyroid receptor-associated protein 150), ZNF9 (ZiNc Finger 9), Osteomodulin, and COL1A1 (Collagen 1A1), respectively. The oncogenic mechanism in these fusion genes is akin to CDH11-USP6, with the USP6 coding sequences juxtaposed to the promoter regions in each of the four novel translocation partners. The novel fusion partners appear well suited to drive USP6 transcription in the bone/mesenchymal context: osteomodulin is expressed strongly in osteoblastic lineages, and the COL1A1 promoter has an oncogenic role in the mesenchymal cancer dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. In summary, these studies show that USP6 oncogenic activation results from heterogeneous genomic mechanisms involving USP6 transcriptional upregulation by juxtaposition with ectopic promoters.",1
15716310,"In recent years, the increase in the amounts of available genomic data has made it easier to appreciate the extent by which organisms increase their genetic diversity through horizontally transferred genetic material. Such transfers have the potential to give rise to extremely dynamic genomes where a significant proportion of their coding DNA has been contributed by external sources. Because of the impact of these horizontal transfers on the ecological and pathogenic character of the recipient organisms, methods are continuously sought that are able to computationally determine which of the genes of a given genome are products of transfer events. In this paper, we introduce and discuss a novel computational method for identifying horizontal transfers that relies on a gene's nucleotide composition and obviates the need for knowledge of codon boundaries. In addition to being applicable to individual genes, the method can be easily extended to the case of clusters of horizontally transferred genes. With the help of an extensive and carefully designed set of experiments on 123 archaeal and bacterial genomes, we demonstrate that the new method exhibits significant improvement in sensitivity when compared to previously published approaches. In fact, it achieves an average relative improvement across genomes of between 11 and 41% compared to the Codon Adaptation Index method in distinguishing native from foreign genes.

15565109,"Genetically modified mice have been extensively used for analyzing the molecular events that occur during tumor development. In many, if not all, cases, however, it is uncertain to what extent the mouse models reproduce features observed in the corresponding human conditions. This is due largely to lack of precise methods for direct and comprehensive comparison at the molecular level of the mouse and human tumors. Here we use global gene expression patterns of 68 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) from seven different mouse models and 91 human HCCs from predefined subclasses to obtain direct comparison of the molecular features of mouse and human HCCs. Gene expression patterns in HCCs from Myc, E2f1 and Myc E2f1 transgenic mice were most similar to those of the better survival group of human HCCs, whereas the expression patterns in HCCs from Myc Tgfa transgenic mice and in diethylnitrosamine-induced mouse HCCs were most similar to those of the poorer survival group of human HCCs. Gene expression patterns in HCCs from Acox1(-/-) mice and in ciprofibrate-induced HCCs were least similar to those observed in human HCCs. We conclude that our approach can effectively identify appropriate mouse models to study human cancers.",1

15544973,"Changes in gene expression are likely to play a critical role in both acclimation and adaptation to a changing environment. There is a rapidly growing body of literature implicating quantitative changes in gene expression during acclimation to environmental change, but less is known about the role of qualitative changes in gene expression, such as switching between alternative isoforms. Alternative isoforms can arise via gene duplication, alternative splicing, or alternative promoter usage. Organisms that have undergone recent genome duplication events may make use of environment-specific isoforms coded by multiple genes, but their role in other organisms is less well known. However, recent data suggest that isoforms arising from alternative splicing may be an under-appreciated source of physiological variation. The role of changes in gene expression during evolutionary adaptation has received comparatively limited attention, but novel approaches to addressing the adaptive significance of changes in gene expression have been applied to a few cases of differences in gene expression among taxa. Recent advances in genomics, including microarray technology, knock-out and knock-down approaches, and the wealth of data coming from large-scale sequencing projects have provided (and will continue to provide at ever increasing rates) new insights into these classic questions in comparative biochemistry.",0
15544508,"Prior work within the taste aversion baseline of drug discrimination learning has demonstrated that the generalization function for individual rats is graded in nature. In such work, intermediate doses of the training drug produced intermediate levels of drug-appropriate responding. Under some conditions, such graded responding has been reported to be due to an averaging of quantal drug- and vehicle-appropriate responding at different periods within the session. The present experiment assessed the contribution of such averaging to the graded responding within the aversion design. Rats were first trained to discriminate either 1mg/kg naloxone or 10mg/kg pentobarbital from distilled water. They were then administered various doses of the training drug (or a different drug), and the within-session pattern of licking was monitored minute by minute over the 20min session. Responding within the session was primarily either drug- or vehicle-appropriate. The specific pattern of drug- or vehicle-appropriate responding was presumably dependent upon the onset and/or offset of the drug stimulus. Thus, for the aversion baseline the graded response function for individual rats appears to be a function of the within session averaging of quantal (either drug- or vehicle-appropriate) responding.",0
15540196,"Although microarray data have been successfully used for gene clustering and classification, the use of time series microarray data for constructing gene regulatory networks remains a particularly difficult task. The challenge lies in reliably inferring regulatory relationships from datasets that normally possess a large number of genes and a limited number of time points. In addition to the numerical challenge, the enormous complexity and dynamic properties of gene expression regulation also impede the progress of inferring gene regulatory relationships. Based on the accepted model of the relationship between regulator and target genes, we developed a new approach for inferring gene regulatory relationships by combining target-target pattern recognition and examination of regulator-specific binding sites in the promoter regions of putative target genes. Pattern recognition was accomplished in two steps: A first algorithm was used to search for the genes that share expression profile similarities with known target genes (KTGs) of each investigated regulator. The selected genes were further filtered by examining for the presence of regulator-specific binding sites in their promoter regions. As we implemented our approach to 18 yeast regulator genes and their known target genes, we discovered 267 new regulatory relationships, among which 15% are rediscovered, experimentally validated ones. Of the discovered target genes, 36.1% have the same or similar functions to a KTG of the regulator. An even larger number of inferred genes fall in the biological context and regulatory scope of their regulators. Since the regulatory relationships are inferred from pattern recognition between target-target genes, the method we present is especially suitable for inferring gene regulatory relationships in which there is a time delay between the expression of regulating and target genes.",1
15536153,"The WHIM syndrome is a rare immunodeficiency disorder characterized by warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis. Dominant heterozygous mutations of the gene encoding CXCR4, a G-protein-coupled receptor with a unique ligand, CXCL12, have been associated with this pathology. We studied patients belonging to 3 different pedigrees. Two siblings inherited a CXCR4 mutation encoding a novel C-terminally truncated receptor. Two unrelated patients were found to bear a wild-type CXCR4 open reading frame. Circulating lymphocytes and neutrophils from all patients displayed similar functional alterations of CXCR4-mediated responses featured by a marked enhancement of G-protein-dependent responses. This phenomenon relies on the refractoriness of CXCR4 to be both desensitized and internalized in response to CXCL12. Therefore, the aberrant dysfunction of the CXCR4-mediated signaling constitutes a common biologic trait of WHIM syndromes with different causative genetic anomalies. Responses to other chemokines, namely CCL4, CCL5, and CCL21, were preserved, suggesting that, in clinical forms associated with a wild-type CXCR4 open reading frame, the genetic anomaly might target an effector with some degree of selectivity for the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. We propose that the sustained CXCR4 activity in patient cells accounts for the immune-hematologic clinical manifestations and the profusion of warts characteristic of the WHIM syndrome.",1
15531155,"The remarkable diversity in the contents of genomes raises questions about how new genes and new functions originate. Recent evidence indicates that parasitism, particularly the molecular interactions between phage and their bacterial hosts, is a likely mechanism for generating new genes. This invention of such novel functions seems to be founded on a strategy that secures the short-term survival of parasitic elements and thereby contributes to the renovation of gene repertoires in their host.",0
15522294,"We have previously identified 60 predicted ABC transporter genes in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome and classified them into eight groups. As an initial step towards understanding how these putative ABC genes work in worms, we generated promoter-fluorescent protein fusions for the entire family to address when and where these genes are turned on in vivo. Both Aequoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Discosoma red fluorescent protein (RFP) were used as reporters in our transgenic assay. Observable expression is more frequently seen from fusions to genes in subfamilies B, C, D and E than those in subfamilies A and G. Sixteen worm ABC genes are found in tandem duplications, forming two four-gene clusters and four two-gene clusters. Fifteen out of the 16 duplicated gene promoters drove different or partially overlapping expression patterns, suggesting active functions for these duplicated genes. Furthermore, our results suggest that an internal promoter can cause differential expression of genes within an operon. Finally, our observations suggest that it is possible for coding sequences to function as a regulatory region for a neighbouring gene.",1
15517309,"Aberrant activation of Ras signaling is a common finding in human glioblastomas. To determine the contribution of Ras gene mutations to this aberration, we screened 94 glioblastomas for mutations in the three Ras family genes NRAS, KRAS and HRAS. All tumors were additionally analyzed for mutations in BRAF, which encodes a Ras-regulated serine/threonine kinase with oncogenic properties. Mutation analysis of the entire coding regions of NRAS and KRAS, as well as the known mutation hot-spot sites in HRAS, identified somatic point mutations in two glioblastomas, both affecting codon 12 of NRAS (c.35G>A, p.G12D). Three additional tumors carried BRAF mutations altering the known hot-spot codon 599 (c.1796T>A, p.V599E). None of these five glioblastomas showed amplification of the EGFR or PDGFRA genes, while three of the tumors, including two with NRAS and one with BRAF mutation, demonstrated PTEN missense mutations or loss of PTEN mRNA expression. Taken together, our data suggest activating mutations in NRAS or BRAF as a molecular alteration that contributes to aberrant Ras signaling in a small fraction of glioblastomas.",1
15496429,"Coronary artery disease (CAD), including its most serious complication myocardial infraction (MI), is the leading cause of death in the US and developed countries. We recently discovered that a seven-amino acid deletion in MEF2A, a transcription factor with a high level of expression in the endothelium of coronary arteries, co-segregates with CAD/MI in one family, and it suppresses transcription activation activity of MEF2A by a dominant-negative mechanism. In this study, we used single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequence analyses to identify mutations in MEF2A in 207 independent CAD/MI patients and 191 controls with normal angiograms. We identified three novel mutations in exon 7 of MEF2A in four of 207 CAD/MI patients (1.93%). No mutations were detected in the 191 controls. The mutations identified here include N263S identified in two independent CAD patients, P279L in one patient and his father with the diagnosis of CAD and G283D in one patient. These mutations are clustered within or close to the major transcriptional activation domain of MEF2A. They significantly reduce the transcriptional activation activity of MEF2A and act by a loss-of-function mechanism. The gene carriers with loss-of-function mutations appear to be associated with less severe CAD. These results suggest that CAD/MI can result from a spectrum of MEF2A transcription dysfunctions ranging from loss-of-function to dominant-negative suppression and that a significant percent of the CAD/MI population (1.93%) may carry mutations in MEF2A, although further definition of the prevalence of MEF2A mutations is warranted.",1
15492775,"We have investigated the cis-regulatory network that mediates temporal gene expression during organogenesis. Previous studies demonstrated that the organ selector gene pha-4/FoxA is critical to establish the onset of transcription of Caenorhabditis elegans foregut (pharynx) genes. Here, we discover additional cis-regulatory elements that function in combination with PHA-4. We use a computational approach to identify candidate cis-regulatory sites for genes activated either early or late during pharyngeal development. Analysis of natural or synthetic promoters reveals that six of these sites function in vivo. The newly discovered temporal elements, together with predicted PHA-4 sites, account for the onset of expression of roughly half of the pharyngeal genes examined. Moreover, combinations of temporal elements and PHA-4 sites can be used in genome-wide searches to predict pharyngeal genes, with more than 85% accuracy for their onset of expression. These findings suggest a regulatory code for temporal gene expression during foregut development and provide a means to predict gene expression patterns based solely on genomic sequence.",0
15483080,"Obesity is a prominent feature of the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), one subset of which, BBS6, is due to mutations in the chaperonin-like gene termed the McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKKS) gene. We tested whether variation in MKKS contributes to common and probably polygenic forms of obesity by performing mutation analysis of the coding region in 60 Danish white men with juvenile-onset obesity. Five variants were identified, including two synonymous mutations (Pro(39)Pro and Ile(178)Ile) and three nonsynonymous variants (Ala(242)Ser, Arg(517)Cys, and Gly(532)Val). Furthermore, the rare Ala(242)Ser was identified in two families and showed partial cosegregation with obesity. The Pro(39)Pro, Ile(178)Ile, and Arg(517)Cys variants are in complete linkage disequilibrium and defined a prevalent haplotype. In a case-control study, the Arg(517)Cys polymorphism allele prevalence was 11.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 9.7-13.0] among 744 men with juvenile-onset obesity and 9.3% (CI, 7.9-10.7) among 867 control subjects (P = 0.048). However, among middle-aged men the allelic prevalence was 9.7% (CI, 7.9-11.4) among 523 obese men and 12.2% (CI, 10.8-13.6) among 1051 lean men (P = 0.037). In conclusion, it is unlikely that MKKS variants play a major role in the pathogenesis of nonsyndromic obesity, although in rare cases the A242S allele may contribute to obesity.",1

15386372,"Gene promoter hypermethylation is increasingly recognized to play an important role in cancer development through silencing of gene transcription. This study determined the methylation profiles of primary colorectal cancers and adenomas to elucidate the role of epigenetic changes in different stages of colorectal carcinogenesis. We examined the methylation profiles of 47 sporadic colorectal cancers, 36 colonic adenomas from patients without cancer and 34 colonic biopsies from patients without colonic lesions. Paired adjacent dysplasia tissues obtained from 17 cancer patients were also examined. Promoter hypermethylation in 10 tumor-related genes (APC, ATM, GSTP1, HLTF, MGMT, hMLH1, p14, p15, SOCS-1 and TIMP-3) were studied by methylation-specific PCR. Promoter hypermethylation was frequently detected in more than 40% of colonic cancers and adenomas in APC, ATM, HLTF, MGMT and hMLH1 genes (p < 0.0001 vs. normal). While low level of methylation was detected in p14, p15 and TIMP-3, there was no methylation detected in GSTP1 and SOCS-1. The frequencies of methylation were comparable between tumors and adenomas, and advanced and nonadvanced adenoma. In contrast, K-ras mutation was only detected in advanced adenomas and cancers. Concurrent methylation in >/= 3 genes was found in 66.7% adenomas and 68.1% cancers but not in normal colonic tissues. Methylation was associated with reduced protein expressions in colorectal adenomas and cancers. Moreover, methylation in ATM was more common in older cancer patients (p = 0.002), but there was no significant association between promoter hypermethylation and other clinicopathologic characteristics of cancer. Our study demonstrated the early and specific involvement of promoter hypermethylation in the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence.",1

15296936,"Members of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs) family share common structural features including a disintegrin domain, a zinc metalloprotease domain, and at least one thrombospondin motif. Aberrant expression of several of these proteins has led to an understanding of their role in human disease; however, a link to function for many has not yet been made. One such uncharacterized family member, ADAMTS-8, shares significant protein sequence homology with a subgroup of ADAMTSs that includes ADAMTS-1, ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5, and ADAMTS-15. Each of these proteases has been shown to cleave 'aggrecanase-susceptible' site(s) within the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycan aggrecan, and ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 have been postulated to play a role in the depletion of articular cartilage in osteoarthritic disease. Based on sequence relationships, in the present study we examined the ability of ADAMTS-8 to exhibit 'aggrecanase' activity. A neoepitope monoclonal antibody (MAb; AGG-C1; anti-NITEGE373) was developed and used to demonstrate the ability of ADAMTS-8 to cleave aggrecan at the aggrecanase-susceptible Glu373-Ala374 peptide bond. In addition, expression analyses demonstrated the presence of ADAMTS-8 mRNA transcripts in normal and osteoarthritic human cartilage.",1
15292867,"New treatments for orofacial pain have been developed in recent years. In the case of cluster headache, new drugs are now administered via the intranasal route, while in patients with chewing pain the topical application of capsaicin and the use of oral splints in combination with jaw movement exercises are the most widely used management approaches. In the case of neurogenic pain new anticonvulsivants have been introduced, with fewer side effects than carbamazepine. The latest pharmacological advances involve the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and opioids via the topical route, and the combination of different analgesics. The present review discusses the latest advances in the treatment of orofacial pain.",1
15282333,"The role of natural selection in biology is well appreciated. Recently, however, a critical role for physical principles of network self-organization in biological systems has been revealed. Here, we employ a systems level view of genome-scale sequence and expression data to examine the interplay between these two sources of order, natural selection and physical self-organization, in the evolution of human gene regulation. The topology of a human gene coexpression network, derived from tissue-specific expression profiles, shows scale-free properties that imply evolutionary self-organization via preferential node attachment. Genes with numerous coexpressed partners (the hubs of the coexpression network) evolve more slowly on average than genes with fewer coexpressed partners, and genes that are coexpressed show similar rates of evolution. Thus, the strength of selective constraints on gene sequences is affected by the topology of the gene coexpression network. This connection is strong for the coding regions and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), but the 5' UTRs appear to evolve under a different regime. Surprisingly, we found no connection between the rate of gene sequence divergence and the extent of gene expression profile divergence between human and mouse. This suggests that distinct modes of natural selection might govern sequence versus expression divergence, and we propose a model, based on rapid, adaptation-driven divergence and convergent evolution of gene expression patterns, for how natural selection could influence gene expression divergence.",0
15282206,"CD36 is a class B scavenger receptor recognizing a variety of ligands including long-chain fatty acids and modified LDL. We investigated whether genetic variability at this locus is a determinant of free fatty acid (FFA) plasma levels and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in Caucasians. Typing of 21 polymorphic markers, evenly spanning the CD36 gene, revealed two linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks that could be tagged by five polymorphisms (-33137A>G, -31118G>A, 25444G>A, 27645del>ins and 30294G>C). In 585 non-diabetic individuals of Caucasian origin, the 30294G>C polymorphism was significantly associated with FFA levels (P = 0.02)--an effect that was especially visible among men (P = 0.009). A similar association was observed in this gender at -33137 (P = 0.008) and -31118 (P = 0.028). When the five tag polymorphisms were considered together, men carrying the AGGIG haplotype had 31% higher FFA (P = 0.0002) and 20% higher triglycerides (P = 0.025) than non-carriers. The same haplotype was associated with increased risk of CAD in 197 type 2 diabetic individuals from the US (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.2). A similar tendency was observed in a group of 321 type 2 diabetic individuals from Italy (OR = 1.4, 0.9-2.3), resulting in an overall relative risk of 1.6 (1.1-2.3, P = 0.015) in the two populations considered together. By targeted resequencing, we identified a common variant in the CD36 promoter that is in strong LD with the AGGIG haplotype and could be partly responsible for these findings. In conclusion, this comprehensive study of CD36 variability indicates that the common polymorphisms at this locus modulate lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risk in Caucasians.",1
15272417,"Lung cancer is a major cause of death in the United States and other countries. The risk of lung cancer is greatly increased by cigarette smoking and by certain occupational exposures, but familial factors also clearly play a major role. To identify susceptibility genes for familial lung cancer, we conducted a genomewide linkage analysis of 52 extended pedigrees ascertained through probands with lung cancer who had several first-degree relatives with the same disease. Multipoint linkage analysis, under a simple autosomal dominant model, of all 52 families with three or more individuals affected by lung, throat, or laryngeal cancer, yielded a maximum heterogeneity LOD score (HLOD) of 2.79 at 155 cM on chromosome 6q (marker D6S2436). A subset of 38 pedigrees with four or more affected individuals yielded a multipoint HLOD of 3.47 at 155 cM. Analysis of a further subset of 23 multigenerational pedigrees with five or more affected individuals yielded a multipoint HLOD score of 4.26 at the same position. The 14 families with only three affected relatives yielded negative LOD scores in this region. A predivided samples test for heterogeneity comparing the LOD scores from the 23 multigenerational families with those from the remaining families was significant (P=.007). The 1-HLOD multipoint support interval from the multigenerational families extends from C6S1848 at 146 cM to 164 cM near D6S1035, overlapping a genomic region that is deleted in sporadic lung cancers as well as numerous other cancer types. Parametric linkage and variance-components analysis that incorporated effects of age and personal smoking also supported linkage in this region, but with somewhat diminished support. These results localize a major susceptibility locus influencing lung cancer risk to 6q23-25.",1
15258833,"Patients with 9q34.3 terminal deletion usually show a clinically recognizable phenotype characterized by specific facial features (microcephaly, flat face, arched eyebrows, hypertelorism, short nose, anteverted nostrils, carp mouth and protruding tongue) in combination with severe mental retardation, hypotonia, and other anomalies. We analyzed six unrelated patients with a various 9q34.3 terminal deletion. While having different-sized 9q34.3 deletions, all of these patients shared several distinctive anomalies. These anomalies are likely to arise from a commonly deleted region at distal 9q34.3. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using a dozen BAC clones mapped at the 9q34.13-q34.3 region defined the shortest region of deletion overlap (SRO) as a 1-Mb segment proximal to 9qter containing eight known genes. Possible candidate genes delineating specific phenotypes of the 9q34.3 terminal deletion syndrome are discussed.",1
15204898,"With the wide variety of health problems reported by adults who experienced childhood sexual abuse (CSA), and no universality for any of them, it is vital that treatment and research be theory-based. The purpose of this article is to review the highlights of major theories, models, and conceptual frameworks found in the literature that explain the relationship of CSA with adult health problems, along with their associated moderating or mediating variables. The theories vary in their scope (macro, middle range, or micro), and in the health problems they explain, from purely psychosocial to both physical and psychosocial problems.",0
15175242,"Tumor development is dependent upon the inactivation of two key tumor-suppressor networks, p16(Ink4a)-cycD/cdk4-pRB-E2F and p19(Arf)-mdm2-p53, that regulate cellular proliferation and the tumor surveillance response. These networks are known to intersect with one another, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that E2F directly participates in the transcriptional control of Arf in both normal and transformed cells. This occurs in a manner that is significantly different from the regulation of classic E2F-responsive targets. In wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), the Arf promoter is occupied by E2F3 and not other E2F family members. In quiescent cells, this role is largely fulfilled by E2F3b, an E2F3 isoform whose function was previously undetermined. E2f3 loss is sufficient to derepress Arf, triggering activation of p53 and expression of p21(Cip1). Thus, E2F3 is a key repressor of the p19(Arf)-p53 pathway in normal cells. Consistent with this notion, Arf mutation suppresses the activation of p53 and p21(Cip1) in E2f3-deficient MEFs. Arf loss also rescues the known cell cycle re-entry defect of E2f3(-/-) cells, and this correlates with restoration of appropriate activation of classic E2F-responsive genes. Our data also demonstrate a direct role for E2F in the oncogenic activation of Arf. Specifically, we observe recruitment of the endogenous activating E2Fs, E2F1, and E2F3a, to the Arf promoter. Thus, distinct E2F complexes directly contribute to the normal repression and oncogenic activation of Arf. We propose that monitoring of E2F levels and/or activity is a key component of Arf's ability to respond to inappropriate, but not normal cellular proliferation.",1
15175116,"A number of completely sequenced eukaryotic genome data are available in the public domain. Eukaryotic genes are either 'intron containing' or 'intronless'. Eukaryotic 'intronless' genes are interesting datasets for comparative genomics and evolutionary studies. The SEGE database containing a collection of eukaryotic single exon genes is available. However, SEGE is derived using GenBank. The redundant, incomplete and heterogeneous qualities of GenBank data are a bottleneck for biological investigation in comparative genomics and evolutionary studies. Such studies often require representative gene sets from each genome and this is possible only by deriving specific datasets from completely sequenced genome data. Thus Genome SEGE, a database for 'intronless' genes in completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes, has been constructed.",0

15141374,"Epithelial ovarian tumours represent a complex group of histological subtypes and there has long been controversy over the question of a precursor lesion for these neoplasms. The application of mutation analysis of the KRAS and BRAF genes (members of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK-MAP kinase pathway) is consistent with the model for progression of mucinous carcinomas and a subset of serous carcinomas (the so-called low-grade serous carcinomas) through benign and borderline lesions. The relatively high incidence of BRAF and KRAS mutations in serous borderline tumours and low-grade serous carcinomas, and their extremely low incidence/absence in high-grade serous carcinomas, provide strong evidence that high-grade carcinomas do not arise through this intermediate step.",1

15124029,"All organisms have elaborate mechanisms to control rates of protein production. However, protein production is also subject to stochastic fluctuations, or ""noise."" Several recent studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli have investigated the relationship between transcription and translation rates and stochastic fluctuations in protein levels, or more generally, how such randomness is a function of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. However, the fundamental question of whether stochasticity in protein expression is generally biologically relevant has not been addressed, and it remains unknown whether random noise in the protein production rate of most genes significantly affects the fitness of any organism. We propose that organisms should be particularly sensitive to variation in the protein levels of two classes of genes: genes whose deletion is lethal to the organism and genes that encode subunits of multiprotein complexes. Using an experimentally verified model of stochastic gene expression in S. cerevisiae, we estimate the noise in protein production for nearly every yeast gene, and confirm our prediction that the production of essential and complex-forming proteins involves lower levels of noise than does the production of most other genes. Our results support the hypothesis that noise in gene expression is a biologically important variable, is generally detrimental to organismal fitness, and is subject to natural selection.",0

Despite the variety of strategies applied, only 30% of predicted human genes have any function assigned.

15067328,"Several lines of evidence show that the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requires an accumulation of genetic alterations. However, molecular mechanism in HCC carcinogenesis remains unsolved. A total of 89 HCC samples were analyzed in this study to determine how alterations in the Wnt signaling pathway associate with the carcinogenesis of HCC. beta-catenin immunohistochemistry showed positive nuclear staining in 24 (27.0%) of the 89 HCC samples, indicating the existence of alterations in the Wnt signaling pathway in those 24 HCC samples. Mutations in the beta-catenin, Axin1 and Axin2 genes were detected in 10 (41.7%), 13 (54.2%) and 9 (37.5%) of the 24 beta-catenin-positive samples, respectively, but no mutation was detected in the APC gene. In conclusion, in addition to mutations in the beta-catenin gene, mutations in the Axin1 and Axin2 genes may alter the Wnt signaling pathway, resulting in accumulation of beta-catenin.",1
15053845,"It is thought that genes with similar patterns of mRNA expression and genes with similar functions are likely to be regulated via the same mechanisms.

Prediction of the gene structure is based on homology between the gene product and a known protein or between the genomic sequences of the gene and its homolog from another organism. The methods were tested and proved highly efficient. Human gene splicing was analyzed with original methods and EST databases. Genes with alternative splicing were for the first time shown to account for no less than 35% total genes. Alternative splicing was compared for the human and mouse genomes. Species-specific isoforms were demonstrated for 50% alternatively spliced genes (25% total genes).",0

The latter can be undertaken with several new technologies such as DNA microarray and serial analysis of gene expression. Proteome analysis has come to the fore in recent years providing a crucial link between the gene and its protein product.

14997421,"Sotos syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome characterized by pre- and postnatal overgrowth, macrocephaly, advanced bone age, variable degrees of mental retardation, and typical facial features. Defects of the NSD1 gene account for >or=60% of cases of Sotos syndrome, whereas the disease-causing mechanism of other cases remains unknown. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a distinct overgrowth condition characterized by macroglossia, abdominal-wall defects, visceromegaly, embryonic tumors, hemihyperplasia, ear anomalies, renal anomalies, and neonatal hypoglycemia. Deregulation of imprinted growth-regulatory genes within the 11p15 region is the major cause of BWS, whereas the molecular defect underlying a significant proportion of sporadic BWS cases remains unknown. Owing to clinical overlaps between the two syndromes, we investigated whether unexplained cases of Sotos syndrome could be related to 11p15 anomalies and, conversely, whether unexplained BWS cases could be related to NSD1 deletions or mutations. Two 11p15 anomalies were identified in a series of 20 patients with Sotos syndrome, and two NSD1 mutations were identified in a series of 52 patients with BWS. These results suggest that the two disorders may have more similarities than previously thought and that NSD1 could be involved in imprinting of the chromosome 11p15 region.",1
14993205,"Functional modules are considered the primary building blocks of biomolecular systems. Here we study to what extent functional modules behave cohesively across genomes:That is, are functional modules also evolutionary modules? We probe this question by analyzing for a large collection of functional modules the phyletic patterns of their genes across 110 genomes. The majority of functional modules display limited evolutionary modularity. This result confirms certain comparative genome analyses, but is in contrast to implicit assumptions in the systems analysis of functional genomics data. We show that this apparent interspecies flexibility in the organization of functional modules depends more on functional differentiation within orthologous groups of genes, than on noise in the functional module definitions. When filtering out these sources of nonmodularity, even though very few functional modules behave perfectly modular in evolution, about half behave at least significantly more modular than a random set of genes. There are substantial differences in the evolutionary modularity between individual functional modules as well as between collections of functional modules, partly corresponding to conceptual differences in the functional module definition, which make comparisons between functional module collections biologically difficult to interpret. Analysis within one collection does not suffer from such differences, and we show that within the EcoCyc metabolic pathway database, biosynthetic pathways are evolutionarily more modular than catabolic pathways.",0
14972029,"The fourth member of Ca2+-dependent mammalian secretory subtilase, PC4 (proprotein convertase 4), is primarily expressed in testicular germ cell and ovarian macrophage. Its role in sperm fertilization and in early embryonic development has been demonstrated earlier through several studies, including those with PC4 null mice. A number of physiological substrates found in reproductive tissues have been postulated or identified for PC4 by various biochemical studies. These include growth factors IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) and IGF-2, hormonal polypeptide proPACAP (where PACAP stands for pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide) and a number of surface proteins of ADAM (ADisintegrin And Metalloproteinase-like) family such as ADAM-1 (fertilin a), ADAM-2 (fertilin b), ADAM-3 (procyritestin) and ADAM-5. To provide further evidence in support of this notion and also to study the substrate specificity and bioassay of PC4, a series of intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptides containing the cleavage sites and several mutants were prepared. A comparative kinetic analysis and measurement of Vmax (app)/Km (app) ratio of these fluorogenic substrates against PC4 and PC7 revealed that the mutant variants of h (human) proPACAP and m (mouse) ADAM-5 derived peptides Q-PACAP141-151-mutant [Abz-141RVKNKGRRI150P151SY(NO2)-A-CONH2] (150A151Y replaced by PS) and Q-ADAM-5380-388-mutant [Abz-380E381PKPARRP388RY(NO2)A-CONH2] (381R replaced by P) are most efficiently and selectively cleaved by PC4. Using these two and Q-IGF-263-71 peptides, we showed that the sperm extract of normal adult mice is much higher when compared with that of PC4-null mice. This suggests that these fluorogenic peptides are useful for specific bioassay of PC4 activity. In addition, kinetic studies with various peptidyl-MCA indicate that the hexapeptide Ac-KTKQLR-MCA (where MCA stands for 4-methyl coumaryl-7-amide) is most efficiently and selectively cleaved by PC4 at RMCA, making it another effective agent for bioassay of PC4 activity. The study concludes that the most probable sequence motif for recognition by PC4 is KXKXXR or KXXR, where X is any amino acid other than cysteine and that it prefers proline at P3, P5 and/or P2' positions. It was also revealed that PC4 is a good candidate processing enzyme for growth factors IGF-1 and -2, neuropeptide proPACAP and several ADAM proteins such as ADAM-1, -2, -3 and -5.",1

By retrospective analysis for the 14 year data of occupational injury, we found the decreasing trend of incidence of occupational injury in steel industry, male has greater incidence of occupational injury than female, the shorter of duration of employment means a greater incidence of occupational injury. The major body part of occupational injury are the head and extremity, the major nature of injury are burns and fracture. The most cause of injuries are violation of regulation and distraction of attention by the victim himself or herself, the next reasons are the limitation of equipments and the bad condition of production.",0
14962108,"Psoriasis patients exposed to high cumulative doses of psoralen + ultraviolet A frequently exhibit so-called ""psoralen + ultraviolet A keratoses"" (i.e., hyperkeratotic lesions with varying degrees of histologic atypia). The exact causes and molecular mechanisms of psoralen + ultraviolet A keratoses however, are not clear. We therefore performed DNA mutational analysis of the tumor suppressor gene p53 (exons in psoralen + ultraviolet A keratoses from 10 long-term psoralen + ultraviolet A-treated psoriasis patients. We detected 39 p53 mutations in 16 of 28 psoralen + ultraviolet A keratoses (57%) and 18 Ha-ras mutations in 11 of 25 psoralen + ultraviolet A keratoses (44%). Of the 39 p53 mutations and 18 Ha-ras mutations, 22 (56%) and 13 (72%), respectively, were of the ultraviolet fingerprint type (C-->T or CC-->TT transitions at dipyrimidine sites); 13 (33%) and two (11%), respectively, occurred at potential psoralen-binding sites (5'-TpA, 5'-TpG, or 5'-TpT DNA sequences) and were potentially psoralen + ultraviolet A induced; two (5%) and three (17%), respectively, were of ambiguous origin (ultraviolet and/or psoralen + ultraviolet A); and two (5%) and none (0%), respectively, were of the ""other"" type, respectively. We conclude that (1) the frequent mutation of p53 and Ha-ras may play a key part in the formation of at least some psoralen + ultraviolet A keratoses; (2) environmental and/or therapeutic ultraviolet exposure may be a major cause of psoralen + ultraviolet A keratosis as most Ha-ras and p53 mutations are induced by ultraviolet light; and (3) psoralen + ultraviolet A itself plays a smaller, though direct, role in causing these mutations.",1
14764925,"One of the primary tasks in deciphering the functional contents of a newly sequenced genome is the identification of its protein coding genes. Existing computational methods for gene prediction include ab initio methods which use the DNA sequence itself as the only source of information, comparative methods using multiple genomic sequences, and similarity based methods which employ the cDNA or protein sequences of related genes to aid the gene prediction. We present here an algorithm implemented in a computer program called Projector which combines comparative and similarity approaches. Projector employs similarity information at the genomic DNA level by directly using known genes annotated on one DNA sequence to predict the corresponding related genes on another DNA sequence. It therefore makes explicit use of the conservation of the exon-intron structure between two related genes in addition to the similarity of their encoded amino acid sequences. We evaluate the performance of Projector by comparing it with the program Genewise on a test set of 491 pairs of independently confirmed mouse and human genes. It is more accurate than Genewise for genes whose proteins are <80% identical, and is suitable for use in a combined gene prediction system where other methods identify well conserved and non-conserved genes, and pseudogenes.",0
14762064,"It is believed that 3.2 billion bp of the human genome harbor approximately 35000 protein-coding genes. On average, one could expect one gene per 300000 nucleotides (nt). Although the distribution of the genes in the human genome is not random,it is rather surprising that a large number of genes overlap in the mammalian genomes. Thousands of overlapping genes were recently identified in the human and mouse genomes. However,the origin and evolution of overlapping genes are still unknown. We identified 1316 pairs of overlapping genes in humans and mice and studied their evolutionary patterns. It appears that these genes do not demonstrate greater than usual conservation. Studies of the gene structure and overlap pattern showed that only a small fraction of analyzed genes preserved exactly the same pattern in both organisms.",0
14728346,"Microarrays allow researchers to gather data about the expression patterns of thousands of genes simultaneously. Statistical analysis can reveal which genes show statistically significant results. Making biological sense of those results requires the retrieval of functional information about the genes thus identified, typically a manual gene-by-gene retrieval of information from various on-line databases. For experiments generating thousands of genes of interest, retrieval of functional information can become a significant bottleneck. To address this issue, we are currently developing a prototype system to automate the process of retrieval of functional information from multiple on-line sources.",0
14707170,"The alignment of full-length human cDNA sequences to the finished sequence of the human genome provides a unique opportunity to study the distribution of genes throughout the genome. By analyzing the distances between 23,752 genes, we identified a class of divergently transcribed gene pairs, representing more than 10% of the genes in the genome, whose transcription start sites are separated by less than 1000 base pairs. Although this bidirectional arrangement has been previously described in humans and other species, the prevalence of bidirectional gene pairs in the human genome is striking, and the mechanisms of regulation of all but a few bidirectional genes are unknown. Our work shows that the transcripts of many bidirectional pairs are coexpressed, but some are antiregulated. Further, we show that many of the promoter segments between two bidirectional genes initiate transcription in both directions and contain shared elements that regulate both genes. We also show that the bidirectional arrangement is often conserved among mouse orthologs. These findings demonstrate that a bidirectional arrangement provides a unique mechanism of regulation for a significant number of mammalian genes.",0
14688025,"Colorectal cancer is a multi-step process characterized by a sequence of genetic alterations in cell growth regulatory genes, such as the adenomatous polyposis coli, KRAS, p53 and DCC genes. In the present study mutation analysis was performed with SSCA/direct sequencing of the hot-spot regions in exons 11 and 15 for the BRAF gene and exons 1-2 for the KRAS gene in 130 primary colorectal cancer tumors and correlated with clinico-pathological and mutational data. We also performed mutation analysis of the corresponding conserved regions in the ARAF and RAF-1 genes. Mutations in the BRAF and KRAS genes were found in 11.5 and 40% of the tumors, respectively. One germline exonic and nine germline intronic genetic variants were found in the ARAF and RAF-1 genes. All of the BRAF mutations were located in the kinase domain of the conserved region 3 in exon 15 of the BRAF gene. One novel somatic mutation was also identified in the BRAF gene. The majority of the BRAF mutations were found in colon compared with rectal tumors (P = 0.014). In agreement with others, a statistically significant correlation between BRAF mutations and microsatellite instability could be found. A negative correlation was also evident between mutations in the BRAF and KRAS genes, which supports earlier studies where somatic mutations in these genes are mutually exclusive. Collectively, our results provide support for the idea that activation of the MAP kinase pathway, especially via BRAF and KRAS mutations, is of critical importance for the development of colorectal cancer.",1

14641098,"One of the central problems of functional genomics is revealing gene expression networks - the relationships between genes that reflect observations of how the expression level of each gene affects those of others. Microarray data are currently a major source of information about the interplay of biochemical network participants in living cells. Various mathematical techniques, such as differential equations, Bayesian and Boolean models and several statistical methods, have been applied to expression data in attempts to extract the underlying knowledge. Unsupervised clustering methods are often considered as the necessary first step in visualization and analysis of the expression data. As for supervised classification, the problem mainly addressed so far has been how to find discriminative genes separating various samples or experimental conditions. Numerous methods have been applied to identify genes that help to predict treatment outcome or to confirm a diagnosis, as well as to identify primary elements of gene regulatory circuits. However, less attention has been devoted to using supervised learning to uncover relationships between genes and/or their products. To start filling this gap a machine-learning approach for gene networks reconstruction is described here. This approach is based on building classifiers--functions, which determine the state of a gene's transcription machinery through expression levels of other genes. The method can be applied to various cases where relationships between gene expression levels could be expected.",0

14574132,"Gene expression in higher organisms, is, to a large degree, controlled at the level of transcription, where DNA-binding proteins (transcription factors) play an influential role in gene regulation. This is achieved through various mechanisms, including those that involve silencer and enhancer regions. Variation in those regulatory regions, as well as in the genes encoding the transcription factors, has been shown to generate functional effects at the molecular, cellular, and neurobehavioral levels. The aim of the present paper is two-fold. First, for the sake of clarity and to reintroduce the terminology to Behavior Genetics readers, we review the concepts of gene structure, gene expression, and gene regulation. Second, using distinct bioinformatic tools, we set out to identify transcription factors that could be involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes known to be associated with aggressive behavior in mice. The results of this in silico study reveal common putative transcription factor binding sites among the set of genes investigated (especially for SRY), suggesting similar molecular transcriptional mechanisms.",1
14556920,"The frequency and mechanism of p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) gene alterations were studied in cell samples from 30 patients with Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), both at diagnosis and at the onset of the accelerated phase (AP) of the disease. No alterations in the p16(INK4A) or p14(ARF) genes were found in any of the chronic phase (CP) samples. DNA sequencing analyses detected p16(INK4A) or p14(ARF) mutations in 17 AP samples. All mutations were heterozygous without loss of the other allele. Aberrant methylation of the p16(INK4A) or p14(ARF) promoters was found in 14 of 30 AP samples. The most common situation was the simultaneous methylation of both promoters. Our data indicate that p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) are primary targets for inactivation by promoter methylation in the acceleration of CML. Transcriptional silencing of the p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) genes may be important in the conversion of CML from the CP to the AP.",1
14508503,"In contrast to the frequent dominant optic atrophies (DOAs) in which the neuropathy is usually an isolated event, isolated recessive optic atrophies (ROAs) are very uncommon and have been described as severe congenital or early infantile conditions. To date, two loci for isolated DOA have been mapped, of which one was ascribed to mutations in the OPA1 gene. Conversely, no isolated autosomal ROA locus had previously been localised. Here, we report a large multiplex consanguineous family of French origin affected with an early onset but slowly progressive form of isolated OA. A genome-wide search for homozygosity allowed the localisation of the disease-causing gene to chromosome 8q21-q22 (Zmax of 3.41 at theta=0 for D8S270), in a 12 Mb interval flanked by markers D8S1702 and D8S1794.

14507372,"Cone snails, which are predatory marine gastropods, produce a cocktail of venoms used for predation, defense and competition. The major venom component, conotoxin, has received significant attention because it is useful in neuroscience research, drug development and molecular diversity studies. In this study, we report the genomic characterization of nine conotoxin gene superfamilies from 18 Conus species and investigate the relationships among conotoxin gene structure, molecular evolution and diversity. The I1, I2, M, O2, O3, P, S, and T superfamily precursors all contain three exons and two introns, while A superfamily members contain two exons and one intron. The introns are conserved within a certain gene superfamily, and also conserved across different Conus species, but divergent among different superfamilies. The intronic sequences contain many simple repeat sequences and regulatory elements that may influence conotoxin gene expression. Furthermore, due to the unique gene structure of conotoxins, the base substitution rates and the number of positively selected sites vary greatly among exons. Many more point mutations and trinucleotide indels were observed in the mature peptide exon than in the other exons. In addition, the first example of alternative splicing in conotoxin genes was found. These results suggest that the diversity of conotoxin genes has been shaped by point mutations and indels, as well as rare gene recombination or alternative splicing events, and that the unique gene structures could have made a contribution to the evolution of conotoxin genes.",0

13680365,"Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a common human genetic condition resulting from mutations in at least twelve different genes. OCA1 results from mutations of the tyrosinase gene and presents with the life-long absence of melanin pigment after birth (OCA1A) or with the development of minimal-to-moderate amounts of cutaneous and ocular pigment (OCA1B). Other types of OCA have variable amounts of cutaneous and ocular pigment. We hypothesized that white hair at birth indicates OCA1 and tested this in a sample of 120 probands with OCA and white hair at birth. We found that 102 (85%) of the probands had OCA1 with one or two identifiable tyrosinase gene mutations, with 169 (83%) of the 204 OCA1 tyrosinase gene alleles having identifiable mutations and 35 (17%) having no identifiable change in the coding, splice junction, or proximal promoter regions of the gene. The inability to identify the mutation was more common with OCA1B (24/35, 69%) than with OCA1A (11/35, 31%) alleles. Seven probands with no tyrosinase gene mutations were found to have OCA2 with one or two P gene mutations, and in eleven, no mutations were detected in either gene. We conclude that (1) the presence of white hair at birth is a useful clinical tool suggesting OCA1 in a child or adult with OCA, although OCA2 may also have this presentation; (2) the molecular analysis of the tyrosinase and P genes are necessary for precise diagnosis; and (3) the presence of alleles without identifiable mutations of the tyrosinase gene, particularly in OCA1B, suggests that more complex mutation mechanisms of this gene are common in OCA.",1
12973666,"The autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs), comprising Graves disease (GD) and Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT), develop as a result of a complex interaction between predisposing genes and environmental triggers. Previously, we identified six loci that showed evidence for linkage with AITD in a data set of 56 multiplex families. The goals of the present study were to replicate/reject the previously identified loci before fine mapping and sequencing the candidate genes in these regions. We performed a whole-genome linkage study in an expanded data set of 102 multiplex families with AITD (540 individuals), through use of 400 microsatellite markers. Seven loci showed evidence for linkage to AITD. Three loci, on chromosomes 6p, 8q, and 10q, showed evidence for linkage with both GD and HT (maximum multipoint heterogeneity LOD scores [HLOD] 2.0, 3.5, and 4.1, respectively). Three loci showed evidence for linkage with GD: on 7q (HLOD 2.3), 14q (HLOD 2.1), and 20q (LOD 3.3, in a subset of the families). One locus on 12q showed evidence of linkage with HT, giving an HLOD of 3.4. Comparison with the results obtained in the original data set showed that the 20q (GD-2) and 12q (HT-2) loci continued to show evidence for linkage in the expanded data set; the 6p and 14q loci were located within the same region as the previously identified 6p and 14q loci (AITD-1 and GD-1, respectively), but the Xq (GD-3) and 13q (HT-1) loci were not replicated in the expanded data set. These results demonstrated that multiple genes may predispose to GD and HT and that some may be common to both diseases and some are unique. The loci that continue to show evidence for linkage in the expanded data set represent serious candidate regions for gene identification.",1
12972257,"We consider the design of a type of repressible gene circuit that is common in bacteria. In this type of circuit, a regulator protein acts to coordinately repress the expression of effector genes when a signal molecule with which it interacts is present. The regulator protein can also independently influence the expression of its own gene, such that regulator gene expression is repressible (like effector genes), constitutive, or inducible. Thus, a signal-directed change in the activity of the regulator protein can result in one of three patterns of coupled regulator and effector gene expression: direct coupling, in which regulator and effector gene expression change in the same direction; uncoupling, in which regulator gene expression remains constant while effector gene expression changes; or inverse coupling, in which regulator and effector gene expression change in opposite directions. We have investigated the functional consequences of each form of coupling using a mathematical model to compare alternative circuits on the basis of engineering-inspired criteria for functional effectiveness. The results depend on whether the regulator protein acts as a repressor or activator of transcription at the promoters of effector genes. In the case of repressor control of effector gene expression, direct coupling is optimal among the three forms of coupling, whereas in the case of activator control, inverse coupling is optimal. Results also depend on the sensitivity of effector gene expression to changes in the level of a signal molecule; the optimal form of coupling can be physically realized only for circuits with sufficiently small sensitivity. These theoretical results provide a rationale for autoregulation of regulator genes in repressible gene circuits and lead to testable predictions, which we have compared with data available in the literature and electronic databases.",0
12963979,"The components of the Wnt-signaling pathway are reported to be mutated in human cancer cells, but the relationship between the components and oral squamous carcinoma (SCC) is still unknown. In this study, we analyzed the epigenetic changes and expression patterns of four member proteins of the Wnt-signaling pathway and analyzed the mutations of beta-catenin and AXIN 1 genes, in order to explore the roles of the pathway in the development of oral cancer. The results showed that there are no beta-catenin and AXIN 1 gene mutations and no methylation of the CpG island of beta-catenin, AXIN I and GSK3beta genes in oral cancer cells; methylation of the CpG island of APC occurs in the precancerous stage and it is a dynamic change; the aberrant expressions or abnormal localization of the Wnt-signaling pathway proteins have no relationship with methylation status or mutation. From our results, we suggest that the Wnt pathway related genes play a very limited role in the development of oral SCC.",1

We here show that a t(7;16)(q33;p11) in two cases of low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma fuses the FUS gene to BBF2H7, a previously uncharacterized gene that is homologous to the Drosophila Bbf-2 gene. BBF2H7 spans more than 120 kbp genomic DNA, is composed of 12 exons and contains a 1560 bp open reading frame.

12879365,"There is increasing evidence for strong genetic influences on athletic performance and for an evolutionary ""trade-off"" between performance traits for speed and endurance activities. We have recently demonstrated that the skeletal-muscle actin-binding protein alpha-actinin-3 is absent in 18% of healthy white individuals because of homozygosity for a common stop-codon polymorphism in the ACTN3 gene, R577X. alpha-Actinin-3 is specifically expressed in fast-twitch myofibers responsible for generating force at high velocity. The absence of a disease phenotype secondary to alpha-actinin-3 deficiency is likely due to compensation by the homologous protein, alpha-actinin-2. However, the high degree of evolutionary conservation of ACTN3 suggests function(s) independent of ACTN2. Here, we demonstrate highly significant associations between ACTN3 genotype and athletic performance. Both male and female elite sprint athletes have significantly higher frequencies of the 577R allele than do controls. This suggests that the presence of alpha-actinin-3 has a beneficial effect on the function of skeletal muscle in generating forceful contractions at high velocity, and provides an evolutionary advantage because of increased sprint performance. There is also a genotype effect in female sprint and endurance athletes, with higher than expected numbers of 577RX heterozygotes among sprint athletes and lower than expected numbers among endurance athletes. The lack of a similar effect in males suggests that the ACTN3 genotype affects athletic performance differently in males and females. The differential effects in sprint and endurance athletes suggests that the R577X polymorphism may have been maintained in the human population by balancing natural selection.",1

Importantly, the region of acquired DNA loss includes two established tumour suppressor genes, the retinoblastoma gene, RB (RB1) and BRCA2. Resolution of whether RB or BRCA2 is the critical 13q tumour suppressor gene in parathyroid cancer requires analysis of these genes' sequences for intragenic inactivating mutations. Therefore, RB and BRCA2 were analysed in a group of parathyroid carcinomas in which mutations of these genes should be most readily detectable.",1
12840782,"Hypertensive nephropathy (HN) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) are significant causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but no genes or loci have been associated with this phenotype among African Americans, a group at high risk. We performed a genomewide linkage scan with approximately 400 microsatellite markers on 23 individuals of a large four-generation African American family with 18 affected individuals (7 with ESRD), in which the 13-year-old proband (also with ESRD) presented with hypertension and proteinuria (2-4 g/day) and underwent a kidney biopsy that revealed FSGS-like lesions with arteriolar thickening. A genomewide scan revealed LOD scores of >2.5 for markers on chromosomes 3 and 9, and fine mapping was performed on 5 additional members (total 28 members) that showed a maximum multipoint LOD score of 5.4 in the 9q31-q32 region, under an autosomal dominant model with 99% penetrance. This 8-cM (6-Mb) region is flanked by markers D9S172 and D9S105, and further candidate gene sequencing studies excluded the coding regions of three genes (ACTL7A, ACTL7B, and CTNNAL1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a locus, denoted as ""HNP1,"" for the HN/FSGS phenotype in a large African American family with dominantly inherited nephropathy characterized by ESRD, hypertension, and some features of FSGS.",1
12837689,"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a pleiotropic genetic disorder with substantial inter- and intrafamilial variability, that also exhibits remarkable genetic heterogeneity, with seven mapped BBS loci in the human genome. Recent data have demonstrated that BBS may be inherited either as a simple Mendelian recessive or as an oligogenic trait, since mutations at two loci are sometimes required for pathogenesis. This observation suggests that genetic interactions between the different BBS loci may modulate the phenotype, thus contributing to the clinical variability of BBS. We present three families with two mutations in either BBS1 or BBS2, in which some but not all patients carry a third mutation in BBS1, BBS2 or the putative chaperonin BBS6. In each example, the presence of three mutant alleles correlates with a more severe phenotype. For one of the missense alleles, we also demonstrate that the introduction of the mutation in mammalian cells causes a dramatic mislocalization of the protein compared with the wild-type. These data suggest that triallelic mutations are not always necessary for disease manifestation, but might potentiate a phenotype that is caused by two recessive mutations at an independent locus, thus introducing an additional layer of complexity on the genetic modeling of oligogenicity.",1

12809613,"The present paper presents some of the molecular switches that may operate at early embryonic stages to make development of the brainstem respiratory rhythm generator a robust and irreversible process. We concentrate on the role of transient Hox-related gene expression patterns in register with the regionalisation of the rhombencephalic neural tube along the antero-posterior axis. Using different recording and isolation procedures in chick embryos, we show that the hindbrain is subdivided at E1 into developmental units (rhombomeres) intrinsically able to produce rhythm generating neuronal circuits active at E5. At E6, intrinsic cues also allow a progressive maturation of episodic rhythm generators that persists after isolation of the hindbrain in vitro and requires odd/even rhombomeric interactions at E1. From these results and from respiratory pathologies observed in transgenic mice, we are beginning to understand that, despite diversity of breathing patterns and adaptations, there are links between developmental control genes and adult respiration.",0
12802894,"Neuroblastoma belongs to the group of small blue round cell tumors and originates in precursor cells of the sympathetic neural tissue. This tumor occurs at the pediatric age and has fascinated and intrigued both clinicians and researchers because of its variable and often unpredictable clinical behaviour. Indeed, the clinical outcome of neuroblastoma patients not only depends on the clinical extension of the disease, but also on other factors including age at diagnosis, presence or absence in the tumor cells of molecular and biological characteristics with prognostic value (e.g. amplification of the oncogene MYCN, frequently associated with chromosome 1p-deletion is predictive for poor survival chance). In 1983 an abdominal stage 3 neuroblastoma was diagnosed in a 9-months old boy. He died of the disease 3 years later. Karyotyping studies in this patient revealed a constitutional chromosome translocation t(1;17) with a breakpoint involving the terminal part of the chromosome 1p arm. We hypothesized that this patient was predisposed to the development of neuroblastoma because he carried in all his somatic cells a chromosomal abnormality involving the region frequently deleted in neuroblastoma tumor cells. We assumed that the chromosomal translocation breakpoints might indicate the regions harbouring genes involved in neuroblastoma development. A somatic cell fusion experiment was performed between the patient's fibroblasts (the only remaining source of patient material) and a fast growing Chinese hamster ovary cell line to assure the possibilities to perform further research. These somatic cell hybrids indeed contained the human translocation chromosomes. Further characterization of the translocation breakpoints by FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridisation) resulted in the identification of NPPA (formerly PND, the gene for pronatriodilatine) and A12M2 (an adenovirus integration site) as flanking markers for the 1p breakpoint. The 17q breakpoint was located between the NF1 (neurofibromatosis 1) gene and the SCYA7 (harboring the gene encoding the monocyte chemotactic protein-3). Starting from these markers chromosome walking experiments furthered the characterization of the chromosomal breakpoint regions and enabled to identify breakpoint overlapping cosmids. Sequence analysis of these markers is ongoing and will reveal if the breakpoint regions indeed harbour a gene involved in neuroblastoma development.",1

12736709,"A novel human gene denominated TruB pseudouridine (psi) synthase homolog 1 (E. coli) (approved symbol, TRUB1) has been identified and characterized. Spanning approximately 40 kb on chromosome 10 and including 8 exons, TRUB1 is the first described human ortholog of bacterial TruB/psi55, a gene involved in tRNA pseudouridinilation. TRUB1 gene encodes a 349-amino acid product, with a VFAVHKPKGPTSA box in positions 71-83 corresponding to motif I of the TruB family (probably involved in conserving protein structure). The TruB domain of TRUB1 lies between W104 and I255, and contains another short motif, GGTLDS AARGVLVV, including the highly conserved D residue that characterizes motif II (involved in uridine recognition and in catalytic function of psi synthases). Northern blot analysis revealed that TRUB1 mRNA is widely expressed in various human tissues (especially heart, skeletal muscle and liver). Phylogenetic analysis of the TruB domain revealed another human gene (approved symbol TRUB2) encoding a conserved TruB domain, located on human chromosome 9. Thus, the human TruB family includes at least three members: i.e. DKC1 (previously identified), TRUB1 and TRUB2. The TRUB1 and TRUB2 products could be the hitherto unidentified human tRNA psi synthases. Although TRUB1 is not highly similar to DKC1/dyskerin (whose mutations cause X-linked dyskeratosis congenita) and putatively affects tRNA rather than rRNA modification, it is the most similar human protein to dyskerin. Study of TRUB1 (and TRUB2) should facilitate understanding of the molecular mechanisms of RNA modification and the involvement of psi synthases in human pathology, including dyskeratosis-like diseases.",1
12736494,"Ewing's sarcoma (ES) is one of the most malignant bone and soft tissue tumors in childhood. Morphologically, ES belongs to the small round cell tumors (SRCT). ES, peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), and Askin's tumor are classified as ES family tumors (ESFT) because they share a common chromosomal translocation. The EWS-FLI1 chimeric gene is generated by t (11; 22). Other reciprocal translocations resulting in formation of chimeric genes between EWS and ETS family genes (ERG, ETV1, E1AF, and FEV) are t (21; 22), t (7; 22), t (17; 22), and t (2; 22), respectively. Although it is generally difficult to distinguish ES from SRCT, we could easily and quickly distinguish ES from other SRCT by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We looked for specific chimeric genes in 23 tumor samples, including three ES clinical samples. We detected five chimeric genes in the three ES samples. Three chimeric genes, all EWS-FLI1, were detected in one ES sample. Different chimeric genes, EWS-ERG and EWS-ETV1, were detected in the other two ES samples. Moreover, because we could not detect specific chimeric genes in samples from non-ESFT, it may be possible to use this technique to diagnose ESFT and to detect tumor cell contamination before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",1
12730377,"While the fundamental building blocks of biology are being tabulated by the various genome projects, microarray technology is setting the stage for the task of deducing the connectivity of large-scale gene networks. We show how the perturbation of carefully chosen genes in a microarray experiment can be used in conjunction with a reverse engineering algorithm to reveal the architecture of an underlying gene regulatory network. Our iterative scheme identifies the network topology by analyzing the steady-state changes in gene expression resulting from the systematic perturbation of a particular node in the network. We highlight the validity of our reverse engineering approach through the successful deduction of the topology of a linear in numero gene network and a recently reported model for the segmentation polarity network in Drosophila melanogaster. Our method may prove useful in identifying and validating specific drug targets and in deconvolving the effects of chemical compounds.",0
12714972,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by features reminiscent of marked premature ageing. Here, we present evidence of mutations in lamin A (LMNA) as the cause of this disorder. The HGPS gene was initially localized to chromosome 1q by observing two cases of uniparental isodisomy of 1q-the inheritance of both copies of this material from one parent-and one case with a 6-megabase paternal interstitial deletion. Sequencing of LMNA, located in this interval and previously implicated in several other heritable disorders, revealed that 18 out of 20 classical cases of HGPS harboured an identical de novo (that is, newly arisen and not inherited) single-base substitution, G608G(GGC > GGT), within exon 11. One additional case was identified with a different substitution within the same codon. Both of these mutations result in activation of a cryptic splice site within exon 11, resulting in production of a protein product that deletes 50 amino acids near the carboxy terminus. Immunofluorescence of HGPS fibroblasts with antibodies directed against lamin A revealed that many cells show visible abnormalities of the nuclear membrane. The discovery of the molecular basis of this disease may shed light on the general phenomenon of human ageing.",1
12711395,"The genomic organization of cbl genes from a variety of mammalian and non-mammalian species was determined by a combination of cloning and database searches. Humans and mice have three cbl genes (c-cbl,(1) cblb, and cblc) which show remarkable conservation of the intron/exon structure over the region of the genes which encode the highly conserved N-terminal region of the proteins including the RING finger. Searches of genomic, cDNA, and EST databases revealed that one or more cbl genes exist in chordates, insects, and worms. Comparison of the complexity and genomic organization of the cbl gene family and the predicted Cbl proteins from various species suggests that the three mammalian cbl genes arose by two duplications of an ancestral gene. The genomic organization of the cbl genes from various species provides insight into the evolution of the cbl gene family.",1

12700316,"Cervical dystonia (CD) is one of the most common forms of primary dystonia. The pathogenesis of the disease is still unknown, although evidence suggests a role for genetic factors. Recently, a polymorphism in the dopamine D5 receptor (DRD5) gene has been associated with the disease in a British population, suggesting that DRD5 is a susceptibility gene for CD. To confirm these data, we performed a case-control study of the microsatellite (CT/GT/GA)(n) at the DRD5 locus in 104 Italian CD patients and 104 healthy controls. The frequency of allele 4 was higher in the CD patients compared to the controls. This resulted in a twofold increased risk of developing the disease. These results provide further evidence of an association between DRD5 and cervical dystonia, supporting the involvement of the dopamine pathway in the pathogenesis of CD.",1
12695321,"The aim of the present study was to generate hypotheses on the involvement of uncharacterized genes in biological processes. To this end, supervised learning was used to analyze microarray-derived time-series gene expression data. Our method was objectively evaluated on known genes using cross-validation and provided high-precision Gene Ontology biological process classifications for 211 of the 213 uncharacterized genes in the data set used. In addition, new roles in biological process were hypothesized for known genes. Our method uses biological knowledge expressed by Gene Ontology and generates a rule model associating this knowledge with minimal characteristic features of temporal gene expression profiles. This model allows learning and classification of multiple biological process roles for each gene and can predict participation of genes in a biological process even though the genes of this class exhibit a wide variety of gene expression profiles including inverse coregulation. A considerable number of the hypothesized new roles for known genes were confirmed by literature search. In addition, many biological process roles hypothesized for uncharacterized genes were found to agree with assumptions based on homology information. To our knowledge, a gene classifier of similar scope and functionality has not been reported earlier.",0

12621583,"Deletions of 17p13.3, including the LIS1 gene, result in the brain malformation lissencephaly, which is characterized by reduced gyration and cortical thickening; however, the phenotype can vary from isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS) to Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS). At the clinical level, these two phenotypes can be differentiated by the presence of significant dysmorphic facial features and a more severe grade of lissencephaly in MDS. Previous work has suggested that children with MDS have a larger deletion than those with ILS, but the precise boundaries of the MDS critical region and causative genes other than LIS1 have never been fully determined. We have completed a physical and transcriptional map of the 17p13.3 region from LIS1 to the telomere. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have mapped the deletion size in 19 children with ILS, 11 children with MDS, and 4 children with 17p13.3 deletions not involving LIS1. We show that the critical region that differentiates ILS from MDS at the molecular level can be reduced to 400 kb. Using somatic cell hybrids from selected patients, we have identified eight genes that are consistently deleted in patients classified as having MDS. In addition, deletion of the genes CRK and 14-3-3 epsilon delineates patients with the most severe lissencephaly grade. On the basis of recent functional data and the creation of a mouse model suggesting a role for 14-3-3 epsilon in cortical development, we suggest that deletion of one or both of these genes in combination with deletion of LIS1 may contribute to the more severe form of lissencephaly seen only in patients with MDS.",1
12619104,"Based on gene sequence homologies, a p53 (TP53) gene family become apparent with the addition of the most recently identified p63 (TP73L; formerly TP63) and p73 (TP73) genes to the already known p53. The p53 gene encodes for a unique protein eliciting well-known tumor suppressor gene (TSG) properties that mediate cellular response to DNA damage, e.g., cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. In contrast, both homologues specify an array of isoforms different in their N- and C-terminal domains. Transactivating isoforms, such as TAp63/p73, show TSG properties similar to p53, while isoforms lacking N-terminal transactivating domain such as DeltaNp63/p73, induce a functional block against p53 as well as TAp63/p73 activities. Both p63/p73 types of isoforms are involved in development: p63 is critical for epithelial stem cell renewal and epithelial homeostasis, and p73 is involved in neurogenesis and natural immune response. These facts support interdependent functions for the p53 family members, which appear linked together in a complex and tight regulation network to fulfill cellular functions related to DNA damage and tissue homeostasis maintenance. The lack of p63/p73 mutations in human cancers rule out a typical TSG role for either of the p53 homologues. Nonetheless, p63 and p73 genes seem strongly involved in malignancy acquisition and maintenance process because of: 1) their tissue identities, and 2) their close interplay activities within the p53 family members, and primarily through the negative regulatory role played by DeltaNp63/p73 isoforms for cell death control and differentiation.",1
12618766,"The mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL, also known as HRX, ALL-1 and Htrx) located at 11q23 is involved in translocations with over 40 different chromosomal bands in a variety of leukemia subtypes. Here we report our analysis of a rare but recurring translocation, t(11;15)(q23;q14). This translocation has been described in a small subset of cases with both acute myeloblastic leukemia and ALL. Recent studies have shown that MLL is fused to AF15q14 in the t(11;15). Here we analyse a sample from another patient with this translocation and confirm the presence of an MLL-AF15q14 fusion. However, we have also identified and cloned another fusion transcript from the same patient sample. In this fusion transcript, MLL is fused to a novel gene, MLL partner containing FYVE domain (MPFYVE). Both MLL-AF15q14 and MLL-MPFYVE are in-frame fusion transcripts with the potential to code for novel fusion proteins. MPFYVE is also located on chromosome 15, approximately 170 kb telomeric to AF15q14. MPFYVE contains a highly conserved motif, the FYVE domain which, in other proteins, has been shown to bind to phosphotidyl-inositol-3 phosphate (PtdIns(3)P). The MLL-MPFYVE fusion may be functionally important in the leukemia process in at least some patients containing this translocation.",1
12588985,"We have identified a human gene encoding a novel MBD2-interacting protein (MBDin) that contains an N-terminal GTP-binding site, a putative nuclear export signal (NES), and a C-terminal acidic region. MBDin cDNA was isolated through a two-hybrid interaction screening using the methyl-CpG-binding protein MBD2 as bait. The presence of the C-terminal 46-amino-acid region of MBD2 and both the presence of the acidic C-terminal 128-amino-acid region and the integrity of the GTP-binding site of MBDin were required for the interaction. Interaction between MBD2 and MBDin in mammalian cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments. Fluorescence imaging experiments demonstrated that MBDin mainly localizes in the cytoplasm but accumulates in the nucleus upon disruption of the NES or treatment with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of NES-mediated transport. We also found that MBDin partially colocalizes with MBD2 at foci of heavily methylated satellite DNA. An MBD2 deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal region maintained its subnuclear localization but failed to recruit MBDin at hypermethylated foci. Functional analyses demonstrated that MBDin relieves MBD2-mediated transcriptional repression both when Gal4 chimeric constructs and when in vitro-methylated promoter-reporter plasmids were used in transcriptional assays. Southern blotting and bisulfite analysis showed that transcriptional reactivation occurred without changes of the promoter methylation pattern. Our findings suggest the existence of factors that could be targeted on methylated DNA by methyl-CpG-binding proteins reactivating transcription even prior to demethylation.",1
12548287,"Little is known about broad patterns of variation and evolution of gene expression during any developmental process. Here we investigate variation in genome-wide gene expression among Drosophila simulans, Drosophila yakuba and four strains of Drosophila melanogaster during a major developmental transition--the start of metamorphosis. Differences in gene activity between these lineages follow a phylogenetic pattern, and 27% of all of the genes in these genomes differ in their developmental gene expression between at least two strains or species. We identify, on a gene-by-gene basis, the evolutionary forces that shape this variation and show that, both within the transcriptional network that controls metamorphosis and across the whole genome, the expression changes of transcription factor genes are relatively stable, whereas those of their downstream targets are more likely to have evolved. Our results demonstrate extensive evolution of developmental gene expression among closely related species.",0
12545816,"The aim of the present study was to determine whether p16 gene is involved in the genesis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Twenty-five primary HCC tumor and corresponding non-tumor liver tissue specimens were examined for P16 gene alterations. The identification of deletion of p16 gene exon 1 and exon 2 was performed using comparative multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The point mutation of p16 gene exon 2 was investigated by single strand conformational polymorphism(SSCP) analysis, and the status of p16 gene methylation was screened using PCR-based methylation analysis. Moreover, 35 parafin specimens of primary HCCs with corresponding non-tumor liver tissues, including the 25 cases described above for screening of p16 gene alterations, were investigated also for P16 protein expression by using immunohistochemical analysis. The results of comparative multiplex PCR analysis showed that 12% (3/25) p16 gene deletions, including homozygous deletions in 2 tumors and hemizygous deletion in 1 tumor, were found in the primary HCCs samples. No point mutation was identified in the remaining 22 tumor samples without p16 gene deletions by using SSCP analysis. Hypermethylation was detected in 24% (6/25) of tumor samples by PCR-based analysis. However the corresponding non-tumor liver tissue specimens were always unmethylated at p16 locus. Loss of P16 protein expression, detected by immunohistochemistry, occurred in 16 of 35 (45.7%) tumor samples, whereas all the non-tumor liver tissue specimens showed positive p16 staining. These results indicate that inactivation of p16 gene is relevant to the genesis of HCC.",1
12542482,"The BCR-ABL-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD) and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD) are a spectrum of related conditions for which the molecular pathogenesis is poorly understood. Translocations that disrupt and constitutively activate the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta(PDGFRB) gene at chromosome band 5q33 have been described in some patients, the most common being the t(5;12)(q33;p13). An accurate molecular diagnosis of PDGFRB-rearranged patients has become increasingly important since recent data have indicated that they respond very well to imatinib mesylate therapy. In this study, we have tested nine patients with a CMPD or MDS/MPD and a translocation involving 5q31-33 for disruption of PDGFRB by two-colour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using differentially labelled, closely flanking probes. Normal control interphase cells gave a false positive rate of 3% (signals more than one signal width apart). Six patients showed a pattern of one fused signal (from the normal allele) and one pair of signals separated by more than one signal width in > 85% of interphase cells, indicating that PDGFRB was disrupted. These individuals had a t(1;5)(q21;q33), t(1;5)(q22;q31), t(1;3;5)(p36;p21;q33), t(2;12;5)(q37;q22;q33), t(3;5) (p21;q31) and t(5;14)(q33;q24) respectively. The remaining three patients with a t(1;5)(q21;q31), t(2;5)(p21;q33) and t(5;6)(q33;q24-25) showed a normal pattern of hybridization, with > or = 97% interphase cells with two fusion signals. We conclude that two-colour FISH is useful to determine the presence of a PDGFRB rearrangement, although, as we have shown previously, this technique may not detect subtle complex translocations at this locus. Our data indicate that several PDGFRB partner genes remain to be characterized.",1
12503720,"The pathophysiological mechanisms of weaning from mechanical ventilation are not fully known, but there is accumulating evidence that mechanical ventilation induces inspiratory muscle dysfunction. Recently, several animal models have provided potential mechanisms for mechanical ventilation-induced effects on muscle function. In patients, weaning difficulties are associated with inspiratory muscle weakness and reduced endurance capacity. Animal studies demonstrated that diaphragm force was already decreased after 12 h of controlled mechanical ventilation and this worsened with time spent on the ventilator. Diaphragmatic myofibril damage observed after 3-days controlled mechanical ventilation was inversely correlated with maximal diaphragmatic force. Downregulation of the diaphragm insulin-like growth factor-I and MyoD/myogenin messenger ribonucleic acid occurred after 24 h and diaphragmatic oxidative stress and increased protease activity after 18 h. In keeping with these findings, diaphragm fibre atrophy was shown after 12 h and reduced diaphragm mass was reported after 48 h of controlled mechanical ventilation. These animal studies show that early alterations in diaphragm function develop after short-term mechanical ventilation. These alterations may contribute to the difficulties in weaning from mechanical ventilation seen in patients. Strategies to preserve respiratory muscle mass and function during mechanical ventilation should be developed. These may include: adaptation of medication, training of the diaphragm, stabilisation of the catabolic state and pharmacotherapy.",0
12503107,"Congenital generalized hypertrichosis terminalis has been described in association with other features as gingival hyperplasia, osteochondrodysplasia, and a dysmorphic face.

We present an 11-year, 6-month-old girl with universal congenital hypertrichosis terminalis, gingival hyperplasia, and a characteristic coarse face resembling the patient described by Bondeson and Miles [1993: Am J Med Genet 47:198-212].

Several parameters (nucleotide composition, dinucletoide content bias) proved to correlate with expression level, each functional region having its specific features. Context optimization of a functional region was assumed to be essential for highly efficient interaction with the expression system of the cell. Specific context features were considered as dispersed signals important for high-level gene expression.",0
12496757,"Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS; OMIM 260400) is an autosomal recessive disorder with clinical features that include pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, hematological dysfunction and skeletal abnormalities. Here, we report identification of disease-associated mutations in an uncharacterized gene, SBDS, in the interval of 1.9 cM at 7q11 previously shown to be associated with the disease. We report that SBDS has a 1.6-kb transcript and encodes a predicted protein of 250 amino acids. A pseudogene copy (SBDSP) with 97% nucleotide sequence identity resides in a locally duplicated genomic segment of 305 kb. We found recurring mutations resulting from gene conversion in 89% of unrelated individuals with SDS (141 of 158), with 60% (95 of 158) carrying two converted alleles. Converted segments consistently included at least one of two pseudogene-like sequence changes that result in protein truncation. SDBS is a member of a highly conserved protein family of unknown function with putative orthologs in diverse species including archaea and eukaryotes. Archaeal orthologs are located within highly conserved operons that include homologs of RNA-processing genes, suggesting that SDS may be caused by a deficiency in an aspect of RNA metabolism that is essential for development of the exocrine pancreas, hematopoiesis and chrondrogenesis.",1
12483300,"Pericentromeric regions of human chromosomes are preferential sites for the integration of duplicated DNA, or ""duplicons"", which often contain gene fragments. Although pericentromeric regions appear to be genomic junkyards, they could also be the birthplace of new genes with novel functions. We have characterized a chimeric transcription unit (cat eye syndrome critical region gene 7, CECR7) formed from three duplicons in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 22q. CECR7 exons show similarity to sequences on chromosomes 2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, and elsewhere on 22. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of CECR7 duplicon boundaries in various primate species, and the sequence divergence between the human duplicons and their putative ancestral human loci, CECR7 was probably formed before the separation of macaque and is therefore older than most previously reported pericentromeric duplicons. Expression of CECR7 was detected by RT-PCR in humans and gorilla fibroblasts, but not orangutan, suggesting that expression did not result immediately from the formation of this novel transcription unit, or that expression was silenced in orangutan following its formation.",1
12470336,"The development of the mammalian germ line has been well studied, from the designation of primordial germ cells and their migration in the embryo to their progression through gametogenesis. The pattern of germ cell development, as established through classical studies, is now being overlaid with molecular, genetic and epigenetic data. Eventually, proteonomics will lead to a deeper understanding of the function of these genes. Through knowledge of germ cell gene expression patterns, it is now possible to develop transgenic molecular tools for the isolation of germ cells at different stages of development. By linking stage-specific germ cell promoter regions to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene it is possible to tag these cells genetically for histological identification and cell sorting. Our long-term goal is to develop male germ cells as stem cells for therapeutic purposes.

Alkylation of DNA at the O6 position of guanine is the first step by alkylating agents in inducing DNA mutations in an organism. When MGMT and the mismatch repair (MMR) system are impaired, O6-methylguanine mispairs with thymine during DNA replication, resulting in a G:C right curved arrow A:T transitional mutation in DNA. We obtained cancer lesions by manual micro-dissection (MMD) from 26 paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed gallbladder carcinoma and Laser Capture Micro-dissection (LCM) method from 10 fresh frozen specimens. Mutation analysis was performed on the micro-dissected samples for K-ras and beta-catenin genes. At codon 12 of the K-ras gene, the MMD and LCM methods detected mutations in 3 (11.5%) and 1 (10%) case, respectively. In exon 3 of beta-catenin gene, only 1 (3.8%) case revealed a mutation in MMD cancer foci. Two cases without MGMT or MMR expression revealed a G right curved arrow A transition mutation in the K-ras gene. The findings suggested that negative MGMT and MMR status contributed to a G:C right curved arrow A:T transitional mutation in the K-ras gene. However, K-ras and beta-catenin mutations were actually rare in GB carcinoma. Other gene mutations frequently occurring in gallbladder carcinoma might be affected by this negative MGMT and MMR status.",1
12461749,"We have systematically retrieved genes with coding mononucleotide repeats from sequence databases and analyzed them for mutations in tumors with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H). We found somatic frameshift mutations in 7/13 genes previously not analyzed in MSI-H tumors. According to the frequency of mutations in MSI-H tumors, these genes could be divided into genes with high coding mononucleotide repeat instability (CMRI-H) and genes with low coding mononucleotide instability (CMRI-L). CMR-H genes were mutated in more than 9/38 and CMRI-L in less than 4/38 of MSI-H tumors. Four genes in our study were CMRI-H and could thus possibly play a role in the development of MSI-H tumors: TFE3 (9/38), TEF4 (12/38), RGS12 (11/38), and TCF1 (12/38). Our results suggest that systematic identification of genes with CMR in the sequence databases and determination of mutation frequency in MSI-H tumors might be a powerful tool for identification of new molecular targets in the development of MSI-H tumors.",1

12433584,"Evolutionary analysis of the content of developmental regulatory pathways has been advanced by the publication of pairs of complete genome sequences from representative taxonomic groups. Annotation of the fission yeast, rice, and mouse genomes confirms that most regulatory families are shared among eukaryotes but also shows that certain gene families have restricted distributions. Theoretical advances in the past few years include development of the theory of scale-free networks, which provides a new framework in which to consider the connectivity and evolution of regulatory systems, and introduction of algorithms that use comparative data to enhance detection of transcriptional regulatory motifs.",0
12432407,"A central focus of postgenomic research will be to understand how cellular phenomena arise from the connectivity of genes and proteins. This connectivity generates molecular network diagrams that resemble complex electrical circuits, and a systematic understanding will require the development of a mathematical framework for describing the circuitry. From an engineering perspective, the natural path towards such a framework is the construction and analysis of the underlying submodules that constitute the network. Recent experimental advances in both sequencing and genetic engineering have made this approach feasible through the design and implementation of synthetic gene networks amenable to mathematical modelling and quantitative analysis. These developments have signalled the emergence of a gene circuit discipline, which provides a framework for predicting and evaluating the dynamics of cellular processes. Synthetic gene networks will also lead to new logical forms of cellular control, which could have important applications in functional genomics, nanotechnology, and gene and cell therapy.",0
12429059,"The current speed of sequencing already exceeds the capability of annotation, creating a potential bottleneck. A large proportion of the genes in microbial genomes remains uncharacterized. Here we propose a new method for functional annotation using the conservation patterns of gene clusters. If several gene clusters show the same coevolution pattern across different genomes it is reasonable to infer they are functionally related. The gene cluster phylogenetic profile integrates chromosomal proximity information and phylogenetic profile information and allows us to infer functional dependences between the gene clusters even at great distance on the chromosome.",0
12413821,"An increasingly popular model of regulation is to represent networks of genes as if they directly affect each other. Although such gene networks are phenomenological because they do not explicitly represent the proteins and metabolites that mediate cell interactions, they are a logical way of describing phenomena observed with transcription profiling, such as those that occur with popular microarray technology. The ability to create gene networks from experimental data and use them to reason about their dynamics and design principles will increase our understanding of cellular function. We propose that gene networks are also a good way to describe function unequivocally, and that they could be used for genome functional annotation. Here, we review some of the concepts and methods associated with gene networks, with emphasis on their construction based on experimental data.",0

12402504,"A common view within the pharmaceutical industry is that there is a problem with drug discovery and we should do something about it. There is much sympathy for this from academics, regulators and politicians. In this article I propose that lessons learnt from evolution help identify those factors that favour successful drug discovery. This personal view is influenced by a decade spent reviewing drug development programmes submitted for European regulatory approval. During the prolonged gestation of a new medicine few candidate molecules survive. This process of elimination of many variants and the survival of so few has much in common with evolution, an analogy that encourages discussion of the forces that favour, and those that hinder, successful drug discovery. Imagining a world without vaccines, anaesthetics, contraception and anti-infectives reveals how medicines revolutionized humanity. How to manipulate conditions that favour such discoveries is worth consideration.",0
12395297,"Duane syndrome is a congenital eye movement disorder characterized most typically by absence of abduction, restricted adduction, and retraction of the globe on attempted adduction. Duane syndrome can be coinherited with radial ray anomalies as an autosomal dominant trait, referred to as ""Okihiro syndrome"" or ""Duane radial ray syndrome"" (DRRS). We ascertained three pedigrees with DRRS and mapped their disease gene to a 21.6-cM region of chromosome 20 flanked by markers D20S888 and D20S102. A new member of the SAL family of proposed C(2)H(2) zinc finger transcription factors, SALL4, falls within the region. Mutation analysis of SALL4 in the three pedigrees revealed one nonsense and two frameshift heterozygous mutations. SALL4 represents the first identified Duane syndrome gene and the second malformation syndrome resulting from mutations in SAL genes and likely plays a critical role in abducens motoneuron development.",1

Involvement of epistatic genes in genetic control of all the traits excluding the panicle density was established. By analysing the diallel tables with excluded data from the varieties with epistatic genes, it was revealed that hyperdominance is inherent to genetic control of the majority of traits studied. The dominant gene action exceeds the additive gene action. The genes ""u"" increasing the phenotypic displaying of the trait are always dominant and their frequency in the variety set under consideration is higher than the frequency of the genes ""v"" for all traits studied.",0
12378528,"Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) is a soft-tissue neoplasm cytogenetically characterized by the translocations t(9;22)(q22;q11-12) or t(9;17)(q22;q11), generating EWS/CHN or RBP56/CHN fusion genes, respectively. In the present study, 18 EMCs were studied both cytogenetically and at the molecular level. Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 16 samples: 13 with involvement of 9q22 and 22q11-12, and three with rearrangements of 9q22 and 17q11. Fifteen cases had an EWS/CHN fusion transcript and three had an RBP56/CHN transcript. The most frequent EWS/CHN transcript (type 1; 10 tumors), involved fusion of EWS exon 12 with CHN exon 3, and the second most common (type 5; two cases) was fusion of EWS exon 13 with CHN exon 3. In all tumors with RBP56/CHN fusion, exon 6 of RBP56 was fused to exon 3 of CHN. By genomic XL PCR and sequence analyses, the breakpoints from 14 cases were mapped in the EWS, RBP56, and CHN genes. In CHN, 12 breakpoints were found in intron 2 and only two in intron 1. In EWS, the breaks occurred in introns 7 (one break), 12 (eight breaks), and 13 (one break), and in RBP56 in intron 6. Repetitive elements such as Alu and LINE sequences seem to have limited, if any, importance in the genesis of EWS/CHN and RBP56/CHN chimeras. Furthermore, there were no chi, chi-like, topoisomerase II, or translin consensus sequences in the introns harboring the translocation breakpoints, nor could the number of topo I sites in EWS, RBP56, and CHN introns explain the uneven distribution of the breakpoints among EWS or CHN introns. Additional genetic events, such as nucleotide insertions, homologies at the junction, deletions, duplications, and inversions, were found to accompany the translocations, indicating that the chromosomal translocations do not require sequence-specific recombinases or extensive homology between the recombined sequences.",1

12364463,"There is strong evidence in many tumor types, including thyroid cancer, for a novel tumor suppressor gene (TSG) at 17p13. To identify the putative thyroid 17p13 TSG we mapped thyroid tumor loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at high resolution within this region. We examined 20 typical follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTC), 19 Hurthle cell carcinomas (HCC), 15 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), and 7 follicular adenomas (FA) for LOH at 17p13 using 18 probes. Complete clinical follow-up data were available for all patients. We confirmed a high 17p13 LOH rate in FTC (18 of 20) and HCC (13 of 19) and showed an association between 17p13 LOH and advanced tumor grade. Only 4 of 15 PTC and 1 of 7 FA displayed 17p13 LOH. In the HCC we identified a narrow minimal common deleted region between D17S1308 (285 kb from the p-telomer) and D17S695 (696 kb from the p-telomer). This region was flanked centromerically by a breakpoint cluster, further suggesting nonrandom deletion. All but 1 of the PTC and FA with 17p LOH and 50% of the affected FTC also showed LOH in this region. These data suggest that a TSG, involved in HCC pathogenesis, is contained within the D17S1308-D17S695 interval. There are several potential candidate TSGs in this region that are worthy of further study.",1
12355087,"The gene PTTG1 (encoding the pituitary tumor-transforming 1 protein) is overexpressed in several different tumor types, is tumorigenic in vivo and shows transcriptional activity. The PTTG1 protein is cell-cycle regulated and was identified as the human securin (a category of proteins involved in the regulation of sister-chromatid separation) on the basis of biochemical similarities with the Pds1p protein of budding yeast and the Cut2p protein of fission yeast. To unravel the function of human securin in oncogenesis, we carried out a phage-display screening to identify proteins that interact with securin. Notably, we isolated the p53 tumor suppressor. Pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that p53 interacts specifically with securin both in vitro and in vivo. This interaction blocks the specific binding of p53 to DNA and inhibits its transcriptional activity. Securin also inhibits the ability of p53 to induce cell death. Moreover, we observed that transfection of H1299 cells with securin induced an accumulation of G2 cells that compensated for the loss of G2 cells caused by transfection with p53. We demonstrated the physiological relevance of this interaction in PTTG1-deficient human tumor cells (PTTG1(-/-)): both apoptotic and transactivating functions of p53 were potentiated in these cells compared to parental cells. We propose that the oncogenic effect of increased expression of securin may result from modulation of p53 functions.",1
12325482,"In addition to evidence of the vital reaction it is important from the forensic aspect to assess the age of wounds, in particular in wounds with a short time of survival. To both can contribute detection of adhesive molecules, identified in recent years, possibly in combination with other markers of early stages of reparative inflammation. The submitted paper comprises the results of investigation of 465 skin wounds. The investigated samples were obtained from necroptic material, excision from wounds of treated patients and from experimental injuries in mice. Assessment of the age of injuries by means of endothelial adhesive molecules was made in paraffin sections after transfer into Varioclave and using the ABC techniqueref.. In human material a strong positive reaction of ICAM-1 was observed first after 1 and a half hours and latest after 3 and a half days, in P-selectin first after 3 mins., latest after 7 hours, in E-selectin first after 1 hour and latest after 17 days, in VCAM-1 first after 3 hours and latest 3 and a half days after the development of the injury. Expression of L-selectin was not typical for the injury. In skin injuries of mice positive immunohistochemical reactions were found as a rule sooner than in skin injuries of humans. Fibronectin was detected in paraffin sections from 70 skin wounds of dissected subjects immunohistochemically by the indirect immunoperoxidase reaction and by the use of the ABC technique labelled with alkaline phosphatase. Positive evidence was observed first after 5 minutes and latest after 8 hours.",0
12202501,"It is known that the pRb pathway cell-cycle inhibitor p16(INK4A) plays a significant role in cutaneous melanoma and that alteration of p16(INK4A), which resides within the 9p21-22 locus that also contains p15(INK4B) and p14(ARF), may occur in up to one third of uveal melanomas. The absence of TGFbeta responsiveness noted in cultured uveal melanoma cells also suggests that the TGFbeta pathway plays a role in the formation of this tumor. Therefore, mutational screening was performed in several key genes in tumor-suppressor pathways that are known to be altered in some uveal melanomas.",1
12181274,"Some investigators have reported that the histological features of osteosarcoma (OS) arising in elderly patients are different from those in younger patients; however, a molecular biologic study of OS in elderly patients has not been documented. In this study, 23 cases of OS (15 osteoblastic and 8 MFH-like types) and 18 cases of MFH of bone in patients 40 years of age or older were analyzed for mutation of the p53 gene, amplification of the MDM2 gene, and mutation of the H-ras gene, using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded materials. We also examined the expression of p53, MDM2, and p21WAF1 protein immunohistochemically and assessed the proliferative activities using the monoclonal antibody MIB-1. p53 immunoreactivity was recognized in 5 of 23 OS cases (22%), whereas p53 gene mutations were also detected in 5 of 23 OS cases (22%; osteoblastic [4/15; 27%] and MFH-like [1/8; 18%] types) and in 4 of 18 cases of MFH of bone (22%). There was a statistically significant correlation between p53 immunoreactivity and p53 mutation status in OS (P =.0482). All those cases of osteoblastic OS and MFH of bone that had p53 mutations, with the exception of one case of MFH of bone that had a silent mutation, showed aggressive biologic behavior (dead of disease within 12 mo), in contrast to the MFH-like OS cases (alive without disease at 22 mo). Three cases of OS (13%) and three cases of MFH of bone (17%) showed immunoreactivity for MDM2. As for gene alteration, three cases of OS (13%) and 3 cases of MFH of bone (17%) demonstrated MDM2 amplification. MDM2 amplification showed a significant correlation with the expression of MDM2 protein in OS (P =.0344). p21WAF1 expression was detected in three cases of OS (13%) and in six cases of MFH of bone (33%). MDM2 alteration and p21WAF1 expression were not observed in any of the cases of MFH-like OS. MIB-1-LI showed a statistically significant correlation with p53 immunoreactivity and MDM2 immunoreactivity in OS (P =.0307 and P =.0358, respectively). H-ras mutation at Codons 12 and 13 was not recognized in any of the cases of OS or MFH of bone. In conclusion, although treatment differences during the time of study make it difficult to compare survival analysis, in the current study, p53 mutation in osteoblastic OS and MFH of bone in elderly patients seemed to be closely associated with the progression of the tumor, which was not the case in MFH-like OS. Furthermore, MDM2 alteration and p21WAF1 expression were demonstrated only in osteoblastic OS and MFH of bone, whereas they were not recognized in MFH-like OS. Although the number of patients in this analysis was small, it would appear that MFH-like OS may have some characteristic biologic aspects when compared with osteoblastic OS and MFH of bone in elderly patients.",1
12175345,"Supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumours (sPNETs) are malignant central nervous system tumours of childhood which are histologically characterized by poorly differentiated neuroepithelial cells with the capacity for divergent differentiation into glial, neuronal, myogenic or melanotic lines. The histological differential diagnosis between sPNET and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) may be difficult, particularly as GBMs can sometimes demonstrate a poorly differentiated PNET-like phenotype. To identify molecular genetic markers that may distinguish sPNET and GBM, we investigated 12 cerebral sPNETs and six GBMs from paediatric patients for genetic alterations of the TP53, PTEN, CDKN2A, EGFR, CDK4 and MDM2 genes, as well as for allelic loss on chromosome arms 10q and 17p. Mutations of the TP53 tumour suppressor gene were found in one of 12 sPNETs (8%) and two of six GBMs (33%). None of the sPNETs but two of six GBMs (33%, including one GBM with a TP53 mutation) showed allelic losses on chromosome arm 17p. PTEN mutations were detected in one of 12 sPNET (8%) and one of six GBMs (17%). None of the sPNETs and GBMs carried a homozygous deletion involving the CDKN2A tumour suppressor gene. No amplification of the EGFR, CDK4 or MDM2 proto-oncogenes was detected. Taken together, our results indicate that paediatric GBMs differ from sPNETs by a higher incidence of allelic losses on 17p and TP53 mutations. In addition, the patterns of genetic alterations in sPNETs and paediatric GBMs appear to be distinct from those in cerebellar medulloblastomas and adult GBMs, respectively.",1
12169732,"Primate-specific segmental duplications are considered important in human disease and evolution. The inability to distinguish between allelic and duplication sequence overlap has hampered their characterization as well as assembly and annotation of our genome. We developed a method whereby each public sequence is analyzed at the clone level for overrepresentation within a whole-genome shotgun sequence. This test has the ability to detect duplications larger than 15 kilobases irrespective of copy number, location, or high sequence similarity. We mapped 169 large regions flanked by highly similar duplications. Twenty-four of these hot spots of genomic instability have been associated with genetic disease. Our analysis indicates a highly nonrandom chromosomal and genic distribution of recent segmental duplications, with a likely role in expanding protein diversity.",0
12162508,"Mechanical loading presents a potent osteogenic stimulus to bone cells, but bone cells desensitize rapidly to mechanical stimulation. Resensitization must occur before the cells can transduce future mechanical signals effectively. Previous experiments show that mechanical loading protocols are more osteogenic if the load cycles are divided into several discrete bouts, separated by several hours, than if the cycles are applied in a single uninterrupted bout. We investigated the effect of discrete mechanical loading bouts on structure and biomechanical properties of the rat ulna after 16 weeks of loading. The right ulnas of 26 adult female rats were subjected to 360 load cycles/day, delivered in a haversine waveform at 17 N peak force, 3 days/week for 16 weeks. One-half of the animals (n = 13) were administered all 360 daily cycles in a single uninterrupted bout (360 x 1); the other half were administered 90 cycles four times per day (90 x 4), with 3 h between bouts. A nonloaded baseline control (BLC) group and an age-matched control (AMC) group (n = 9/group) were included in the experiment. The following measurements were collected after death: in situ mechanical strain at the ulna midshaft; ulnar length; maximum and minimum second moments of area (I(MAx) and I(MIN)) along the entire length of the ulnas (1-mm increments); and ultimate force, energy to failure, and stiffness of whole ulnas. Qualitative observations of bone morphology were made from whole bone images reconstructed from microcomputed tomography (microCT) slices. Loading according to the 360 x 1 and 90 x 4 schedules improved ultimate force by 64% and 87%, energy to failure by 94% and 165%, I(MAX) by 13% and 26% (in the middistal diaphysis), I(MIN) by 69% and 96% (in the middistal diaphysis), and reduced peak mechanical strain by 40% and 36%, respectively. The large increases in biomechanical properties occurred despite very low 5-12% gains in areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and bone mineral content (BMC). Mechanical loading is more effective in enhancing bone biomechanical and structural properties if the loads are applied in discrete bouts, separated by recovery periods (90 x 4 schedule), than if the loads are applied in a single session (360 x 1). Modest increases in aBMD and BMC can improve biomechanical properties substantially if the new bone formation is localized to the most biomechanically relevant sites, as occurs during load-induced bone formation.",1

12139437,"It is known that while the programs used to find genes in prokaryotic genomes reliably map protein-coding regions, they often fail in the exact determination of gene starts. This problem is further aggravated by sequencing errors, most notably insertions and deletions leading to frame-shifts. Therefore, the exact mapping of gene starts and identification of frame-shifts are important problems of the computer-assisted functional analysis of newly sequenced genomes. Here we review methods of gene recognition and describe a new algorithm for correction of gene starts and identification of frame-shifts in prokaryotic genomes. The algorithm is based on the comparison of nucleotide and protein sequences of homologous genes from related organisms, using the assumption that the rate of evolutionary changes in protein-coding regions is lower than that in non-coding regions. A dynamic programming algorithm is used to align protein sequences obtained by formal translation of genomic nucleotide sequences. The possibility of frame-shifts is taken into account. The algorithm was tested on several groups of related organisms: gamma-proteobacteria, the Bacillus/Clostridium group, and three Pyrococcus genomes. The testing demonstrated that, dependent or a genome, 1-10 per cent of genes have incorrect starts or contain frame-shifts. The algorithm is implemented in the program package Orthologator-GeneCorrector.",0
12124347,"Microsatellite instability (MSI) is observed in a subset of endometrial cancers (ECs) and is attributed to defects in mismatch repair. Mismatch repair deficiency allows for accumulation of mutations in the coding repeats of key target genes, which may be involved in the initiation and progression of MSI+ EC. We examined genes implicated in DNA repair pathways in 38 MSI-high (MSI-H), 10 MSI-low, 25 microsatellite stable ECs, and a selected panel of associated premalignant hyperplasias. Genetic alterations were correlated to histopathological data, including tumor grade and stage. Somatic frameshift mutations were observed in hMLH3, hMSH3, hMSH6, CHK1, and BAX genes in MSI-H endometrial hyperplasias and cancers, whereas mutations in ATR and CDC25C were observed only in MSI-H ECs. Increased mutation frequency in DNA damage response pathway genes including ATR, CHK1, and BAX demonstrated a significant trend with advancing tumor grade (P < 0.05). Our observations of the same mutations at short coding mononucleotide repeats in both premalignant lesions and tumors and association of increased frequency of mutation accumulation with advancing tumor grade suggest that these alterations may play a role in the development and progression of MSI+ EC.",1

12118324,"To determine the etiologic factors of human oral cancer, we examined the prevalence of microsatellite instability (MSI), the inactivation of mismatch repair (MMR) genes, p53 mutation, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (HPV-16, -18, and -33) in 86 Korean oral cancer specimens, including 76 squamous cell carcinomas and 10 salivary gland tumors. MSI was observed in 3 of the 76 squamous cell carcinomas (4%) and 2 of 10 salivary gland tumors (20%). As MSI is a hallmark of the inactivation of the MMR genes, the genetic status of hMSH2 and hMLH1, and hypermethylation of the hMLH1 promoter region were investigated in oral cancers displaying MSI. Inactivation of the hMLH1 gene by either mutation or hypermethylation was observed 4 of the 5 MSI oral cancers. Mutation of the p53 gene was found in 11 of 76 squamous cell carcinomas (14.5%) but not in the salivary gland tumors. PCR assay revealed the presence of HPV DNA in 11 of the 76 squamous cell carcinomas (14.5%) and 4 of the 10 salivary gland tumors (40%). Type 18 HPV DNA was predominant in 11 of the HPV-infected squamous cell carcinomas (72.7%) and 4 of the HPV-infected salivary gland tumors (50%). Two squamous cell carcinoma tissues were found both to be HPV-infected and to harbor the p53 mutation. Our results suggest: i) that MSI plays a role in the pathogenesis of Korean oral cancers, squamous cell carcinomas (4%) and salivary gland tumors (20%); ii) that genetic alteration or hypermethylation of the hMLH1 gene may be the principal inactivating mechanism in Korean oral cancer with MSI; and iii) that inactivation of the p53 gene by either mutation or HPV infection is frequent in Korean squamous cell carcinomas (26%) and salivary gland tumors (40%).",1
12080385,"Usher syndrome type 3 (USH3) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by the association of post-lingual progressive hearing loss, progressive visual loss due to retinitis pigmentosa and variable presence of vestibular dysfunction. Because the previously defined transcripts do not account for all USH3 cases, we performed further analysis and revealed the presence of additional exons embedded in longer human and mouse USH3A transcripts and three novel USH3A mutations. Expression of Ush3a transcripts was localised by whole mount in situ hybridisation to cochlear hair cells and spiral ganglion cells. The full length USH3A transcript encodes clarin-1, a four-transmembrane-domain protein, which defines a novel vertebrate-specific family of three paralogues. Limited sequence homology to stargazin, a cerebellar synapse four-transmembrane-domain protein, suggests a role for clarin-1 in hair cell and photoreceptor cell synapses, as well as a common pathophysiological pathway for different Usher syndromes.",1
12060689,"Gene identification, also known as gene finding or gene recognition, is among the important problems of molecular biology that have been receiving increasing attention with the advent of large scale sequencing projects. Previous strategies for solving this problem can be categorized into essentially two schools of thought: one school employs sequence composition statistics, whereas the other relies on database similarity searches. In this paper, we propose a new gene identification scheme that combines the best characteristics from each of these two schools. In particular, our method determines gene candidates among the ORFs that can be identified in a given DNA strand through the use of the Bio-Dictionary, a database of patterns that covers essentially all of the currently available sample of the natural protein sequence space. Our approach relies entirely on the use of redundant patterns as the agents on which the presence or absence of genes is predicated and does not employ any additional evidence, e.g. ribosome-binding site signals. The Bio-Dictionary Gene Finder (BDGF), the algorithm's implementation, is a single computational engine able to handle the gene identification task across distinct archaeal and bacterial genomes. The engine exhibits performance that is characterized by simultaneous very high values of sensitivity and specificity, and a high percentage of correctly predicted start sites. Using a collection of patterns derived from an old (June 2000) release of the Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL database that contained 451 602 proteins and fragments, we demonstrate our method's generality and capabilities through an extensive analysis of 17 complete archaeal and bacterial genomes. Examples of previously unreported genes are also shown and discussed in detail.",0
12060387,"Primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas represent a distinct group of lymphoproliferative disorders that can be distinguished from systemic lymphoma by their good response to local treatment and favorable prognosis. In systemic B cell lymphoma, inactivation of p15(INK4b) and p16(INK4a) is frequently observed and may be associated with a poor prognosis. There have been no comprehensive studies in primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas, however. Mechanisms of p15/p16 inactivation include loss of heterozygosity, homozygous deletion, promotor region hypermethylation, and point mutation. We analyzed DNA from 36 cases of primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas, four systemic B cell lymphomas, and six benign B cell lymphoproliferative infiltrates for abnormalities of p15 and p16 using microsatellite markers for 9p21, methylation specific polymerase chain reaction, and polymerase chain reaction/single stranded conformational polymorphism analysis with exon specific primers. Expression of both p15 and p16 protein was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Loss of heterozygosity at 9p21 was identified in 2 out of 36 primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas. Hypermethylation of p15 and p16 promotor regions was identified in 8 of 35 (23%) and 15 of 35 (43%) cases, respectively. In two cases p16 hypermethylation was identified in recurrent disease but not in the initial tumor. No point mutations were identified. In seven patients, however, a polymorphism was observed in exon 3 of the p16 gene. In primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas with allelic loss or promotor hypermethylation of either p15 or p16, loss of expression in tumor cells was identified in 5 of 8 and 9 of 10 cases, respectively. Our findings suggest that p15(INK4b) and p16(INK4a) biallelic gene abnormalities are common in primary cutaneous B cell lymphomas, most frequently as a result of promotor hypermethylation. The presence of abnormalities in recurrent disease in some cases suggests that inactivation of p15 and p16 may be involved in disease progression.",1
12058348,"Multiple-lentigines (ML)/LEOPARD (multiple lentigines, electrocardiographic-conduction abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonary stenosis, abnormal genitalia, retardation of growth, and sensorineural deafness) syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition--characterized by lentigines and café au lait spots, facial anomalies, cardiac defects--that shares several clinical features with Noonan syndrome (NS). We screened nine patients with ML/LEOPARD syndrome (including a mother-daughter pair) and two children with NS who had multiple café au lait spots, for mutations in the NS gene, PTPN11, and found, in 10 of 11 patients, one of two new missense mutations, in exon 7 or exon 12. Both mutations affect the PTPN11 phosphotyrosine phosphatase domain, which is involved in <30% of the NS PTPN11 mutations. The study demonstrates that ML/LEOPARD syndrome and NS are allelic disorders. The detected mutations suggest that distinct molecular and pathogenetic mechanisms cause the peculiar cutaneous manifestations of the ML/LEOPARD-syndrome subtype of NS.",1
12058346,"Griscelli syndrome (GS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder, is characterized by partial albinism, along with immunologic abnormalities or severe neurological impairment or both. Mutations in one of two different genes on chromosome 15q can cause the different subtypes of GS. Most patients with GS display the hemophagocytic syndrome and have mutations in RAB27A, which codes for a small GTPase. Two patients with neurological involvement have mutations in MYO5A, which codes for an actin-based molecular motor. The RAB27A and MYO5A gene products interact with each other and function in vesicle trafficking. We report the molecular basis of GS in a Muslim Arab kindred whose members have extremely variable neurological involvement, along with the hemophagocytic syndrome and immunologic abnormalities. The patients have normal MYO5A genes but exhibit a homozygous 67.5-kb deletion that eliminates RAB27A mRNA and immunocytofluorescence-detectable protein. We also describe the molecular organization of RAB27A and a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay for the founder deletion in this kindred. Finally, we propose that all patients with GS have RAB27A mutations and immunologic abnormalities that sometimes result in secondary neurological involvement. The two patients described elsewhere who have MYO5A mutations and neurological complications but no immunologic defects may not have GS but instead may have Elejalde syndrome, a condition characterized by mild hypopigmentation and severe, primary neurological abnormalities.",1
12053146,"We analyzed mixed chimerism (MC) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) using a capillary electrophoresis system with four kinds of fluorescence-labeled primers for microsatellites (D3S1359, D6S89, ACTBP2, HGH). The sensitivities of all microsatellites were at least 3%. The present method is sufficiently rapid: only 3-4 h are needed to perform all the procedures. For analysis of MC in 30 patients who had undergone allogeneic SCT, heterozygosity of all microsatellites was over 88% and informativeness of ACTBP2 and HGH was over 73%. We analyzed MC using this technique to determine whether it was useful for prediction of the prognosis of 22 patients who had undergone allogeneic SCT. MC was more frequently observed in patients who were treated without total body irradiation (TBI) than in patients who were treated with TBI (p = 0.009). MC was also seen in a larger percentage of patients without acute graft-versus-host disease (p = 0.027). Six patients developed graft failure or relapse among 12 patients with MC. The graft failure or relapse was higher in patients with MC than in patients with complete chimerism (CC) (p = 0.009) especially if they were over 30 years of age (p = 0.0005). In contrast, graft failure or relapse was not higher in patients with MC compared with patients with CC under 30 years of age (p = 0.78). These results show that MC is an important predictive factor, especially in patients over 30 years of age.",1

11987242,"Chuvash polycythemia (CP) is an autosomal recessive condition that is endemic in the Russian mid-Volga River region of Chuvashia. We previously found that CP patients may have increased serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels, ruled out linkage to both the EPO and EPO receptor (EPOR) gene loci, and hypothesized that the defect may lie in the oxygen homeostasis pathway. We now report a study of five multiplex Chuvash families which confirms that CP is associated with significant elevations of serum EPO levels and rules out a location for the CP gene on chromosome 11 as had been reported by other investigators or a mutation of the HIF-1 alpha gene. Using a genome-wide screen, we localized a region on chromosome 3 with a LOD score >2. After sequencing three candidate genes, we identified a C to T transition at nucleotide 598 (an R200W mutation) in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. The VHL protein (pVHL) downregulates the alpha subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1 alpha), the main regulator of hypoxia adaptation, by targeting the protein for degradation. In the simplest scenario, disruption of pVHL function causes a failure to degrade HIF-1 alpha resulting in accumulation of HIF-1 alpha, upregulation of downstream target genes such as EPO, and the clinical manifestation of polycythemia. These findings strongly suggest that CP is a congenital disorder of oxygen homeostasis.",1

11960918,"We determined inactivation of the CDKN2A (p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF)) gene in 21 cases of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The tumours were also analysed for mutations in exons 5-8 and allelic losses in the p53 gene. In addition, we screened the CDKN2B (p15 INK4b), CDKN2C (p18 INK4c), CDK4 and p53R2 genes for mutations in the tumour tissues. Besides concomitant alterations in the CDKN2A and p53 loci in more than half of the cases, our results showed that in 18 OSCC (86%) the CDKN2A (p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) ) gene was affected through mutations, homozygous/hemizygous deletions and promoter hypermethylation. Eight out of 10 tumours with mutations or promoter hypermethylation specific to the CDKN2A/p16 INK4a gene showed loss of the wild-type allele. One tumour with a single base deletion in the N-terminus (codon 8) of the CDKN2A/p16(INK4a) gene carried a novel germ-line mutation or a rare polymorphism (Ile51Met) in exon 2 of the CDK4 gene. Promoter hypermethylation in the CDKN2A/p14 ARF gene was detected in 11 tumours. In the p53 gene 15 mutations were detected in 14 tumours. We detected an inverse relationship between CDKN2A/p16 INK4a inactivation and frequency of loss of heterozygosity at the p53 locus (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.98; Fisher exact test, P-value approximately 0.03). Screening of nine exons of the p53R2 [Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) official name RRM2B] gene resulted in identification of a novel polymorphism in the 5' untranslated region, which was detected in four cases. Our results suggest that the CDKN2A (p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) ) and p53 genes involved in the two cell cycle pathways are major and independent targets of inactivation in OSCC.",1
11916518,"Mutations of transcription factors are associated with the pathogenesis of cancer. Genomic DNA from 381 cancers and cell lines representing leukemias, lymphomas and a variety of solid tumors were examined for mutations of genes coding for the C/EBP-beta, C/EBP-alpha, PU.1, and AML1 transcription factors using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and direct DNA sequencing. Mutation of C/EBP-beta (a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, Kcl22) and C/EBP-delta (a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, Raji) were found. Interestingly, the sample with a C/EBP-beta alterations had two missense (P236L and G252A) and two silent mutations in a highly conserved region of the gene. The C/EBP-delta alteration in Raji was a missense mutation (A177G). These findings suggest that mutations of the C/EBP-beta, C/EBP-delta, PU.1, and AML1 rarely contribute to the development of hematopoietic or solid cancers.",1
11889465,"X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is an inherited condition that causes failure to develop cognitive abilities, owing to mutations in a gene on the X chromosome. The latest XLMR update lists up to 136 conditions leading to 'syndromic', or 'specific', mental retardation (MRXS) and 66 entries leading to 'nonspecific' mental retardation (MRX). For 9 of the 66 MRX entries, the causative gene has been identified. Our recent discovery of the contiguous gene deletion syndrome ATS-MR (previously known as Alport syndrome, mental retardation, midface hypoplasia, elliptocytosis, OMIM #300194), characterized by Alport syndrome (ATS) and mental retardation (MR), indicated Xq22.3 as a region containing one mental retardation gene. Comparing the extent of deletion between individuals with ATS-MR and individuals with ATS alone allowed us to define a critical region for mental retardation of approximately 380 kb, containing four genes. Here we report the identification of two point mutations, one missense and one splice-site change, in the gene FACL4 in two families with nonspecific mental retardation. Analysis of enzymatic activity in lymphoblastoid cell lines from affected individuals of both families revealed low levels compared with normal cells, indicating that both mutations are null mutations. All carrier females with either point mutations or genomic deletions in FACL4 showed a completely skewed X-inactivation, suggesting that the gene influences survival advantage. FACL4 is the first gene shown to be involved in nonspecific mental retardation and fatty-acid metabolism.",1
11874489,"There are few data on the molecular pathogenesis of cutaneous T cell lymphomas. A recent allelotyping study by our group identified frequent allelic loss on 9p, 10q, and 17p including losses on 9p21 in 16% of patients with mycosis fungoides and 46% with Sezary syndrome. The P15 and P16 genes are intricately linked on 9p21 and can be inactivated in melanoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We have therefore studied 76 patients with either mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome for abnormalities of these genes. DNA samples were analyzed for loss of heterozygosity, homozygous deletion, intragenic mutations, and promoter methylation. In addition P15 and P16 protein expression was assessed. Microsatellite analysis was informative in 73 of 76 cases: allelic loss on 9p21 was identified in 18 patients (25%), including 12 of 57 with mycosis fungoides (21%) and six of 16 with Sezary syndrome (37%). Single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of the entire coding regions of both genes did not identify any mutations, although two polymorphisms were identified including C613A, which has not previously been described. P15 and P16 gene promoter methylation was found in 45% and 29% of patients, respectively. Furthermore aberrant P15 protein expression was detected in 85% of patients analyzed with P15 gene abnormalities and abnormal P16 expression in 59% with P16 gene abnormalities. These abnormalities were not dependent on cutaneous stage of disease. This study suggests that abnormalities of the P15 and P16 genes are common in both early and advanced stages of mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome and that these genes may be inactivated by allelic loss and aberrant promoter methylation.",1
11867739,"Human chromosomes 21 and 22 (mainly the q-arms) were the first complete parts of the human genome released. Our analysis of genes, pseudogenes (Psig), and Alu repeats across these chromosomes include the following findings: The number of gene structures containing untranslated exons exceeds 25%; the terminal exon tends to be the largest among exons, whereas, the initial intron tends to be the largest among introns; single-exon gene length is approximately the mean gene exon number times the mean internal exon length; processed Psig lengths are on average approximately the same as single-exon gene length; and the G+C content and length of genes are uncorrelated. The counts and distribution of genes, Psig, and Alu sequences and G+C variation are evaluated with respect to clusters and overdispersions. Other assessments concern comparisons of intergenic lengths, properties of Psig sequences, and correlations between Alu and Psig sequences.",0

11788616,"Androgen insensitivity syndromes (AIS) result from the incapacity for T and dihydrotestosterone to virilize male embryos and is mainly attributable to molecular defects of the AR gene. In normal males, T and LH rise during the first few months of life, and this physiological surge is commonly used to evaluate the gonadotropic axis at this age. This neonatal surge has not been evaluated in detail in newborns with AIS. We sequentially measured plasma T, LH, and FSH during the first 3 months of life in 15 neonates with AIS and AR mutation. A GnRH and an human CG stimulation test were also performed. Patients were divided in 2 groups with complete (n = 10) or partial (n = 5) AIS (CAIS or PAIS), based on the clinical phenotype. In patients with PAIS, T levels were in the high-normal range at d 30 (18.4 +/- 6.9 nM) and d 60 (12.8 +/- 3.8 nM). In contrast, plasma T values were below the normal range in 9 of 10 patients with CAIS at d 30 (1 +/- 0.3 nM) and d 60 (1.4 +/- 0.7 nM, both P < 0.004 vs. PAIS). Plasma LH values were low in CAIS at d 30 (0.7 +/- 0.1U/liter) and increased normally in PAIS (8.7 +/- 2.5 U/liter, P = 0.004). We conclude that the postnatal T and LH surge occurs expectedly in neonates with PAIS but is absent in those with CAIS and that the postnatal T rise requires the receptivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis to T.",1

Cultural metaphors that define mental illness have been traced predominantly to biomedical and systems models. However, the research on factors such as progression of illness, survival rates, adherence to medical regimens, level of disability, and experience of pain in chronic and acute life-threatening illnesses suggests another metaphor. This article not only explores how a constructivist metaphor makes sense of this research, but also suggests an approach to consider in helping patients and their families deal with the difficult life circumstances that illness imposes.

11753604,"Eighty-two unselected cases of therapy-related myelodysplasia (t-MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) were investigated for internal tandem duplications of the FLT3 gene (FLT3/ITD), for internal tandem duplications of the MLL gene (MLL/ITD) and for mutations of the WT1 gene. FLT3/ITD were observed in three patients, another two patients presented MLL/ITD whereas mutations of the WT1 gene were not observed. All FLT3/ITD included the tyrosine-rich stretch between codons 589 and 599, and both MLL/ITD presented break points within Alu-repeats, as previously observed in de novo AML. The ITD were not related to any specific type of previous therapy, but three out of the five cases were observed among only six patients with overt t-AML and a normal karyotype (P = 0.0043). Interestingly, one of the patients with FLT3/ITD presented overt t-AML of subtype M1 with a normal karyotype after treatment with an alkylating agent. Complete remission was observed following treatment with daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside, but after 37 months the patient relapsed with t-AML of subtype M3 with a t(15;17) and the same FLT3/ITD was still present. Thus FLT3/ITD may in this case represent a primary event in leukemogenesis, whereas the t(15;17) may represent a secondary event most likely induced by subsequent therapy. In conclusion, FLT3/ITD and MLL/ITD are mainly observed in uncharacteristic cases of t-AML with a normal karyotype and unrelated to previous therapy for which reason they could represent sporadic cases of de novoAML.",1
11751227,"The reconstruction of genetic networks is the holy grail of functional genomics. Its core task is to identify the causal structure of a gene network, that is, to distinguish direct from indirect regulatory interactions among gene products. In other words, to reconstruct a genetic network is to identify, for each network gene, which other genes and their activity the gene influences directly. Crucial to this task are perturbations of gene activity. Genomic technology permits large-scale experiments perturbing the activity of many genes and assessing the effect of each perturbation on all other genes in a genome. However, such experiments cannot distinguish between direct and indirect effects of a genetic perturbation.",0
11745495,"We investigated whether 2 candidate tumor-suppressor genes, VHL at 3p25-26 and PPAR gamma at 3p24.2-25, are involved in GEJ adenocarcinogenesis. In 43 GEJ tumor samples from 40 patients, the entire coding sequence of the VHL gene and the 5' and part of the 3' UTR as well as exons 3 and 5 of the PPAR gamma gene were screened by PCR-SSCP analysis. LOH at 3p25-26 was analyzed with 2 polymorphic microsatellite markers and with the VHL exon 1 and intron 2 polymorphisms. The relationship between LOH and clinicopathologic parameters was assessed. Expression of VHL was investigated by immunohistochemistry with a VHL-specific antibody. PCR-SSCP analysis of VHL revealed 2 different aberrant patterns in 19 patients. Upon DNA sequencing, 1 pattern appeared to be a previously described exon 1 polymorphism. The other single aberrant pattern was an intron 2 polymorphism, not yet described. PCR-SSCP analysis of PPAR gamma showed no aberrant migration patterns. LOH analysis revealed 3p25-26 loss in 24/36 (67%) informative cases, but this was not significantly correlated with clinicopathologic parameters. By immunohistochemistry, all tumors showed expression of VHL protein. Despite the very frequent LOH of 3p in GEJ adenocarcinomas, mutations in VHL and PPAR gamma were not detected. Mutations outside the screened sequences, a gene dosage effect or involvement of another tumor-suppressor gene on 3p as the target of LOH should be considered.",1
11741835,"ICF (immunodeficiency, centromeric region instability and facial anomalies) is a recessive disease caused by mutations in the DNA methyltransferase 3B gene (DNMT3B). Patients have immunodeficiency, chromosome 1 (Chr1) and Chr16 pericentromeric anomalies in mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes, a small decrease in overall genomic 5-methylcytosine levels and much hypomethylation of Chr1 and Chr16 juxtacentromeric heterochromatin. Microarray expression analysis was done on B-cell lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from ICF patients with diverse DNMT3B mutations and on control LCLs using oligonucleotide arrays for approximately 5600 different genes, 510 of which showed a lymphoid lineage-restricted expression pattern among several different lineages tested. A set of 32 genes had consistent and significant ICF-specific changes in RNA levels. Half of these genes play a role in immune function. ICF-specific increases in immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy constant mu and delta RNA and cell surface IgM and IgD and decreases in Ig(gamma) and Ig(alpha) RNA and surface IgG and IgA indicate inhibition of the later steps of lymphocyte maturation. ICF-specific increases were seen in RNA for RGS1, a B-cell specific inhibitor of G-protein signaling implicated in negative regulation of B-cell migration, and in RNA for the pro-apoptotic protein kinase C eta gene. ICF-associated decreases were observed in RNAs encoding proteins involved in activation, migration or survival of lymphoid cells, namely, transcription factor negative regulator ID3, the enhancer-binding MEF2C, the iron regulatory transferrin receptor, integrin beta7, the stress protein heme oxygenase and the lymphocyte-specific tumor necrosis factor receptor family members 7 and 17. No differences in promoter methylation were seen between ICF and normal LCLs for three ICF upregulated genes and one downregulated gene by a quantitative methylation assay [combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA)]. Our data suggest that DNMT3B mutations in the ICF syndrome cause lymphogenesis-associated gene dysregulation by indirect effects on gene expression that interfere with normal lymphocyte signaling, maturation and migration.",1
11741194,"Autism is a syndrome characterized by deficits in language and social skills and by repetitive behaviors. We hypothesized that potential quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to component autism endophenotypes might underlie putative or significant regions of autism linkage. We performed nonparametric multipoint linkage analyses, in 152 families from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange, focusing on three traits derived from the Autism Diagnostic Interview: ""age at first word,"" ""age at first phrase,"" and a composite measure of ""repetitive and stereotyped behavior."" Families were genotyped for 335 markers, and multipoint sib pair linkage analyses were conducted. Using nonparametric multipoint linkage analysis, we found the strongest QTL evidence for age at first word on chromosome 7q (nonparametric test statistic [Z] 2.98; P=.001), and subsequent linkage analyses of additional markers and association analyses in the same region supported the initial result (Z=2.85, P=.002; chi(2)=18.84, df 8, P=.016). Moreover, the peak fine-mapping result for repetitive behavior (Z=2.48; P=.007) localized to a region overlapping this language QTL. The putative autism-susceptibility locus on chromosome 7 may be the result of separate QTLs for the language and repetitive or stereotyped behavior deficits that are associated with the disorder.",1
11734540,"Prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD), of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and of the metabolic syndrome are in Mauritius amongst the highest in the world. As T2DM and CHD are closely associated and have both a polygenic basis, we conducted a 10 cM genome scan with 403 microsatellite markers in 99 independent families of North-Eastern Indian origin including 535 individuals. Families were ascertained through a proband with CHD before 52 years of age and additional sibs with myocardial infarction (MI) or T2DM. Model-free two-point and multipoint linkage analysis were performed using the Mapmarker-Sibs (MLS) and maximum-likelihood-binomial (MLB) programs for autosomal markers and the Aspex program for chromosome X markers. In a second step, additional markers were studied to increase the genetic map density in three regions on chromosomes 3, 8 and 16 where initial indication for linkage was found. Our data show suggestive linkage with CHD on chromosome 16p13-pter with the MLS statistics at 8.69 cM (LOD = 3.06, P = 0.00017) which partially overlaps with a high pressure (HBP) peak. At the same locus, a nominal indication for linkage with T2DM was found in 35 large T2DM Pondicherian families also having Indian origin. With respect to region 8q23, we found suggestive linkage with T2DM (LOD = 2.55, P = 0.00058) as well as with HBP. On 3q27, we replicated previous indication for linkage found in Caucasians (for the metabolic syndrome and for diabetes) according to the categorized trait for CHD and MI with the MLB statistics (LOD = 2.13, P = 0.0009). The genome scan also revealed nominal evidence of linkage with CHD on 10q23 (LOD = 2.06, P = 0.00188). Interestingly, we detected in the same region overlapping linkages with three QTLs: age of onset of CHD (LOD = 2.03), HDL cholesterol (LOD = 1.48) and LDL/HDL ratio (LOD = 1.34). Ordered-subset analysis based on family body mass index ranking replicated finding on 2q37 for T2DM (at Calpain 10 locus).

11726926,"Initially identified in high-grade gliomas, mutations in the PTEN tumor-suppressor are also found in many sporadic cancers and a few related autosomal dominant hamartoma syndromes. PTEN is a 3'-specific phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) phosphatase and functions as a negative regulator of PI3K signaling. We generated a tissue-specific deletion of the mouse homolog Pten to address its role in brain function. Mice homozygous for this deletion (PtenloxP/loxP;Gfap-cre), developed seizures and ataxia by 9 wk and died by 29 wk. Histological analysis showed brain enlargement in PtenloxP/loxP;Gfap-cre mice as a consequence of primary granule-cell dysplasia in the cerebellum and dentate gyrus. Pten mutant cells showed a cell-autonomous increase in soma size and elevated phosphorylation of Akt. These data represent the first evidence for the role of Pten and Akt in cell size regulation in mammals and provide an animal model for a human phakomatosis condition, Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD).",1
11710839,"The genetic events involved in the aetiology of non-clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a proportion of clear cell RCC remain to be defined. Germline mutations of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes cause tuberous sclerosis (TSC), a multi-system hamartoma syndrome that is also associated with RCC. We assessed 17 sporadic clear cell RCCs with a previously identified VHL mutation, 15 clear-cell RCCs without an identified VHL mutation and 15 non-clear-cell RCCs for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosomes 9q34 and 16p13.3, the chromosomal locations of TSC1 and TSC2. LOH was detected in 4/9, 1/11 and 3/13 cases informative at both loci. SSCP analysis of the whole coding region of the retained allele did not reveal any cases with a detectable intragenic second somatic mutation. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis of TSC1 and TSC2 on total RNA from 8 clear-cell RCC cell lines confirmed expression of both TSC genes. These data indicate that biallelic inactivation of TSC1 or TSC2 is not frequent in sporadic RCC and suggests that the molecular mechanisms of renal carcinogenesis in TSC are likely to be distinct.",1

11702319,"Drug interactions are important causes of both unexpected toxic and therapeutic effects. Adverse reactions due to drug interaction are proportional to the number of drugs given and the duration of administration. Although drug interactions may be beneficial, they are most often recognized when they increase mortality or morbidity. The frequency of adverse drug interactions in clinical practice makes it mandatory for physicians to know the drugs and mechanisms involved.A drug may potentiate or antagonize the effects of another drug by direct chemical or physical combination, by altering gastrointestinal absorption, by influencing metabolism, transport, or renal clearance, by changing the activity of a drug at its receptor site, or by modifying the patient's response to the drug by a variety of means. This article stresses the importance of avoiding multible drug therapy. When such treatment is unavoidable, patients must be carefully observed for evidence of intensified or diminished drug effect. Only this permits the detection and prevention of untoward drug interactions.",0
11696170,"beta-Catenin has multiple functions both in intercellular adhesion and in signal transduction. As a signaling molecule, mutations in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene stabilize this protein in the cytoplasm. Subsequently, accumulated beta-catenin protein translocates to nuclei with T-cell factor-4, and upregulates transcriptional activity of the target genes involved in carcinogenesis. Mutations in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene have been detected in various carcinomas. We examined immunolocalization of beta-catenin protein and mutations in the beta-catenin and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) genes in papillary carcinoma (25 cases), follicular carcinoma (two cases), and benign thyroid tumor (29 cases). We detected no mutation in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene in both malignant and benign thyroid tumors by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. No mutations in the mutation cluster region of APC were found in any tumor samples analyzed. Immunohistochemically, beta-catenin showed membranous localization in most specimens. These results suggest that mutations of the beta-catenin and APC genes are rare and that activation of the Wnt signaling pathway may not contribute to pathogenesis in human papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas.",1
11668501,"Irradiation to the head is associated with a significantly increased incidence of meningiomas. Radiation-induced meningiomas morphologically resemble their sporadically arising counterparts; however, they frequently exhibit a more malignant phenotype. Several genes have been shown to carry mutations in meningiomas, with the NF2 gene being most frequently affected. To examine whether the NF2 gene also plays a role in the development of radiation-induced meningiomas, we compiled a series of meningiomas from 25 patients with a history of previous cranial radiation. This series was compared with 21 atypical WHO grade II meningiomas and 15 anaplastic WHO grade III meningiomas, all from patients without a history of prior irradiation. NF2 mutations occurred significantly more often in sporadic atypical and anaplastic than in radiation-induced meningiomas (p < 0.02). In addition, all meningiomas were examined for mutations in the PTEN, TP53, HRAS, KRAS and NRAS genes. Two mutations in the TP53 gene in a sporadic and a radiation-induced tumor were detected. PTEN mutations were observed in 1 anaplastic and 1 radiation-induced meningioma. No structural alterations were seen in the RAS genes. Our data suggest that, while there is a certain overlap in the mutational spectrum, NF2 mutations may not play such a prominent role in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced compared to sporadic meningiomas.",1
11625759,"The article presents the results of French archival research concerning scholarly and scientific archives. The article points out that the subject-matter is of interest to historians of science and learning as well as archivists employed in research institutions. It is stressed that the concept of ""scholarly/scientific archives"" refers to three kinds of archives: the archives of institutions responsible for research administration, of those conducting research, as well as the archives of scholars and scientists themselves. The article presents material on the archives of the Academie des Sciences as well as other research institutions, such as the Museum d'histoire naturelle, the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, the Ecole Polytechnique, the Institut Pasteur and the Observatoire astronomique. Special attention is devoted to the establishment, gathering and arrangement of the archival materials of those institutions. The next part of the article deals with the issue of the archives of Polish scholars to be found in French archival literature. It identifies the places where such materials are stored and discusses the archival materials relating to Polish researchers and scholars that are stored at the library of the Institut de France, the Bibliotheque nationale, the central library of the Museum d'histoire naturelle as well as other research institutions. The next part of the article is devoted to problems of evaluating materials created in the course of currently conducted research. It is pointed out that archival material produced by the activities of research institutions consist of (i) administrative documents and (ii) documents concerned with course of research work itself. It is stressed in the article that unpublished research materials and working materials are ducuments of a very controversial kind, and do not lend themselves easily to precise and rational criteria of assessment. The article also points out that it is difficult to work out a general framework of criteria for the assessment of scholarly and scientific documents. In conclusion, it is stressed that the work on scholarly and scientific archives that has been produced in a joint effort by French history of science and learning and by French archival science, testifies to the wealth and diversity of French research activity, both as regards the work of individual scholars and scientists, as well as French research institutions. This work serves to underlie the role and achievements of science and learning in the creation of cultural heritage.",0
11607825,"Synovial sarcomas are high grade spindle cell tumors that are divided into two major histologic subtypes, biphasic and monophasic, according to the respective presence or absence of a well-developed glandular epithelial component. They contain in essentially all cases a t(X;18) representing the fusion of SYT (at 18q11) with either SSX1 or SSX2 (both at Xp11). Neither SYT, nor the SSX proteins contain DNA-binding domains. Instead, they appear to be transcriptional regulators whose actions are mediated primarily through protein-protein interactions, with BRM in the case of SYT, and with Polycomb group repressors in the case of SSX. Ongoing work on the SYT-SSX fusion and synovial sarcoma should yield a variety of data of broader biological interest, in areas such as BRM and Polycomb group function and dysfunction, transcriptional targets of SYT-SSX proteins and their native counterparts, differential gene regulation by SYT-SSX1 and SYT-SSX2, control of glandular morphogenesis, among others.",1

11524144,"Craniopharyngioma is the most common childhood tumor and thought to arise from embryonic remnants of Rathke's pouch. The paucity of published data on the molecular basis of these tumors prompted us to examine 22 adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas looking for genetic abnormalities. Using the X-linked polymorphic androgen receptor gene as a tool for X-chromosome inactivating analysis, we found that a subset of craniopharyngiomas are monoclonal and therefore are probably due to acquired somatic genetic defects. Thus, we investigated these tumours for mutations within three candidate genes, Gsalpha, Gi2alpha and patched (PTCH). Using single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing, the presence of somatic mutations in these genes could not be demonstrated in any tumor. Our data indicate that a subset of craniopharyngiomas are monoclonal and the mutations in the PTCH, Gsalpha, and Gi2alpha contribute little if any to craniopharyngioma development.",1
11516996,"The number of mammalian calpain protease family members has grown to 14 on last count. Overactivation of calpain 1 and calpain 2 (and their small subunit) has long been tied to acute neurological disorders (e.g. stroke and traumatic brain injury) and recently to Alzheimer's disease. Loss-of-function mutations of the calpain 3 gene have now been identified as the cause of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2A. Calpain 10 was recently identified as a susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes, whereas calpain 9 appears to be a gastric cancer suppressor. This review describes our current understanding of the calpain family members and their mechanistic linkages to the aforementioned diseases as well as other emerging pathological conditions.",1

11453655,"The chicken avidin gene family comprises the avidin gene (avd) and several homologous avidin-related genes (avrs). The sequences of the avr genes are nearly identical to each other but exhibit nonrandomly distributed, frequently nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions compared to avd. In this study, we determined the genetic distances and the phylogeny of the avd and avr genes and found differences between different exons and introns. Our results suggest the involvement of biased gene conversion in the evolution of the genes. Furthermore, one of the genes was identified as a putative fusion gene. The occurrence of both gene conversion and recombination supports the models suggesting a common initiation mechanism for conversion and crossing-over. The existence of avidin-related proteins (AVRs) is currently unknown, but the putative AVRs are expected to bind biotin similarly to avidin. However, the observed sequence differences may affect the stability and glycosylation patterns of the putative AVR proteins.",1

Clinical suspicion must be high, since the presenting symptoms can be nonspecific as in this case. Early recognition and treatment are important for maximum recovery.",1
11414763,"We have performed a homozygous deletion screen on 268 candidate genes in 90 human tumor cell lines derived from multiple types of cancers. Most of the candidate genes investigated have been proposed to be involved in cellular processes that are germane to cancer progression, such as cell cycle control, genome maintenance, chromatin remodeling, cell adhesion, and apoptosis. We have detected novel homozygous deletions affecting four independent loci: Brahma-related gene (SMARCA4) on chromosome 19p in the TSU-Pr1 prostate and A427 lung carcinoma lines, Map Kinase Kinase 3 (MAP2K3) on 17q in the NCI-H774 lung tumor cell line, TMPRSS2 on 21q in the Bx PC-3 pancreatic carcinoma line, and Cadherin 6 (CDH6) on 5p in the SK-LU-1 lung carcinoma line. Subsequent analyses of the coding sequences of these four genes using cDNAs from a panel of tumor cell lines revealed multiple sequence variants. The results of this mutation study serve to demonstrate the feasibility of performing high-throughput screens of candidate genes in tumor cell lines to identify genes that may be targeted for mutation during the development of cancer.",1
11406594,"The expression of 1008 open reading frames (ORFs) from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been examined under eight different physiological conditions, using classical northern analysis. These northern data have been compared with publicly available data from a microarray analysis of the diauxic transition in S.cerevisiae. The results demonstrate the importance of comparing biologically equivalent situations and of the standardization of data normalization procedures. We have also used our northern data to identify co-regulated gene clusters and define the putative target sites of transcriptional activators responsible for their control. Clusters containing genes of known function identify target sites of known activators. In contrast, clusters comprised solely of genes of unknown function usually define novel putative target sites. Finally, we have examined possible global controls on gene expression. It was discovered that ORFs that are highly expressed following a nutritional upshift tend to employ favoured codons, whereas those overexpressed in starvation conditions do not. These results are interpreted in terms of a model in which competition between mRNA molecules for translational capacity selects for codons translated by abundant tRNAs.",1
11395396,"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is frequently associated with the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation. It creates a NPM-ALK fusion gene, fusing the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene (2p23) and the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene (5q35). Other rearrangements involving the ALK gene have recently been shown to be associated with ALCL, among which the ATIC-ALK rearrangement resulting from the inv(2)(p23q35) translocation is probably the most recurrent. The aims of the present study were to investigate the presence of NPM-ALK and ATIC-ALK fusion genes in ALCL, using a real-time 5' exonuclease-based reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This sensitive technique was also applied to investigate whether both fusion genes might be detected in Hodgkin's disease cases and in reactive lymphoid tissue. Results of the RT-PCR were compared to ALK immunostaining, cytogenetics, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results. RT-PCR detected the NPM-ALK and ATIC-ALK fusions at high levels in 8 and 3 of a total of 13 ALK-positive ALCL cases. One ALK-positive ALCL case was negative for both fusion genes analyzed but revealed a new ALK-related translocation t(2;17)(p23;q25) by cytogenetic and FISH analysis. In addition, of the eight ALK-positive ALCL cases that were strongly positive for the NPM-ALK fusion, three cases also showed the presence of the ATIC-ALK fusion, although at much lower levels. Similarly, out of the three strongly positive ATIC-ALK cases, one case was positive for the NPM-ALK fusion, at low levels. Finally, the NPM-ALK and the ATIC-ALK fusions were detected, at equally low levels, respectively in 13 and 5 ALK-negative ALCL cases, in 11 and 5 Hodgkin's disease cases and in 20 and 1 non-neoplastic lymphoid tissues. The distinction between the high- and low-level detection was confirmed by relative quantitative RT-PCR for a representative number of cases. Of interest is the fact that the high-level detection coincided with the presence of ALK gene rearrangement detected by cytogenetics and FISH and may reflect a central role of the transcript in the oncogenic mechanism of ALK-positive ALCL. Low-level detection is not supported by cytogenetics and FISH, presumably due to the presence of the transcripts in only a small minority of normal cells not detectable by these techniques. Our findings demonstrate that NPM-ALK and ATIC-ALK fusion transcripts may be detected in conditions other than ALK-positive ALCL including reactive lymphoid tissues, although at low levels, suggesting the presence of the transcripts in normal (bystander) cells. Moreover, they suggest that the ALK gene rearrangement by itself might be insufficient to induce tumor formation. They further question the validity of quantitative real-time RT-PCR for monitoring minimal residual disease in ALCL. Finally, the newly identified translocation t(2;17)(p23;q25) can be added to the list of ALK gene rearrangements occurring in ALK-positive ALCL.",1
11389277,"Participation in organized sports provides an opportunity for young people to increase their physical activity and develop physical and social skills. However, when the demands and expectations of organized sports exceed the maturation and readiness of the participant, the positive aspects of participation can be negated. The nature of parental or adult involvement can also influence the degree to which participation in organized sports is a positive experience for preadolescents.

Recommendations are offered on how pediatricians can help determine a child's readiness to participate, how risks can be minimized, and how child-oriented goals can be maximized.",0
11343317,"Kabuki makeup (Niikawa-Kuroki) syndrome (KS) is characterized by distinct facial anomalies, mental retardation, congenital heart defect (CHD), and skeletal malformations. In the present study we analyze cardiac characteristics and differences in sex prevalence of specific CHDs in our series of patients with KS and review published reports from the literature. Between January 1992 and February 2000, 60 patients (37 males and 23 females) with KS underwent phenotypic and cardiac evaluations at our hospital. CHD was diagnosed in 35 (58%) of our patients. Aortic coarctation (COA) (23%), atrial septal defect (ASD) (20%), and ventricular septal defect (VSD) (17%) were the most frequent CHDs in our series and in previous reports from the literature. Male preponderance was noted in patients with COA. In conclusion, CHD is a cardinal feature of KS. There is an overlap between cardiac malformations of KS and those of Turner syndrome. Male preponderance in patients with KS and COA supports the hypothesis that genes located on the X chromosome may be involved in determining KS in some patients. The high prevalence of CHD prompts accurate re-examination of patients evaluated by pediatric cardiologists in order to identify mild and still unrecognized cases of KS.",1

11325814,"Autosomal dominant disorders of skeletal and cranial development have been linked to fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 2 and FGFR3. Here we report two identical mutations in FGFR2 that cause craniosynostosis syndromes, Crouzon, Apert, and Pfeiffer in gastric carcinoma. A missense mutation (Ser267Pro) in exon IIIa and a splice site mutation (940-2A-->G) in exon IIIc were detected in gastric cancer patients. Interestingly, these heterozygous somatic mutations are identical to the germinal activating mutations in FGFR2 reported previously in craniosynostosis syndromes. In addition, the two novel mutations of FGFR3 in colorectal carcinomas were identified. All identified mutations occurred at highly conserved sequences, not only in the FGFR family of molecules, but also throughout evolution and clustered in the immunoglobulin-like loop-III domain, highlighting the functional importance of this domain. Our results indicate that FGFR2 and FGFR3, in addition to their potential role in skeletal dysplasias, play an important role in tumorigenesis.",1
11318605,"Children exposed to radioactive iodine after the Chernobyl reactor accident frequently developed papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC). The predominant molecular lesions in these tumors are rearrangements of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase gene. Various types of RET rearrangements have been described. More than 90% of PTC with RET rearrangement exhibit a PTC1 or PTC3 type of rearrangement with an inversion of the H4 or ELE1 gene, respectively, on chromosome 10. To obtain closer insight into the mechanisms underlying PTC3 inversions, we analyzed the genomic breakpoints of 22 reciprocal and 4 nonreciprocal ELE1 and RET rearrangements in 26 post-Chernobyl tumor samples. In contrast to previous assumptions, an accumulation of breakpoints at the two Alu elements in the ELE1 sequence was not observed. Instead, breakpoints are distributed in the affected introns of both genes without significant clustering. When compared to the corresponding wildtype sequences, the majority of breakpoints (92%) do not contain larger deletions or insertions. Most remarkably, at least one topoisomerase I site was found exactly at or in close vicinity to all breakpoints, indicating a potential role for this enzyme in the formation of DNA strand breaks and/or ELE1 and RET inversions. The presence of short regions of sequence homology (microhomologies) and short direct and inverted repeats at the majority of breakpoints furthermore indicates a nonhomologous DNA end-joining mechanism in the formation of chimeric ELE1/Ret and Ret/ELE1 genes.",1
11317356,"Mutations in PDS (SLC26A4) cause both Pendred syndrome and DFNB4, two autosomal recessive disorders that share hearing loss as a common feature. The hearing loss is associated with temporal bone abnormalities, ranging from isolated enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (dilated vestibular aqueduct, DVA) to Mondini dysplasia, a complex malformation in which the normal cochlear spiral of 2(1/2) turns is replaced by a hypoplastic coil of 1(1/2) turns. In Pendred syndrome, thyromegaly also develops, although affected persons usually remain euthyroid. We identified PDS mutations in the proband of 14 of 47 simplex families (30%) and nine of 11 multiplex families (82%) (P=0.0023). In all cases, mutations segregated with the disease state in multiplex families. Included in the 15 different PDS allele variants we found were eight novel mutations. The two most common mutations, T416P and IVS8+1G>A, were present in 22% and 30% of families, respectively. The finding of PDS mutations in five of six multiplex families with DVA (83%) and four of five multiplex families with Mondini dysplasia (80%) implies that mutations in this gene are the major genetic cause of these temporal anomalies. Comparative analysis of phenotypic and genotypic data supports the hypothesis that the type of temporal bone anomaly may depend on the specific PDS allele variant present.",1
11234377,"It is hypothesized that gene function is modulated through the action of the ion channels of the internal nuclear membrane, and that this underlies the phenomenon of dominance and some epigenetic effects. The topographic specificity essential to gene regulation by injecting portions of ions--ion fountains--is ensured by special fountain RNAs (fRNAs), which operate as double-stranded molecules, and fions, the fRNA-binding sites on the DNA. Every specific fion.fRNA complex then binds with the protein of an ion channel in the inner nuclear membrane, whereby this channel briefly opens to dispense, e.g., Ca2+, Zn2+, or K+ from the perinuclear cistern into the nucleus, as defined by the specificity of fRNA, fion, and the channel chosen by them. Fions may be situated both in introns of genes and at their flanks, even quite far from the target gene. Allelic fions, that is, fions located in homologous sites of homologous chromosomes but differing in the capacity of binding different fRNAs, will unequally influence the ionic surroundings of their structural genes. Ion channels can provide the dominant allele with an ionic atmosphere dissimilar from that of the recessive allele. Distinctions in the nature, number, and location of fions may be the main reason why the dominant and recessive alleles of a structural gene differ in activity even though their other properties are identical. Unequal changes occurring in the vicinity of the alleles may involve chromatin configuration, transcriptional activity of the gene, mRNA processing and lifespan. Isolation of structural genes in a chromosome by long intergene spacers, and large distances between chromosomes in the nucleus prevent undesirable interference of ion fountains. Fions may be key components of many enhancers and silencers. The performance of fions may be affected by pairing of homologous nucleotide sequences of chromosomes, which generates a number of epigenetic effects, such as transvection and gene position effect. Excessive approach of a structural gene to inadequate ion fountains may cause unscheduled chromatin compaction and gene suppression.",0
11232644,"The INK4a-ARF locus encodes two tumor suppressor proteins involved in cell-cycle regulation, p16INK4a and p14ARF, whose functions are inactivated in many human cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate p14ARF and p16INK4a gene inactivation and its association with some clinocopathological parameters in colon cancer. The mutational and methylation status of the p14ARF and p16INK4a genes was analyzed in 60 primary colon carcinomas and 8 colon cancer cell lines. We have identified the first two reported mutations affecting exon 1beta of p14ARF in the HCT116 cell line and in one of the primary colon carcinomas. Both mutations occur within the N-terminal region of p14ARF, documented as important for nucleolar localization and interaction with Mdm2. Tumor-specific methylation of the p14ARF and p16INK4a genes was found in 33% and 32% of primary colon carcinomas, respectively. Methylation of the p14ARF was inversely correlated with p53 overexpression (p = 0.02). p14ARF and p16INK4a gene methylation was significantly more frequent in right-sided than in left-sided tumors (p = 0.02). Methylation of the p14ARF gene occurred more frequently in well-differentiated adenocarcinomas (p = 0.005), whereas the p16INK4a gene was more often methylated in poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas (p = 0.002). The present results underline the role of p14ARF and p16INK4a gene inactivation in the development of colon carcinoma. They suggest that the methylation profile of specific genes, in particular p14ARF and p16INK4a, might be related to biologically distinct subsets of colon carcinomas and possibly to different tumorigenic pathways.",1

11214970,"As an extension of our human cDNA project for accumulating sequence information on the coding sequences of unidentified genes, we here present the entire sequences of 100 cDNA clones of unidentified genes, named KIAA1673-KIAA1772, from three sets of size-fractionated cDNA libraries derived from human adult whole brain, hippocampus, and fetal whole brain. The average sizes of the inserts and corresponding open reading frames of cDNA clones analyzed here were 4.9 kb and 2.7 kb (corresponding to 895 amino acid residues), respectively. By computer-assisted analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences, 44 predicted gene products were classified into five functional categories of proteins relating to cell signaling/communication, nucleic acid management, cell structure/motility, protein management, and metabolism. Furthermore, the expression profiles of the genes were also studied in 10 human tissues, 8 brain regions, spinal cord, fetal brain and fetal liver by reverse-transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction, the products of which were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.",1
11172591,"The DPC4 and Madr2 genes are located at 18q21, and the LOH on chromosome 18q21 has been shown to occur frequently in colorectal cancers. To investigate the role of these genes in advanced colorectal cancers, we analyzed 29 colorectal specimens for alterations in the DPC4 and Madr2 genes. Twelve (63.2%) of 19 informative primary colorectal cancers showed allelic loss of chromosome 18q21.3 marker. An alteration of the DPC4 gene sequence was identified in 6 (20.7%) of 29 colorectal carcinomas, and the distinct Madr2 gene mobility shifts were present in 3 (10.3%) cancers. Somatic mutations were identified in these tumors by sequencing analysis. DPC4 gene alterations of 4 cases were detected in Mad homology 2 domains. There was no significant correlation between the somatic alteration of Madr2 and clinicopathological findings. However, the frequency of DPC4 mutation was significantly higher in tumors associated with liver metastasis than in those without such metastasis. Our findings suggest that somatic alteration of the DPC4 gene may play a role in tumorigenesis and liver metastasis of human colorectal cancers.",1
11156965,"We have previously identified two closely related nuclear binding proteins that specifically interact with two unique functional AT-rich sequences of the 5' regulatory region of the human insulin receptor gene. Expression of these nuclear binding proteins increases during myocyte and adipocyte differentiation, and in other tissues appears to correlate with insulin receptor content. We have hypothesized, therefore, that insulin receptor expression in the insulin target tissues is regulated at least in part by these nuclear proteins. Here we show data on purification and biochemical characterization of these DNA binding proteins. Using a conventional chromatographic purification procedure combined with electrophoresis mobility shift assay and immunoblot analyses, a unique approximately 15 kDa protein, either identical to or highly related to the architectural transcription factor HMGI(Y), has now been identified, suggesting an essential role for HMGI(Y) in regulating insulin receptor gene transcription. Direct evidence of HMGI(Y) insulin receptor promoter interactions is provided by functional analysis with the CAT reporter gene and by hormone binding studies in cells expressing HMGI(Y) antisense RNA. In these experiments, antisense HMGI(Y) specifically inhibits insulin receptor promoter function and insulin receptor protein expression, indicating that HMGI(Y) is required for proper transcription of insulin receptor gene. Moreover, our data consistently support the hypothesis that a putative defect in this nuclear binding protein may cause insulin receptor dysfunction with subsequent impairment of insulin signaling and action.",1
11129334,"Reduced expression of the TSC2 tumour suppressor gene product, tuberin, has been reported in sporadic astrocytomas, suggesting that the TSC genes may play a role in formation of sporadic glial or glioneuronal tumours. We studied paired constitutional and tumour DNA samples from 100 patients with sporadic glial and glioneuronal tumours for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the TSC1 and TSC2 loci using a combination of seven previously reported and seven novel polymorphic markers. LOH was seen in 1/16 astrocytomas, 3/15 ependymomas, 5/16 gangliogliomas, 2/14 glioblastoma multiforme, 0/7 oligodendrogliomas, 0/7 tumours of mixed oligodendrocytic/astrocytic histology, 2/11 pilocytic astrocytomas and 0/1 subependymal giant cell astrocytomas informative at both loci. However, SSCP screening of all coding exons of the TSC1 or TSC2 genes in the tumours displaying LOH, and of both genes in 21 gangliogliomas, revealed no intragenic mutations. The lack of demonstrable inactivation of both alleles of either TSC gene in any of the tumours investigated suggests that they do not play a frequent role in the aetiology of sporadic glial or glioneuronal tumours.",1
11103790,"Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is characterized by multiple gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps, mucocutaneous melanin deposition, and increased risk of cancer, mainly in the gastrointestinal tract. We examined mutations of the LKB1, beta-catenin, APC, K-ras, and p53 genes in 27 gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps from 10 patients in nine PJS families. Of these hamartomatous polyps, one intestinal polyp had an adenomatous lesion, and one gastric polyp contained adenomatous and carcinomatous lesions. Germ-line mutations of the LKB1 gene were detected in six PJS families. Somatic mutations of the LKB1 gene were found in 5 polyps, whereas loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the LKB1 locus at 19p was seen in 14 other polyps. In adenomatous lesions microdissected from hamartomatous polyps, both beta-catenin mutation and 19p LOH were detected. Furthermore, a carcinomatous lesion in a gastric hamartomatous polyp was found to contain a mutation of the p53 gene and LOH at the p53 locus in addition to LOH at the LKB1 locus and a beta-catenin mutation. K-ras mutations were detected in a few polyps, whereas no APC mutation or 5q LOH was detected in hamartomatous polyps. These results suggest that gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps in PJS patients develop through inactivation of the LKB1 gene by germ-line mutation plus somatic mutation or LOH of the unaffected LKB1 allele, and that additional mutations of the beta-catenin gene and p53 gene convert hamartomatous polyps into adenomatous and carcinomatous lesions.",1
11098218,"The published structure of the gene for uteroferrin differs from that of the human and mouse tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) genes. Polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA as template and primers designed from exon 2 of the porcine uteroferrin gene amplified a product containing two previously undescribed introns. Because of these discrepancies, we cloned an EcoRI fragment from a porcine genomic BAC library containing the uteroferrin gene, and the region containing the uteroferrin gene was completely sequenced. The uteroferrin gene spanned 2.5 kb and contained five exons, which is similar to the structure previously reported for human and mouse TRAP genes but different from the published structure of the uteroferrin gene. Southern blotting of porcine genomic DNA digested with a variety of enzymes was consistent with the sequence that we obtained. The most likely explanation for the differing results is that the previously reported structure for the uteroferrin gene was the result of artifactual elimination of introns 2 and 3 by bacteria and artifactual recombination of the region upstream of the transcription start site of this gene.",0
11094761,"The major problems in constructing transgenic animals and approaches to their solution are discussed. Modern views of the structural-functional organization of the eukaryotic genome are considered. The domain hypothesis of the genome organization is analyzed in detail, as many problems associated with a low level and a lack of tissue specificity of transgene expression can be solved at the step of construction (or reconstruction of existing domains).",0
11093271,"The renal-coloboma syndrome (RCS, MIM 120330) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by PAX2 gene mutations. We screened the entire coding sequence of the PAX2 gene for mutations in nine patients with RCS. We found five heterozygous PAX2 gene mutations: a dinucleotide insertion (2G) at position 619 in one sporadic RCS case, a single nucleotide insertion (619 + G) in three unrelated cases, and a single nucleotide deletion in a familial case. In this familial case, three affected sibs showed a striking ocular phenotypic variability. Each of the sibs carried a 619insG mutation, whilst unaffected parents did not, suggesting the presence of germline mosaicism. Interestingly, the 619insG mutation has been previously reported in several patients and is also responsible for the Pax21Neu mouse mutant, an animal model of human RCS. This study confirms the critical role of the PAX2 gene in human renal and ocular development. In addition, it emphasises the high variability of ocular defects associated with PAX2 mutations ranging from subtle optic disc anomalies to microphthalmia. Finally, the presence of PAX2 germline mosaicism highlights the difficulties associated with genetic counselling for PAX2 mutations.",1

11083071,"Despite multimodal therapy, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is associated with a poor prognosis with a median survival of less than 1 year. However, a small number of patients with GBM shows survival times of several years. Although clinical features like age and performance status at diagnosis are well known prognostic parameters, molecular markers for prognosis of overall survival are still lacking. Therefore, we compared 2 age- and gender-matched groups of GBM patients with different post-operative time to tumor progression (TTP), defined as 'short-term' for TTP of less than 6 months (n = 21), and 'long-term' for TTP of more than 24 months (n = 21) for genetic alterations of the PTEN, CDKN2A and TP53 genes as well as overexpression of the EGFR, p53 and Mdm2 proteins. For the GBMs with 'short-term' TTP vs. 'long-term' TTP, the studies revealed PTEN mutations in 4/21 vs. 2/21, TP53 mutations in 5/21 vs. 8/21, homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A gene in 5/21 vs. 6/21, overexpression of EGFR in 7/20 vs. 10/20, accumulation of p53 protein in 9/20 vs. 7/20 and of Mdm2 protein in 0/20 vs. 1/20 cases studied. Taken together, our data indicate that mutations of the PTEN and TP53 tumor suppressor genes, homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A gene as well as overexpression of the EGFR, p53 and Mdm2 proteins lack prognostic significance for overall survival time in patients with GBMs.",1

11048799,"Despite recent studies, the molecular genetic events responsible for the development of uterine endometrioid carcinoma (UEC) remain incompletely characterized. Mutations in the beta-catenin (CTNNB1) gene have been recently reported in a small percentage of UECs and in the endometrioid variant of ovarian carcinoma suggesting that the Wnt signal transduction pathway is involved in the development of female genital tract tumors with endometrioid morphology. The Wnt pathway is a critical pathway in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) with mutations occurring in the beta-catenin (CTNNB1) or adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) genes in 10 to 15% and 85% of cases, respectively. Because UEC and CRC share other molecular genetic alterations and histologic features and previous studies of UEC have not reported an analysis of the APC gene, we chose to further elucidate the role of the Wnt pathway in UEC. To this end, we analyzed 32 cases of UEC for mutations of the CTNNB1 and APC genes. Mutations of CTNNB1 were present in six of 32 (18%) cases: four grade 1 carcinomas, one grade 2, and one grade 3 carcinoma. Five missense mutations were identified, three involving Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites and two adjacent to a Ser phosphorylation site. One case contained a deletion encompassing codons 34 to 37, which includes a Ser phosphorylation site. No mutations resulting in truncation of the APC protein were found. Our results support a role for the Wnt signaling pathway via mutation of CTNNB1, but not APC, in the development of a subset of UECs.",1
11038437,"We report on a Japanese family having an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease with chromosomal instability and radiosensitivity. Clinical manifestations of affected members included short stature, osteoporosis, severe dental caries, and various neurological abnormalities, such as mental retardation, depression, dysarthria, hyperreflexia, and ataxic gait. MRI demonstrated a markedly atrophic spinal cord and degeneration of the white matter. Cytogenetic examination showed spontaneous chromosome rearrangements at 14q11.2 and hypersensitivity to radiation and bleomycin. The degree of these cytogenetic abnormalities was significantly higher in the patients than in normal controls but lower than in patients with ataxia telangiectasia or Nijmegen breakage syndrome. Moreover, genetic anticipation was observed in this family: the age of disease onset became earlier, MRI abnormalities more extensive, and the chromosome hypersensitivity to radiation increased in successive generations. We speculate that a basic defect in this family is a mutation in the gene that is responsible for DNA double-strand breakage repair.",1
11029509,"Breast cancer is the second most prevalent cancer affecting Indian women. Genetic alterations of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were attributed to the development of breast carcinomas. In the present study, human breast tumor DNAs from untreated, non-familial, Indian patients were analysed for the presence of mutations in p53, fhit, p16INK4a/p19ARF and H-ras genes. Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing analysis were used to detect point mutations. Exons 5-8 of p53, exons 1-2 of p16INK4a, exon 2 of p19ARF, exons 5-9 of fhit gene and exons 1-2 of H-ras genes were amplified and analysed individually using exon-flanking primers. Only 12% of the tumors had mutation in p53, 8% had mutation in fhit gene and none of the tumors showed evidence for mutation in p16INK4a/p19ARF and H-ras genes. Tumor B18 exhibited two novel mutations in the p53 gene, ATGright curved arrow GTG (Metright curved arrow Val) at codon 237 and AATright curved arrow GAT (Asnright curved arrow Asp) at codon 263. Both of these mutations are hitherto unreported in breast carcinomas. Tumor B20 had a non-sense mutation CGAright curved arrow TGA (Argright curved arrow Stop) at codon 306 of p53 gene. In fhit gene, tumor B1 exhibited TTCTright curved arrow TACT mutation at intron 8 and tumor B15 had a silent mutation GAGright curved arrow GAA (Gluright curved arrow Glu) at codon 123. Our results indicate that, among the genes analysed, the p53 gene was more frequently mutated than fhit, p16INK4a/p19ARF and H-ras genes in Indian mammary tumors. Transcribable point mutations of fhit gene were found to be extremely uncommon in these tumors. Mutations in the above genes are mutually exclusive and are infrequent in fhit, p16INK4a/p19ARF and H-ras genes suggesting that these genes may not play a major role in Indian breast carcinomas. However, the significant frequency of mutations in the p53 gene suggest that p53 could be one of the genes involved in the genesis of sporadic breast carcinomas in Indian women.",1
11005860,"Ubiquitin is a highly conserved protein that is encoded by a multigene family. It is generally believed that this gene family is subject to concerted evolution, which homogenizes the member genes of the family. However, protein homogeneity can be attained also by strong purifying selection. We therefore studied the proportion (p(S)) of synonymous nucleotide differences between members of the ubiquitin gene family from 28 species of fungi, plants, and animals. The results have shown that p(S) is generally very high and is often close to the saturation level, although the protein sequence is virtually identical for all ubiquitins from fungi, plants, and animals. A small proportion of species showed a low level of p(S) values, but these values appeared to be caused by recent gene duplication. It was also found that the number of repeat copies of the gene family varies considerably with species, and some species harbor pseudogenes. These observations suggest that the members of this gene family evolve almost independently by silent nucleotide substitution and are subjected to birth-and-death evolution at the DNA level.",1
10994999,"Despite its clinical and histological heterogeneity, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is now a well-recognized clinicopathological entity accounting for 2% of all adult non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and about 13% of pediatric NHL. Immunophenotypically, ALCL are of T cell (predominantly) or Null cell type; by definition, cases expressing B cell antigens are officially not included in this entity. The translocation (2;5)(p23;q35) is a recurring abnormality in ALCL; 46% of the ALCL patients bear this signature translocation. This translocation creates a fusion gene composed of nucleophosmin (NPM) and a novel receptor tyrosine kinase gene, named anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). The NPM-ALK chimeric gene encodes a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that has been shown to be a potent oncogene. The exact pathogenetic mechanisms leading to lymphomagenesis remain elusive; however, the synopsis of evidence obtained to date provides an outline of likely scenarios. Several t(2;5) variants have been described; in some instances, the breakpoints have been cloned and the genes forming a new fusion gene with ALK have been identified: ATIC-ALK, TFG-ALK and TPM3-ALK. Cloning the translocation breakpoint and identifying the ALK and NPM genes provided tools for screening material from patients with ALCL using various approaches at the chromosome, DNA, RNA, or protein level: positive signals in the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the immunostaining with anti-ALK monoclonal antibodies (McAb) serve as the most convenient tests for detection of the t(2;5) NPM-ALK since the fusion gene and ALK protein expression do not occur in normal or reactive lymphoid tissue. The wide range of NPM-ALK positivity reported in different series appears to be dependent on the inclusion and selection criteria of the ALCL cases studied. Overall, however, 43% of ALCL cases were NPM-ALK+ (83% of pediatric ALCL vs 31% of adult ALCL). Occasional non-ALCL B cell lymphomas (4%) with diffuse large cell and immunoblastic histology and Hodgkin's disease cases (3%) were NPM-ALK-, but these data are questionable. The aggregate results indicate that, in contrast to primary nodal (systemic) ALCL, the t(2;5) may be present in only 10-20% of primary cutaneous ALCL and rarely, if at all, in lymphomatoid papulosis, a potential precursor lesion; however, these 10-20% positive cases were not confirmed by anti-ALK McAb immunostaining and may represent an overestimate. Positivity for NPM-ALK is associated to various degrees with the following parameters: 44% and 45% of ALCL cases with T cell and Null cell immunophenotype, respectively, are positive, whereas only 8% of cases with a B cell immunoprofile are positive; the mean age of positive patients is significantly younger than that of negative patients; positive cases carry a better overall prognosis (but not in all studies). Recently, the homogenous category of ALK lymphoma ('ALKoma') has emerged as a distinct pathological entity within the heterogenous group of ALCL. The fact that patients with ALK lymphomas experience significantly better overall survival than ALK- ALCL demonstrates further that analysis of ALK expression has important prognostic implications. The term ALK lymphoma signifies a switch in the use of the diagnostic criteria: cases are selected on the basis of a genetic abnormality (the ALK rearrangement), instead of the review of morphological or immunophenotypical features which are clearly more prone to disagreement and controversy. Since its initial description in 1985 ALCL has become one of the best characterized lymphoma entities.",1
10978620,"The adhesion molecules identified in recent years can help improve the diagnosis of the wound age, especially of injuries with a short survival time. This is also indicative of the vitality of the wounds. The material investigated in the study originated from 465 skin wounds. The samples were taken from human autopsy material, during the surgical treatment of wounds (excision) of patients and from experimental incised wounds of mice. To judge the age of skin wounds the endothelial adhesion molecules were detected in paraffin sections after autoclaving and using the ABC technique. Human skin wounds: strong positive staining was observed of ICAM-1 1.5 h at the earliest and 3.5 days at the latest, for the P-selectin 3 min at the earliest and 7 h at the latest, for the E-selectin 1 h at the earliest and 17 days at the latest and for VCAM-1 3 h at the earliest and 3.5 days at the latest after the time of injury. The L-selectin was expressed constitutively. Mice skin wounds: strong positive immunohistochemical reactions were found as a rule earlier than in human skin wounds. The detection of an increased expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and P- and E-selectins can improve the wound age assessment in injuries with short survival times.",1
10956407,"A new method for detecting circulating tumor cells that is based on magnetic-activated cell separation (MACS) and nested mutant allele-specific amplification (nested MASA) was evaluated in patients with colorectal cancer using the p53 and K-ras genes as genetic markers. By negative selection with anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody-conjugated supermagnetic microbeads, the proportion of tumor cells was enriched 9-fold. By the combination of MACS and nested MASA, 10 tumor cells in 10(7) normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells could be detected without false-positives. Using this method, we examined blood taken from the tumor drainage veins of 23 patients with colorectal cancer. Eighty-seven percent (20/23) of primary tumor tissues showed p53 and/or K-ras gene mutations. Forty-five percent (9/20) of patients with p53 and/or K-ras mutations in the primary tumor showed the same mutated genes in the blood samples. There was a significant association between the presence of p53 and K-ras gene mutation in the blood and tumor size, depth of invasion, and venous invasion. Blood gene mutation was detected in 80% (4/5) of samples from patients with synchronous liver metastases. Sixty percent (3/5) of patients with mutant genes in the blood developed asynchronous liver metastases after surgery. The overall survival of patients with p53 and/or K-ras gene mutation-positive findings in blood was significantly shorter than that of patients testing negative on Kaplan-Meier analysis. Our results suggest that the method may be useful for reliable detection of tumor cells circulating in the blood and may help to identify patients at high risk for relapse.",1
10945648,"We undertake a detailed study of the one-locus two-allele partial selfing selection model. We show that a polymorphic equilibrium can exist only in the cases of overdominance and underdominance and only for a certain range of selfing rates. Furthermore, when it exists, we show that the polymorphic equilibrium is unique. The local stability of the polymorphic equilibrium is investigated and exact analytical conditions are presented. We also carry out an analysis of local stability of the fixation states and then conclude that only overdominance can maintain polymorphism in the population. When the linear local analysis is inconclusive, a quadratic analysis is performed. For some sets of selective values, we demonstrate global convergence. Finally, we compare and discuss results under the partial selfing model and the random mating model.",0
10932186,"The autosomal recessive form of Robinow syndrome (RRS; MIM 268310) is a severe skeletal dysplasia with generalized limb bone shortening, segmental defects of the spine, brachydactyly and a dysmorphic facial appearance. We previously mapped the gene mutated in RRS to chromosome 9q22 (ref. 4), a region that overlaps the locus for autosomal dominant brachydactyly type B (refs 5,6). The recent identification of ROR2, encoding an orphan receptor tyrosine kinase, as the gene mutated in brachydactyly type B (BDB1; ref. 7) and the mesomelic dwarfing in mice homozygous for a lacZ and/or a neo insertion into Ror2 (refs 8,9) made this gene a candidate for RRS. Here we report homozygous missense mutations in both intracellular and extracellular domains of ROR2 in affected individuals from 3 unrelated consanguineous families, and a nonsense mutation that removes the tyrosine kinase domain and all subsequent 3' regions of the gene in 14 patients from 7 families from Oman. The nature of these mutations suggests that RRS is caused by loss of ROR2 activity. The identification of mutations in three distinct domains (containing Frizzled-like, kringle and tyrosine kinase motifs) indicates that these are all essential for ROR2 function.",1
10910890,"To date, all of the chromosomal deletions that cause alpha-thalassemia remove the structural alpha genes and/or their regulatory element (HS -40). A unique deletion occurs in a single family that juxtaposes a region that normally lies approximately 18-kilobase downstream of the human alpha cluster, next to a structurally normal alpha-globin gene, and silences its expression. During development, the CpG island associated with the alpha-globin promoter in the rearranged chromosome becomes densely methylated and insensitive to endonucleases, demonstrating that the normal chromatin structure around the alpha-globin gene is perturbed by this mutation and that the gene is inactivated by a negative chromosomal position effect. These findings highlight the importance of the chromosomal environment in regulating globin gene expression.",1
10905501,"Crystalline silica was recently classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). However, the direct genotoxic effect of silica in humans remains unclear. We examined the p53 and K-ras gene mutations in lung cancer in workers with silicosis (LCWS). DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues and examined by PCR-RFLP, PCR-SSCP, and DNA sequencing. The mutation frequencies of p53 gene were high, but the mutation distributions in exons and among the histological types of LCWS differed from those of common (i.e., not silicosis-related) lung cancer. Furthermore, no mutations in codon 12 of K-ras gene (predominant in common lung cancer) were found in LCWS. These findings in the mutational spectrum support a carcinogenic effect of silica dust at the DNA molecular level.",1

We first undertook a comparison of orthologous genomic loci from human and mouse, studying the extent of similarity in the number, size and sequence of exons and introns. We then developed an approach for recognizing genes within such orthologous regions by first aligning the regions using an iterative global alignment system and then identifying genes based on conservation of exonic features at aligned positions in both species. The alignment and gene recognition are performed by new programs called and, respectively. performed well at exact identification of coding exons in 117 orthologous pairs tested.",0
10894775,"Stereotyped feeding damage attributable solely to rolled-leaf hispine beetles is documented on latest Cretaceous and early Eocene ginger leaves from North Dakota and Wyoming. Hispine beetles (6000 extant species) therefore evolved at least 20 million years earlier than suggested by insect body fossils, and their specialized associations with gingers and ginger relatives are ancient and phylogenetically conservative. The latest Cretaceous presence of these relatively derived members of the hyperdiverse leaf-beetle clade (Chrysomelidae, more than 38,000 species) implies that many of the adaptive radiations that account for the present diversity of leaf beetles occurred during the Late Cretaceous, contemporaneously with the ongoing rapid evolution of their angiosperm hosts.",0
10884679,"Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers have steadily grown in popularity in the past decade in a variety of disciplines, ranging from materials science to biomedicine. This can be attributed in part to their use in applications that range from computer toners to medical diagnostics. PAMAM dendrimers are safe and nonimmunogenic, and can function as highly efficient cationic polymer vectors for delivering genetic material into cells. They have been shown to be as efficient or more efficient than either cationic liposomes or other cationic polymers (e.g. polyethylenimine, polylysine) for in vitro gene transfer. This article will focus on the application of PAMAM dendrimers as a nonviral gene delivery vector from the initial discovery of this capacity to the most recent experimental findings.",0

Information on genomic sequence can be used experimentally with high-density DNA arrays that allow complex mixtures of RNA and DNA to be interrogated in a parallel and quantitative fashion. DNA arrays can be used for many different purposes, most prominently to measure levels of gene expression (messenger RNA abundance) for tens of thousands of genes simultaneously. Measurements of gene expression and other applications of arrays embody much of what is implied by the term 'genomics'; they are broad in scope, large in scale, and take advantage of all available sequence information for experimental design and data interpretation in pursuit of biological understanding.",0

10851082,"A region on chromosome 14q32.1 is often involved in chromosomal translocations and inversions with one of the T-cell receptor loci in T-cell lymphoproliferative diseases. The breakpoints of the different rearrangements segregate into two clusters; a cluster due to inversion on the centromeric side and a cluster due to simple balanced translocations on the telomeric side. If the target gene activated by these different types of chromosomal rearrangements is the same, the gene must be localized between the two clusters of breakpoints in a region of around 160 kb. Within this breakpoint cluster region, we isolated two genes; namely, TCL1 and TML1/TCL1b genes. In the course of characterizing the TML1 gene, we further identified a third novel gene, which we named TCL6 (T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 6), from a region 7 kb upstream of the TML1 locus. The TCL6 gene expressed at least 11 isoforms through very complex alternative-splicing, including splicing with the TML1 gene. Those isoforms encode at least five open reading frames (ORFs) with no homology to known sequences. The localization of the proteins corresponding to these ORF was determined by fusing green fluorescence protein at the carboxyl terminal of each ORF. ORF141 and ORF72 were observed in the cytoplasmic region, while ORF105, ORF119, and ORF163 were predominantly localized in the nuclear region. Since the TCL6 gene was expressed in T-cell leukemia carrying a t(14;14)(q11;q32.1) chromosome translocation and was not expressed in normal T-cells (just like the TML1 and TCL1 genes), it is also a candidate gene potentially involved in leukemogenesis.

10818632,"David Haig's intragenomic conflict theory concerning the possible evolutionary origins of genomic imprinting is discussed. It is suggested that a useful way in which one might represent Haig's theory to a popular audience would be by emphasizing a gene's eye viewpoint. In doing so, an author may help to dispel common misconceptions about evolution and natural selection, misconceptions which arise in part from an overemphasis on the individual, rather than the gene, when discussing natural selection. Although it is possible to view either the gene or the individual as a unit of natural selection, our own proclivity towards overemphasizing the role of individuals in evolution is seen as a common impediment to a more complete understanding of both natural selection, as well as the philosophical implications arising from a gene's eye view of evolutionary theory.",0
10818601,"One of the most important goals in the continuous struggle against cancer is early detection of the disease by a simple method that can be used in routine laboratory practice. According to several recent reports, early detection may be achieved by monitoring alterations at several microsatellite loci containing tri- and tetranucleotide repeats. The method relies on comparison of the intensity of allele bands in cancer tissue, plasma, and lymphocytes of a patient. Microsatellite instability is typically detected by labeling the DNA with a radioactive probe or a fluorescent dye followed by electrophoresis on 20-40-cm-long denaturing polyacrylamide gels. In this study, we show that loss of heterozygosity at the ACTBP2 locus in lung cancer patients can be detected using the Elchrom electrophoresis system and just 4-cm-long precast Spreadex gels.",1
10808896,"A study carried out with first year students on a Diploma in Nursing programme at Nottingham University School of Nursing revealed that some students were struggling with basic arithmetic. A group was subsequently set up to address a range of issues relating to mathematics in nursing and nurse education. One of the areas investigated by the group was minimum entry requirement to the Diploma programme. In particular we wanted to determine the reliability of Mathematics GCSE Grade C as an indicator of arithmetic competence. Academic grades in mathematics (achieved prior to attendance at the School of Nursing) were compared with scores in an arithmetic test administered to students upon commencement on the Diploma in Nursing programme. It was found that the performance of students with Mathematics GCSE Grade C varied widely and some students could not solve basic arithmetic problems without the aid of a calculator. Schools of Nursing which adopt a policy of minimum qualifications in mathematics should not be complacent in assuming that students will be competent at arithmetic. The implementation of a programme of early assessment and tutorial support throughout the Diploma in Nursing programme is also recommended.",0
10802660,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurogenetic disease characterized by infantile hypotonia, gonadal hypoplasia, obsessive behaviour and neonatal feeding difficulties followed by hyperphagia, leading to profound obesity. PWS is due to a lack of paternal genetic information at 15q11-q13 (ref. 2). Five imprinted, paternally expressed genes map to the PWS region, MKRN3 (ref. 3), NDN (ref. 4), NDNL1 (ref. 5), SNRPN (refs 6-8 ) and IPW (ref. 9), as well as two poorly characterized framents designated PAR-1 and PAR-5 (ref. 10). Imprinting of this region involves a bipartite 'imprinting centre' (IC), which overlaps SNRPN (refs 10,11). Deletion of the SNRPN promoter/exon 1 region (the PWS IC element) appears to impair the establishment of the paternal imprint in the male germ line and leads to PWS. Here we report a PWS family in which the father is mosaic for an IC deletion on his paternal chromosome. The deletion chromosome has acquired a maternal methylation imprint in his somatic cells. We have made identical findings in chimaeric mice generated from two independent embryonic stem (ES) cell lines harbouring a similar deletion. Our studies demonstrate that the PWS IC element is not only required for the establishment of the paternal imprint, but also for its postzygotic maintenance.",1
10782927,"Desmoid tumors arise sporadically or as part of the extraintestinal manifestations of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). In FAP, two distinct clinical presentations of the desmoid phenotype are seen: 1) one or a few desmoid tumors present predominantly in the abdominal wall or the abdomen; 2) a florid proliferation of tumors early in life, mostly near the axial skeleton or extremities. These different phenotypes have been associated with different sites of germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC gene). We present a large, French-Canadian kindred with a florid desmoid tumor phenotype caused by a germline mutation at codon 2643-2644 of the APC gene. The phenotype was characterized by the early onset of multiple tumors, arising near the axial skeleton and in proximal extremities. The penetrance of desmoid tumors was near 100% in this kindred. However, the expression of the disease was variable amongst the different affected relatives. Many gene carriers had cutaneous cysts. Polyposis of the colon was rarely observed in the affected individuals and we did not document upper gastro-intestinal polyps. The mutant APC allele did not express a stable truncated protein in vivo. Molecular analysis of the proband's tumor DNA revealed a somatic inactivating mutation of the wild-type allele. Immunohistochemistry on the tumor also demonstrated elevated levels of beta-catenin. The present study demonstrates that this extreme 3' APC mutation is associated with a severely penetrant desmoid phenotype and attenuated polyposis coli. It also suggests the involvement of the beta-catenin pathway in the development of desmoid tumors in FAP. The natural history of the disease is variable between individuals, and surgical interventions have to be timed appropriately due to the frequent recurrences.",1

Pancreas transcription factor 1 is a heterooligomer of pancreas-specific (p48) and ubiquitous (p75/E2A and p64/HEB) basic helix-loop-helix proteins. We have examined the role of p48 in the phenotype of azaserine-induced rat DSL6 tumors and cancers of the human exocrine pancreas. Serially transplanted acinar DSL6 tumors express p48 whereas DSL6-derived cell lines, and the tumors induced by them, display a ductal phenotype and lack p48. In human pancreas cancer cell lines and tissues, p48 is present in acinar tumors but not in ductal tumors. Transfection of ductal pancreas cancers with p48 cDNA did not activate the expression of amylase nor a reporter gene under the control of the rat elastase promoter. In some cell lines, p48 was detected in the nucleus whereas in others it was cytoplasmic, as in one human acinar tumor. Together with prior work, our findings indicate that p48 is associated with the acinar phenotype of exocrine pancreas cancers and it is necessary, but not sufficient, for the expression of the acinar phenotype.",1
10767369,"PTEN is a newly isolated candidate tumor suppressor gene and its mutation is the most frequently found in endometrial cancer (EC), a very common female pelvic malignant disease. Mutations of the KRAS gene are also reported in this disease. Recent analysis of the PTEN protein suggested the possibility that this protein acts in the same pathway as does the RAS protein. To elucidate this possibility further, we performed a mutation analysis of these two genes in 44 endometrial cancer specimens (38 primary tumors and 6 cell lines). Altogether 23 (52%) of 44 tumors had mutations in either PTEN or KRAS, but none of them had mutations in both of these genes. These results support the idea that the protein products of these two genes act in the same growth regulatory pathway in the endometrium.",1
10766474,"The roots of German Aerospace Medicine are in Berlin. High altitude research was performed by physiologists like Nathan Zuntz and the very first Army flight surgeons, Koschel and Flemming. With the founding of the Scientific Society for Aeronautics in 1912, a medical committee was established to determine guidelines for the physical examination of flyers. In World War I aviation medicine became a military science, which came to an end with the Treaty of Versailles. In 1927, with the establishment of the first Aeromedical Institute in Hamburg, Ludolph Brauer restarted the civilian academic aeromedical research effort, which, thereafter, fell more and more under military influence. At the end of World War II, German scientists were invited to work at the USAAF Aero Medical Center (AMC) in Heidelberg (1945-47), to gather the results of German aeromedical research performed before and during the war. Some of this group of German scientists were invited to work in the USA. In Germany, on the other hand, the effect of this ""brain drain"" was a period of stagnation. In the 1950's, a new civilian institute of aviation medicine was established in Bonn. It grew to be the nucleus of the DLR Institute of Aviation Medicine in Cologne. The German Air Force Institute of Aviation Medicine was founded in Fuerstenfeldruck in 1959, and in the GDR the Institute of Aviation Medicine was established in 1961: the first East German cosmonaut S. Jaehn 1978 (Soyuz-31), was succeeded by the first West German astronaut, U. Merbold in 1983 (Spacelab).",0
10762538,"The genetics of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is complex and is thought to involve multiple genes. It is known that three regions on chromosome 11p15 (BWSCR1, BWSCR2, and BWSCR3) may play a role in the development of BWS. BWSCR2 is defined by two BWS breakpoints. Here we describe the cloning and sequence analysis of 73 kb containing BWSCR2. Within this region, we detected a novel zinc-finger gene, ZNF215. We show that two of its five alternatively spliced transcripts are disrupted by both BWSCR2 breakpoints. Parts of the 3' end of these splice forms are transcribed from the antisense strand of a second zinc-finger gene, ZNF214. We show that ZNF215 is imprinted in a tissue-specific manner.",1
10754072,"In viruses an increased coding ability is provided by overlapping genes, in which two alternative open reading frames (ORFs) may be translated to yield two distinct proteins. The identification of signature sequences in overlapping genes is a topic of particular interest, since additional out-of-frame coding regions can be nested within known genes. In this work, a novel feature peculiar to overlapping coding regions is presented. It was detected by analysis of a sample set of 21 virus genomic sequences and consisted in the repeated occurrence of a cluster of basic amino acid residues, encoded by a frame, combined to a stretch of acidic residues, encoded by the corresponding overlapping frame. A computer scan of an additional set of virus sequences demonstrated that this feature is common to several other known overlapping ORFs and led to prediction of a novel overlapping gene in hepatitis G virus (HGV). The occurrence of a bifunctional coding region in HGV was also supported by its extremely lower rate of synonymous nucleotide substitutions compared to that observed in the other gene regions of the HGV genome. Analysis of the amino acid sequence that was deduced from the putative overlapping gene revealed a high content of basic residues and the presence of a nuclear targeting signal; these characteristics suggest that a core-like protein may be expressed by this novel ORF.",0
10753186,"Somatic mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53 have been frequently detected in esophagal cancers, but their biological significance remains to be established. The tumor suppressor activity of p53 results in part from its ability to transactivate genes involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis, such as p21, bax and PIG3, and some p53 mutations may have a differential effect on the transactivation of these target genes. We developed yeast strains in which the activation by wild-type p53 of reporter plasmids containing p53 binding sites present within these target genes induces a change in the color of the colonies (red/white). Using these strains, we analyzed 56 esophageal cancers from patients residing in Normandy, France, a high incidence geographic area. Forty-seven tumors (84%), scored as mutant with the p21, bax and PIG3 reporter strains and in most of the cases (76%), the percentage of red colonies suggested that both p53 alleles were inactivated. Sequencing analysis allowed the identification of a p53 mutation in each positive sample, and the spectrum of mutations was in agreement with the etiological role of tobacco and alcohol. These results confirm the high frequency of biallelic p53 mutations in esophageal carcinoma and strongly suggest that their biological consequence is the complete alteration of the transactivation of genes involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis, which indicates that p53 alteration is a key event in esophagus carcinogenesis.",1
10735503,"We investigated three patients with cardiac angiosarcomas and two with cardiac rhabdomyosarcomas, all for mutations at exons 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the p53 gene and at exon 1 of K-ras. No point mutations were observed in the p53 gene in any of the five cases; however, at exon 1 of K-ras, three patients (60%) presented the same mutation at the first base of codon 13 (G to A transition). Interestingly, this mutation was detected in both rhabdomyosarcoma and angiosarcoma histologic sarcoma types.",1
10731138,"Collections of nonredundant, full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) clones for each of the model organisms and humans will be important resources for studies of gene structure and function.

10730700,"Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) mathematics scores of eighth graders who had received music instruction were compared according to whether the students were given private lessons. Comparisons also were made between students whose lessons were on the keyboard versus other music lessons. Analyses indicated that students who had private lessons for two or more years performed significantly better on the composite mathematics portion of the ITBS than did students who did not have private lessons. In addition, students who received lessons on the keyboard had significantly higher ITBS mathematics scores than did students whose lessons did not involve the keyboard. These results are discussed in relation to previous research on music training and mathematics achievement.",0
10720575,"By applying a novel software tool, information on 4080 UniGene clusters was retrieved from three adult human skeletal muscle cDNA libraries, which were selected for being neither normalized nor subtracted. Reconstruction of a transcriptional profile of the corresponding tissue was attempted by a computational approach, classifying each transcript according to its level of expression. About 25% of the transcripts accounted for about 80% of the detected transcriptional activity, whereas most genes showed a low level of expression. This in silico transcriptional profile was then compared with data obtained by a SAGE study. A fairly good agreement between the two methods was observed. About 400 genes, highly expressed in skeletal muscle or putatively skeletal muscle-specific, may represent the minimal set of genes needed to determine the tissue specificity. These genes could be used as a convenient reference to monitor major changes in the transcriptional profile of adult human skeletal muscle in response to different physiological or pathological conditions, thus providing a framework for designing DNA microarrays and initiating biological studies.",0
10706127,"Breast cancer heterogeneity can be related directly to its variability at the genetic level. Thus, tumor genotyping could be a valuable approach to define breast tumor subtypes. It has been shown that it is possible to delineate subgroups of breast tumors according to specific sets of DNA amplifications. The aim of the present work was to study the prognostic significance of these DNA amplifications. We studied DNA amplification at eight genes or loci (AIB1, CCND1, EMS1, ERBB2, FGFR1, MDM2, MYC, and RMC20C001) as well as p53 mutations in a series of 640 breast cancer patients who had not received presurgical therapy and analyzed the correlations with survival DNA amplification was assessed by Southern blotting and was scored positive when exceeding three to five copies. Mutations in the p53 gene were searched by four-color fluorescent single. strand conformational polymorphism, using an automated sequencer. Of the nine genetic alterations tested, four (CCND1, EMS1, FGFR1, and p53 mutations) showed a significant association with reduced disease-free (DFS) and/or overall survival (OVS) in the unselected set of patients by univariate test. Correlations for p53 were found only when selecting mutations in exons 5 or 7. Analysis of node-negative and -positive subgroups of patients showed that MDM2 amplification and p53 mutations bore prognostic significance in node-negative patients, whereas amplification of CCND1, EMS1, and FGFR1 correlated with poor outcome in node-positive patients. Multivariate analysis on an unselected set of patients retained significance for the amplification of EMS1, FGFR1, and MDM2 with DFS, of CCND1 with OVS, and of RMC20C001 with both DFS and OVS. Interestingly, stratified analysis according to nodal status confirmed results obtained in the univariate tests: significance of MDM2 amplification and p53 mutations in node-negative and that of CCND1, EMS1, and FGFR1 in node-positive patients. We also observed an association between the number of genetic alterations observed in a tumor and poor prognosis. Patients with two or more amplified loci had a worsened outcome. Strongly correlating coamplifications such as CCND1 and FGFR1, as well as ERBB2 and MYC, were associated with a significant reduction of patient survival, thus indicating cooperative effects. Our data support the idea that genetic alterations in breast cancer are not only helpful for phenotyping purposes, but can also represent powerful prognostic indicators in the clinical practice.",1
10675895,"At present, the assignment of function to novel genes uncovered by the systematic genome-sequencing programmes is a problem. Many studies anticipate that this can be achieved by analysing patterns of gene expression via the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome. Thus, functional genomics is, in part, an exercise in pattern classification. Because many genes have known functional classes, the problem of predicting their functional class is a supervised learning problem. However, most pattern classification methods that have been applied to the problem have been unsupervised clustering methods. Consequently, the best classification tools have not always been used. Furthermore, the present functional classes are suboptimal and new unsupervised clustering methods are needed to improve them. Better-structured functional classes will facilitate the prediction of biochemically testable functions.",0
10675480,"Functional defects in DNA mismatch repair genes have been shown to be associated mainly with hereditary human malignancies. We examined genomic DNA from 88 sporadic transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) of the urinary tract for mutations in hMSH6 gene by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing analysis. Mutational status of p53 gene was also studied as a potential target of genetic instability secondary to hMSH6 dysfunction. A total of 5 cases (5.7%: 5/88) displayed hMSH6 mutations all consisted of transition and located in exon 4, including three cases with missense mutation and two without change of corresponding amino acid. These three tumors with hMSH6 missense mutation had no microsatellite instability with five microsatellite markers tested. p53 gene mutations were detected in 22 cases (25.0%: 22/88). No tumors with p53 mutation had any hMSH6 missense mutations. Compared to the cases without hMSH6 alterations, the three patients with hMSH6 alterations had more frequent additional primary cancer (P<0.05). These findings provide the first in vivo evidence for the type of alterations and frequency of possible involvement of the hMSH6 mutations in sporadic type urothelial TCCs.",1

More efficient thermoelectric materials need to be identified, especially for low-temperature applications in electronics and devices. The material CsBi(4)Te(6) has been synthesized and its properties have been studied. When doped appropriately, it exhibits a high thermoelectric figure of merit below room temperature (ZT(max) approximately 0.8 at 225 kelvin).

10611687,"Arthropods, annelids and chordates all possess segments. It remains unclear, however, whether the segments of these animals evolved independently or instead were derived from a common ancestor.

This article reviews what is known about the segmentation process and considers various proposals to explain its evolution.",0
10602519,"Although most extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas (EMC) are cytogenetically characterized by the translocation t(9;22)(q22;q12), another subset has recently been identified carrying a t(9;17)(q22;q11). Whereas the t(9;22) is known to result in fusion of the CHN (TEC) gene from 9q22 with the EWS gene from 22q12, creating a chimeric EWS/CHN, the genes involved in the t(9;17) of EMC are unknown. We examined two EMC with t(9;17)(q22;q11) and found that the CHN gene was recombined with the RBP56 gene from 17q11 to generate a chimeric RBP56/CHN. RBP56 has not previously been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis but it encodes a putative RNA-binding protein similar to the EWS and FUS (TLS) proteins known to play a pathogenetic role in several sarcomas. The presence of the RBP56/CHN chimeric gene in EMC with t(9;17)(q22;q11) shows that the N-terminal parts of EWS and RBP56 have similar oncogenic potential making them pathogenetically equivalent in oncoproteins arising from fusions with certain transcription factors.",1
10602114,"Most reported microdeletions of the CREB-binding protein (CBP) gene in the Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a single cosmid probe specific to the 3' region of the gene. In order to test the hypothesis that the rate of microdeletion-positive cases would be greater if the entire gene was evaluated, we performed FISH on 66 patients with an established diagnosis of RTS, using a panel of five cosmids that span the CBP gene. Five of 66 patients had deletions by FISH (9%), consistent with those rates reported in various series that ranged between 3-25%. Among our cases, different deletions were observed; one was deleted for the 5' but not the 3' region of the CBP gene (case 055). Other deletions included a total CBP deletion extending from the 5' through the 3' region (case 017), a deletion of all but the 5' region (cases 006 and 060), and an interstitial deletion in the 3' region (case 028). Fine breakpoint mapping with additional cosmid and yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) constructs was performed on these patients. The findings of a partial 5' deletion and of interstitial deletions of the CBP gene add to the known spectrum of mutations of this gene in RTS and demonstrate the need for evaluation of the entire CBP gene region for deletions rather than only the 3' region in RTS patients. These results further suggest that the true rate of microdeletion across the CBP gene detectable by FISH has yet to be established firmly. No phenotypic differences between partial deletion, complete deletion, and nondeletion patients were observed, supporting a haploinsufficiency model for RSTS.",1

10572087,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive cancer susceptibility syndrome. The phenotype includes developmental defects, bone marrow failure, and cell cycle abnormalities. At least eight complementation groups (A-H) exist, and although three of the corresponding complementation group genes have been cloned, they lack recognizable motifs, and their functions are unknown. We have isolated a binding partner for the Fanconi anemia group C protein (FANCC) by yeast two-hybrid screening. We show that the novel gene, FAZF, encodes a 486 amino acid protein containing a conserved amino terminal BTB/POZ protein interaction domain and three C-terminal Krüppel-like zinc fingers. FAZF is homologous to the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein, which has been shown to act as a transcriptional repressor by recruitment of nuclear corepressors (N-CoR, Sin3, and HDAC1 complex). Consistent with a role in FA, BTB/POZ-containing proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis, limb morphogenesis, hematopoiesis, and proliferation. We show that FAZF is a transcriptional repressor that is able to bind to the same DNA target sequences as PLZF. Our data suggest that the FAZF/FANCC interaction maps to a region of FANCC deleted in FA patients with a severe disease phenotype. We also show that FAZF and wild-type FANCC can colocalize in nuclear foci, whereas a patient-derived mutant FANCC that is compromised for nuclear localization cannot. These results suggest that the function of FANCC may be linked to a transcriptional repression pathway involved in chromatin remodeling.",1
10568742,"With sequence analysis of the human genome well underway, there is an increasingly urgent challenge to understand the fundamental function and interplay of genes that build and maintain an organism. Several approaches will be critical for interpreting gene function, including random cDNA sequencing, expression profiling in different tissues, genetic analysis of human or model organism phenotypes, and creation of transgenic or ""knockout"" animals. Traditional gene-trapping approaches, in which genes are randomly disrupted with DNA elements inserted throughout the genome, have been used to generate large numbers of mutant organisms for genetic analysis. Recent modifications of gene-trapping methods and their increased use in mammalian systems are likely to result in a wealth of new information on gene function. Various trapping strategies allow genes to be segregated based on criteria like the specific subcellular location of an encoded protein, the tissue expression profile, or responsiveness to specific stimuli. Genome-wide gene-trapping strategies, which integrate gene discovery and expression profiling, can be applied in a massively parallel format to produce living assays for drug discovery.",0
10555134,"The etiology of the observed relationship between reading and mathematics performance was examined by analyzing data from samples of same-sex twin pairs tested in the Colorado Learning Disabilities Research Center. Bivariate phenotypic and genetic structural equation models were fitted to data from 526 twin pairs selected for reading deficits (290 identical and 236 same-sex fraternal) and 355 control pairs (220 identical and 135 same-sex fraternal). Subtests of the Peabody Individual Achievement Test (PIAT; Reading Recognition, Reading Comprehension, and Spelling) were used as measures of reading performance, and scores from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) or Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) Arithmetic subtest, the Wide Range Achievement Test Arithmetic subtest, and the PIAT Math subtest were used as indices for mathematics performance. The results of these confirmatory factor analyses indicate that genetic and environmental covariances between reading and math latent factors do not differ significantly for twin pairs in the proband and control groups. Estimates of heritability for reading performance in the proband and control samples were 0.81 and 0.69, respectively, and those for math performance were 0.88 and 0.67, respectively. Moreover, genetic influences accounted for 83% of the covariation between the reading and math factors in the proband group and for 58% of the covariation between these two latent variables in the control group; in contrast, shared environmental influences did not contribute significantly to the relationship between the reading and math latent factors nor to their independent variation.",0
10548523,"The present paper reports on the fine mapping of the ACTN2 gene and on the reconstruction of its genomic structure. By radiation hybrid mapping, the gene was located about 912 cR from the 1p-telomere. ACTN2 was placed between the marker WI-9317 (alias D1S2421) and the marker AFMA045ZC5, within the chromosomal band 1q43. The gene was detected in YAC 955 c 12. This YAC was used as template DNA for long-distance and Alu-PCR, using a set of putative exonic primers, designed on the cDNA sequence of alpha-actinin-2, in order to characterize the ACTN2 intron-exon boundaries. The entire genomic structure of the gene was reconstructed. The ACTN2 gene contained 21 exons, in a segment spanning about 40 kb of genomic DNA. Only the proximal part of the gene shows a high conservation through evolution, whereas in the remaining part a divergence from the genomic organization of C. elegans and D. melanogaster was noticed. A series of intronic primers was specifically designed and produced, to amplify all the exons of ACTN2, directly from genomic DNA. This will enable mutation screening in patients affected with hereditary diseases linked to the marker CA4F/R, a polymorphism in the last intron of the alpha-actinin-2 gene.",1
10537333,"The 9p21 gene cluster, harboring growth suppressive genes p14ARF, p15INK4b, and p16INK4a, is one of the major aberration hotspots in human cancers. It was shown that p14ARF and p16INK4a play active roles in the p53 and Rb tumor suppressive pathways, respectively, and p15INK4b is a mediator of the extracellular growth inhibition signals. To elucidate specific targets and aberrations affecting this subchromosomal region, we constructed a detailed alteration map of the 9p21 gene cluster by analyzing homozygous deletion, hypermethylation, and mutation of the p14ARF, p15INK4b, and p16INK4a genes individually in 40 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) and compared the genetic alterations with mRNA expression in 18 of these samples. We detected aberrant promoter methylation of the p16INK4a gene in 16 (40%), of p14ARF in 6 (15%), and of p15INK4b in 5 (12.5%) tumor samples. Most p16INK4a methylations were exclusive, whereas all but one of the p14ARF/p15INK4b methylations were accompanied by concomitant p16INK4a methylation. We detected homozygous deletion of p16INK4a in 7 (17.5%), of p14ARF-E1beta in 13 (33%), and of p15INK4b in 16 (40%) tumor samples. Most deletions occurred exclusively on the E1beta-p15INK4b loci. Two samples contained p14ARF deletion but with p16INK4a and p15INK4b intact. No mutation was detected in the p14ARF and p16INK4a genes. Comparative RT-PCR showed good concordance between suppressed mRNA expression and genetic alteration for p15INK4b and p16INK4a genes in the 18 frozen samples, whereas 5 of the 13 cases with suppressed p14ARF mRNA expression contained no detectable E1beta alteration but aberrations in the p16INK4a locus. Our results show that in human ESCCs, p14ARF is a primary target of homozygous deletion along with p15INK4b, whereas p16INK4a is the hotspot of hypermethylation of the 9p21 gene cluster. The frequent inactivation of the p14ARF and p16INK4a genes may be an important mechanism for the dysfunction of both the Rb and p53 growth regulation pathways during ESCC development.",1

Members of the ras gene family (Ki-ras, Ha-ras and N-ras) are structurally related and code for a protein (p21) known to play an important role in the regulation of normal signal transduction and cell growth. The frequency of ras mutations is different from one type of tumor to another, suggesting that point mutations might be carcinogen-specific.",1
10493496,"Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is characterized by defective DNA mismatch repair, which results in genetic instability of tumors; however, only a few target genes have been recognized. Our previous study detected a low frequency of APC gene mutation (21%) in colorectal tumors from HNPCC patients, in contrast to a high frequency of APC gene alteration (>70%) in non-HNPCC tumors. Because both beta-catenin and ACP gene mutations have recently been shown to activate the same signaling pathway, we analyzed beta-catenin mutation in HNPCC tumors. A notable frequency of beta-catenin gene mutation (43%, 12 of 28) was found to occur in HNPCC colorectal tumors. Beta-catenin mutations were not detected in tumors with APC mutations. All beta-catenin mutations detected in HNPCC tumors existed within the regulatory domain of beta-catenin. Immunohistochemical staining of tumors with this mutation showed accumulation of beta-catenin protein in nuclei. These and previous data from our laboratory suggest that activation of the beta-catenin-Tcf signaling pathway, through either beta-catenin or APC mutation, contributes to HNPCC colorectal carcinogenesis in approximately 65% of cases.",1
10486316,"Stickler and Marshall syndromes are dominantly inherited chondrodysplasias characterized by midfacial hypoplasia, high myopia, and sensorineural-hearing deficit. Since the characteristics of these syndromes overlap, it has been argued whether they are distinct entities or different manifestations of a single syndrome. Several mutations causing Stickler syndrome have been found in the COL2A1 gene, and one mutation causing Stickler syndrome and one causing Marshall syndrome have been detected in the COL11A1 gene. We characterize here the genomic structure of the COL11A1 gene. Screening of patients with Stickler, Stickler-like, or Marshall syndrome pointed to 23 novel mutations. Genotypic-phenotypic comparison revealed an association between the Marshall syndrome phenotype and splicing mutations of 54-bp exons in the C-terminal region of the COL11A1 gene. Null-allele mutations in the COL2A1 gene led to a typical phenotype of Stickler syndrome. Some patients, however, presented with phenotypes of both Marshall and Stickler syndromes.",1

10475130,"Several data indicate that the activation of oncogenes and growth factors as well as inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes are implicated in the development of human neoplasms, including sarcomas. In the present study we described a case of the extremely rare, but highly malignant neoplasm of the female genital tract known as sarcoma botryoides of the uterine cervix and assessed, using molecular and an immunohistochemical analysis, p53 and K-ras alterations in the tumor. A point mutation in exon 6 of the p53 tumor suppressor gene was found but no K-ras gene point mutations at codons 12, 13 and 61 were detected using molecular analysis. p53 protein was overexpressed in more than half of the neoplastic cells, however, ras p21 protein expression was not immunohistochemically detected. Our data indicate that p53, but not K-ras gene alterations may play a role in the development and progression of sarcoma botryoides of the uterine cervix.",1
10469846,"Definitive proof of function in biological systems requires genetic analysis. Only when the loss of a particular protein corresponds to the loss of a specific function can one be sure that the protein truly affects the function. Changing the pattern of gene expression through random mutagenesis or by introducing expression libraries, followed by selection of mutant or variant cells and identification of a missing or overexpressed protein, has the power to reveal or confirm the roles of specific components of signaling pathways and to provide mutant cell lines and cDNA reagents to be used in defining detailed mechanisms through structure-function analyses. These examples of forward genetics contrast with reverse genetic approaches, where the function of a known gene product is explored by knockout or replacement. Here we review a broad range of techniques that have been used to alter gene expression randomly in mammalian cells, with examples of specific discoveries that have resulted from these applications of forward genetics.",0
10463479,"ras gene mutations have been described with varying frequency in several types of human malignancies. To determine the incidence and type of ras mutations in human soft tissue tumors, we studied 45 sarcomas, including 27 malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFHs), 10 liposarcomas, 2 rhabdomyosarcomas, and 6 leiomyosarcomas. Al of the tumors were investigated by direct sequence analysis with the automated DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified ras sequences. Twenty (44%) of the sarcomas examined harbored K-ras mutations, 18 (90%) of which were MFHs. All of the K-ras mutations were G-to-A transition mutations in the second position of codon 13 (glycine --> aspartic acid). Of the samples with K-ras activation, 7 (16% of the total of 45 tumors), including 6 MFHs and 1 leiomyosarcoma, also contained H-ras mutation. All of the tumors that showed H-ras alteration had G-to-T transversion mutations in the second base of codon 12 (glycine --> valine). These data possibly implicate that ras gene activation may be a relatively uncommon event in soft tissue tumors, with the exception of MFH. It is suggested that the oncogenic process underlying the development of tumors between these groups may be different and that ras gene mutations may play a role in the etiology and/or progression of MFH. It is noteworthy that when ras gene activation occurs in sarcoma, it predominantly affects the K-ras gene, particularly codon 13. Moreover, H-ras mutations in our samples were detected only in association with tumors that also displayed K-ras-mutated genes. This study demonstrates for the first time concomitant mutations in two different members of the ras gene family in sarcoma",1
10426588,"RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in neuroendocrine cells and tumors. RET is activated by a ligand complex comprising glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and GDNF receptor-alpha (GDNFR-alpha). Activating mutations of the RET proto-oncogene were found in multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2 and in sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma of neuroendocrine origin. Mutations of the RET proto-oncogene and the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) gene were examined in human pituitary tumors. No mutations of the RET proto-oncogene including the cysteine-rich region or codon 768 and 918 in the tyrosine kinase domain were detected in 172 human pituitary adenomas either by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) or by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Further, somatic mutations of the GDNF gene in 33 human pituitary adenomas were not detected by PCR-SSCP. One polymorphism of the GDNF gene at codon 145 of TGC or TGT was observed in a prolactinoma. The RET proto-oncogene message was detected in a normal human pituitary gland or 4 of 4 human pituitary adenomas with reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and in rodent pituitary tumor cell lines with Western blotting. The expression of GDNF gene was detected in 1 of 4 human somatotroph adenomas, 1 of 2 corticotroph adenomas, and 2 of 6 rodent pituitary tumor cell lines with RT-PCR. Based on these, it is concluded that somatic mutations of the RET proto-oncogene or the GDNF gene do not appear to play a major role in the pituitary tumorigenesis in examined tumors.",1
10415480,"Genomic sequence data provide evidence for a common origin of life and for its evolution by genetic variation via mutation and recombination. This paper discusses the fundamental dialectic paradigm of evolution--stability versus variability--at the crossroads of molecular genetics, population genetics, ecology, and the emerging science of experimental evolution. Experimental evolution of molecules, viruses, and bacteria can be used not only to test some basic evolutionary hypotheses but also to create new organisms for applications in biotechnology, agriculture, and medicine.",0
10397750,"About 80% of all cases of Fanconi anemia (FA) can be accounted for by complementation groups A and C. To understand the relationship between these groups, we analyzed the expression pattern of the mouse FA group-A gene (Fanca) during embryogenesis and compared it with the known pattern of the group-C gene (Fancc). Northern analysis of RNA from mouse embryos at embryonic days 7, 11, 15, and 17 showed a predominant 4.5 kb band in all stages. By in situ hybridization, Fanca transcripts were found in the whisker follicles, teeth, brain, retina, kidney, liver, and limbs. There was also stage-specific variation in Fanca expression, particularly within the developing whiskers and the brain. Some tissues known to express Fancc (eg, gut) failed to show Fanca expression. These observations show that (1) Fanca is under both tissue- and stage-specific regulation in several tissues; (2) the expression pattern of Fanca is consistent with the phenotype of the human disease; and (3) Fanca expression is not necessarily coupled to that of Fancc. The presence of distinct tissue targets for FA genes suggests that some of the variability in the clinical phenotype can be attributed to the complementation group assignment.",1
10380936,"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was determined in 45 sporadic primary melanomas at six polymorphic microsatellite markers that flank the INK4a (p16-p14ARF) locus on chromosome 9p21. We also determined allelic loss at two markers on chromosome 9q and two markers at the Rb locus on chromosome 13. Homozygous deletion of the p16 and p14ARF genes was determined by a fluorescent-based quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction method. LOH at one or more polymorphic microsatellite markers on locus 9p21 was found in 32 of the melanomas (71%). The highest proportion of LOH was found at markers D9S736 and D9S104, which are telomeric and centromeric to the INK4 locus, respectively. Five melanomas showed LOH at all the analysed markers located on chromosome 9p21. LOH at markers D9S942 and D9S974, which are located close to the p16 and p14ARF genes, was found in 39% and 46% of melanomas, respectively. Analysis of the marker D9S257 on 9q22.1 showed LOH in 13 melanomas (44% of the informative cases). A subset of melanomas with LOH at the INK4 locus also carried inactivating mutations within the p16 coding sequence. Four melanomas carried homozygous deletions at the p16-p14ARF locus. Our results suggest, besides the involvement of the INK4 locus in sporadic melanomas, the possibility of the existence of additional tumour suppressor loci on chromosome 9.",1
10369916,"CD38 is a leukocyte activation antigen and ectoenzyme [NAD(P)+ glycohydrolase; EC 3.2.2.6] involved in numerous immune functions. The human CD38 gene is complex [eight exons, >80 kilobases (kb) long] located on Chromosome 4p15, and part of the eukaryotic NAD+ glycohydrolase/ADP-ribosyl cyclase gene family. Because of the increasing relevance of the CD38 molecule in the host immune response to infectious, tumoral, and metabolic diseases, we investigated the genetic variability and linkage of the human CD38 locus. We report that (1) the restriction endonuclease Pvu II identifies a bi-allelic polymorphism here defined as formed by the alleles CD38*A (12 kb) and CD38*B (9/2.5 kb); (2) their frequency in the healthy Italian Caucasian population is 14% and 86%, respectively; (3) the polymorphic Pvu II site is located at the 5' end of the first intron of the CD38 gene; (4) in conjunction with the polymorphic site, we identified a 900 base pair CpG island associated with the CD38 gene, with two potential Sp1 binding sites; (5) the CpG island may play a role in the regulation of CD38 expression and is hypomethylated in various cell lines; (6) by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis we show that CD38 and its paralogue, the bone-marrow stromal cell antigen BST-1 (CD157), map to the same 800 kb Avi II fragment, indicating that the two human ecto-NADase genes are closely linked.",1
10333399,"The cloning of genes involved in pathways fundamental to morphogenesis has opened the door to visualizing expression of developmental regulatory genes in many organisms. Expression data have become technical commonplace in analysis of mutants of Drosophila melanogaster and a handful of other genetic model systems. Many researchers have used probes and extended the logic from studies of D. melanogaster for comparisons of expression patterns to infer developmental bases for homologous structures among animals with diverse body plans. This research program has led to exciting but sweeping generalizations about how development evolves. Here we examine several underlying assumptions of this approach in terms of comparative and historical biology. First, we evaluate the logic that underlies the equation of gene expression similarity with homologous morphology. Second, we examine epistemological issues surrounding the descriptive visualization of gene expression patterns. We conclude by examining the role of phylogenetic coding and mapping of these patterns to examine the evolution of complex gene regulatory networks.",0
10329000,"Preaxial polydactyly is a congenital hand malformation that includes duplicated thumbs, various forms of triphalangeal thumbs, and duplications of the index finger. A locus for preaxial polydactyly has been mapped to a region of 1.9 cM on chromosome 7q36 between polymorphic markers D7S550 and D7S2423. We constructed a detailed physical map of the preaxial polydactyly candidate region. With a combination of methods we identified and positioned 11 transcripts within this map. By recombination analysis on families with preaxial polydactyly, using newly developed polymorphic markers, we were able to reduce the candidate region to approximately 450 kb. The homeobox gene HLXB9, a putative receptor C7orf2, and two transcripts of unknown function, C7orf3 and C7orf4, map in the refined candidate region and have been subjected to mutation analysis in individuals with preaxial polydactyly.",1

10208170,"The preliminary results of an international collaborative study examining premature menopause in fragile X carriers are presented. A total of 760 women from fragile X families was surveyed about their fragile X carrier status and their menstrual and reproductive histories. Among the subjects, 395 carried a premutation, 128 carried a full mutation, and 237 were noncarriers. Sixty-three (16%) of the premutation carriers had experienced menopause prior to the age of 40 compared with none of the full mutation carriers and one (0.4%) of the controls. Based on these preliminary data, there is a significant association between fragile X premutation carrier status and premature menopause.",1
10207632,"Lung cancer incidence is increasing in women with little or no tobacco exposure, and the cause of this trend is not known. One possibility is increased sensitivity to environmental tobacco smoke in women nonsmokers diagnosed with lung cancer. To determine whether mutations associated with tobacco exposure are found in the lung tumors of women who are lifetime nonsmokers or occasional smokers, we compared the p53 and K-ras mutational spectra in lung carcinomas from 23 female nonsmokers, 2 female occasional smokers (< 10 pack-years), and 30 female long-term smokers (20-100 pack-years). We also looked for p53 and K-ras mutations in three carcinoid lung tumors, two from female nonsmokers and one from a female occasional smoker. For the p53 gene, exons 4-8 were examined for mutations; for the K-ras gene, exon 1 was examined. No mutations were found in the carcinoid tumors. In lung carcinomas, p53 mutations were identified in six (26.1%) of the cases from lifetime nonsmokers and consisted of five transitions (including three C to T, one G to A, and one T to C) and one T to A transversion. In comparison, p53 mutations were identified in 10 (31.3%) of the 32 lung carcinomas from short-term and long-term smokers and consisted of six transversions (four G to T, one A to T, and one G to C), one A to G transition, one C to T transition, and two deletions of one to four bp. Mutations in the p53 gene found in nonsmokers also occurred in either different codons or different positions within a codon compared with those seen in long-term smokers. K-ras mutations in codon 12 were identified in two lung carcinomas (8.7%) from lifetime nonsmokers. The K-ras mutations found were a G to T transversion and a G to A transition. Eight (25%) of the 32 lung carcinomas from smokers contained K-ras mutations in codons 12 and 13 (four G to T transversions and four G to A transitions). In addition, six silent mutations that are most likely polymorphisms were found in both smokers and nonsmokers. These results confirm that K-ras mutations are more frequent in smokers than in nonsmokers, but that the same type of mutation in the K-ras gene is found in both groups. In contrast, although the frequency of mutation in the p53 gene was similar in lifetime nonsmokers compared with long-term smokers, the types and spectra of mutation are significantly different. Two of the C to T transitions found in nonsmokers, but none of those found in smokers, occur at the C of a CpG site. These results suggest the mutagen(s) and/or mechanisms of p53 mutations in women nonsmokers are different from those responsible for p53 mutations in women smokers, which are probably largely induced by tobacco mutagens.",1
10192423,"Relapse is a major cause of treatment failure in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and is usually accompanied by resistance to chemotherapy. To study whether relapse is accompanied by genetic alterations, we compared N-ras, p53 and FLT3 gene mutations in paired samples obtained at initial diagnosis and first relapse. 28 patients with relapsed AML were studied, and their duration of complete remission ranged from 133 to 989 d (mean 318 d). Karyotype changes were observed at relapse in 11 patients. Point mutations of the N-ras gene were positive at both stages (+/+) in three patients, positive at initial diagnosis and negative at relapse (+/-) in three patients, and negative at initial diagnosis and positive at relapse (-/+) in two patients. Internal tandem duplications of the FLT3 gene (FLT3/ITD) were +/+ in five patients, +/- in one patient, and -/+ in six patients. The p53 gene mutations were +/+ in two patients, +/- in one patient, and -/- in 25 patients. FLT3/ITD and mutant p53 at relapse were associated with short survival after relapse. These results indicate that relapse is frequently accompanied by molecular alterations that include the loss and/or acquisition of mutations. Thus relapse can be understood as clonal shift or collateral succession rather than clonal progression.",1
10190329,"Recent characterization of the molecular genetic basis of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer provides an important opportunity for identification of individuals and their families with germline mutations in mismatch repair genes. Cancer family history criteria that accurately define hereditary colorectal cancer are necessary for cost-effective testing for germline mutations in mismatch repair genes. The present report describes the results of analysis of 33 colorectal cancer cases/families that satisfy our modified family history criteria (Mount Sinai criteria) for colorectal cancer. Fourteen of these families met the more stringent Amsterdam criteria. Germline MSH2 and MLH1 mutations were identified by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and the protein truncation test, and confirmed by sequencing. Microsatellite instability analysis was performed on available tumors from affected patients. MSH2 or MLH1 mutations were detected in 8 of 14 Amsterdam criteria families and in 5 of the remaining 19 cases/families that only satisfied the Mount Sinai criteria. Three of the latter families had features of the Muir-Torre syndrome. A high level of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) was detected in almost all (16/18) colorectal cancers from individuals with MSH2 and MLH1 mutations, and infrequently (1/21) in colorectal cancer specimens from cases without detectable mutations. Families with germline MSH2 and MLH1 mutations tended to have individuals affected at younger ages and with multiple tumors. The Amsterdam criteria are useful, but not sufficient, for detecting hereditary colorectal cancer families with germline MSH2 and MLH1 mutations, since a proportion of cases and families with mutations in mismatch repair genes will be missed. Further development of cancer family history criteria are needed, using unbiased prospectively collected cases, to define more accurately those who will benefit from MSH2 and MLH1 mutation analysis.",1

10072084,"In a number of programs for gene structure prediction in higher eukaryotic genomic sequences, exon prediction is decoupled from gene assembly: a large pool of candidate exons is predicted and scored from features located in the query DNA sequence, and candidate genes are assembled from such a pool as sequences of nonoverlapping frame-compatible exons. Genes are scored as a function of the scores of the assembled exons, and the highest scoring candidate gene is assumed to be the most likely gene encoded by the query DNA sequence. Considering additive gene scoring functions, currently available algorithms to determine such a highest scoring candidate gene run in time proportional to the square of the number of predicted exons. Here, we present an algorithm whose running time grows only linearly with the size of the set of predicted exons. Polynomial algorithms rely on the fact that, while scanning the set of predicted exons, the highest scoring gene ending in a given exon can be obtained by appending the exon to the highest scoring among the highest scoring genes ending at each compatible preceding exon. The algorithm here relies on the simple fact that such highest scoring gene can be stored and updated. This requires scanning the set of predicted exons simultaneously by increasing acceptor and donor position. On the other hand, the algorithm described here does not assume an underlying gene structure model. Indeed, the definition of valid gene structures is externally defined in the so-called Gene Model. The Gene Model specifies simply which gene features are allowed immediately upstream which other gene features in valid gene structures. This allows for great flexibility in formulating the gene identification problem. In particular it allows for multiple-gene two-strand predictions and for considering gene features other than coding exons (such as promoter elements) in valid gene structures.",0
10028284,"The cytoplasmic actin genes BmA3 and BmA4 of Bombyx mori were found clustered in a single genomic clone in the same orientation. As a similar clustering of the two cytoplasmic actin genes Ha3a and Ha3b also occurs in another lepidopteran, Helicoverpa armigera, we analyzed the sequence of the pair of genes from each species. Due to the high conservation of cytoplasmic actins, the coding sequence of the four genes was easily aligned, allowing the detection of similarities in noncoding exon and intron sequences as well as in flanking sequences. All four genes exhibited a conserved intron inserted in codon 117, an original position not encountered in other species. It can thus be postulated that all of these genes derived from a common ancestral gene carrying this intron after a single event of insertion. The comparison of the four genes revealed that the genes of B. mori and H. armigera are related in two different ways: the coding sequence and the intron that interrupts it are more similar between paralogous genes within each species than between orthologous genes of the two species. In contrast, the other (noncoding) regions exhibited the greatest similarity between a gene of one species and a gene of the other species, defining two pairs of orthologous genes, BmA3 and HaA3a on one hand and BmA4 and HaA3b on the other. However, in each species, the very high similarities of the coding sequence and of the single intron that interrupts it strongly suggest that gene conversion events have homogenized this part of the sequence. As the divergence of the B. mori genes was higher than that of the H. armigera genes, we postulated that the gene conversion occurred earlier in the B. mori lineage. This leads us to hypothesize that gene conversion could also be responsible for the original transfer of the common intron to the second gene copy before the divergence of the B. mori and H. armigera lineages.",1
10024875,"Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a genetic disorder characterized by defective lysosome-related organelles. Here, we report the identification of two HPS patients with mutations in the beta 3A subunit of the heterotetrameric AP-3 complex. The patients' fibroblasts exhibit drastically reduced levels of AP-3 due to enhanced degradation of mutant beta 3A. The AP-3 deficiency results in increased surface expression of the lysosomal membrane proteins CD63, lamp-1, and lamp-2, but not of nonlysosomal proteins. These differential effects are consistent with the preferential interaction of the AP-3 mu 3A subunit with tyrosine-based signals involved in lysosomal targeting. Our results suggest that AP-3 functions in protein sorting to lysosomes and provide an example of a human disease in which altered trafficking of integral membrane proteins is due to mutations in a component of the sorting machinery.",1

9918135,"Human hepatic N-acetyltransferase (NAT2) is subject to a genetic polymorphism. Because NAT2 is an important enzyme for the detoxification and/or bioactivation of several carcinogenic arylamines, it has been postulated that the polymorphism of NAT2 gene is associated with the occurrence of colorectal and bladder carcinomas. Several mutations have been described in the human NAT2 gene that have been associated with reduced NAT2 activity. However, the majority are single base substitutions at positions 481 (NAT2*5A), 590 (NAT2*6A) and 857 (NAT2*7A) of the NAT2 gene. This study was performed to evaluate the relative distribution of NAT2 alleles and genotypes in 216 colorectal carcinoma patients and 187 normal individuals. The frequencies of NAT2 alleles and genotypes in the sampled Chinese population were characterized by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. No differences were observed in the distribution of the genotypes coding rapid acetylation (homozygous wild-type and heterozygous wild-type with any of the mutations) when comparing colorectal carcinoma patients with control individuals (P > 0.05). However, the rapid acetylation genotype was associated with cancer occurring on the right site of the colon. The frequencies of the NAT2*4, NAT2*5A, NAT2*6A and NAT2*7A alleles of the NAT2 gene (0.51, 0.07, 0.32 and 0.10, respectively) in control individuals were significantly different from those in patients (0.49, 0.06, 0.26 and 0.19, respectively, P < 0.01). There was a significant increase in the frequency of patients who were compound heterozygotes of NAT2*7A and a variant non-NAT2*7A allele. The NAT2*7A allele was also seen more frequently in distal cancer.",1
9892110,"SMAD4 (DPC4) is part of the TGFB signaling pathway and is frequently inactivated in pancreatic carcinomas. TGFB signals from the membrane to the nucleus via SMAD proteins. TGFB receptor activation results in SMAD2 and SMAD3 phosphorylation, which then form heteromeric complexes with SMAD4. Inhibitory SMADs, SMAD6 and SMAD7, can prevent TGFB signaling by interacting either with the receptor or with SMAD2 and SMAD3. The encoding sequences for these proteins are organized in two gene clusters, one at 18q21 (SMAD2, SMAD4, and SMAD7) and the other at 15q21-22 (SMAD3 and SMAD6). Losses of 15q and 18q material are frequent in pancreatic carcinomas, and in order to map the extent of 15q and 18q deletions and to investigate further the involvement of SMAD4 and the possible function of SMAD2 and SMAD3 as tumor suppressor genes in pancreatic carcinoma, we performed loss of heterozygosity studies as well as mutation and expression analyses of SMAD4, SMAD2, and SMAD3 in 13 low-passage cell lines from 12 pancreatic carcinoma patients. To investigate possible amplifications of SMAD6 and SMAD7, the genomic organization and the expression levels of these genes were analyzed. One tumor with homozygous loss of SMAD4 was detected, and mutations of this gene were found in four of the 12 carcinomas; no SMAD2 or SMAD3 inactivating genomic alterations were found. In none of the cases was transcriptional silencing seen. No genomic amplifications, mutations, or increased expression of SMAD6 and SMAD7 were detected. These results suggest that functional abrogation of SMAD2 or SMAD3 and increased expression of SMAD6 or SMAD7 are infrequent in pancreatic carcinomas and further stress the particular importance of SMAD4 inactivation in pancreatic carcinogenesis.",1

By sequencing the ends of these DNA fragments and locating their genomic origin using the available genome sequence data, promoter trapping has now been shown to identify real promoters of real genes, exactly as anticipated. Developmental expression patterns have thereby been linked to gene sequence, allowing further inferences on gene function to be drawn. Some expression patterns generated by promoter trapping include subcellular details. Localization to the surface of particular cells or even particular aspects of the cell surface was found to be consistent with the genes, now associated with these patterns, encoding membrane-spanning proteins. Data on gene expression patterns are easier to generate and characterize than mutant phenotypes and may provide the best means of interpreting the large quantity of sequence data currently being generated in genome projects.",0
9849574,"To pursue the pathogenesis of endometrial carcinogenesis, we investigated microsatellite instability, mutations in the PTEN, TGF beta RII, IGFIIR, and BAX genes, and LOHs on 10q in 18 putative endometrial premalignant lesions (11 endometrial atypical hyperplasias (ATHs), 2 complex hyperplasias, and 5 simple hyperplasias) as well as 8 endometrial cancers (ECs). In the ATH cases, MSIs as well as LOHs at 10q were observed at frequencies similar to those in ECs. Mutations in PTEN, BAX, and IGFIIR were observed only in ATHs and ECs. These results suggest that (1) PTEN, BAX, and IGFIIR are already mutated in ATHs, and (2) ATH is one of the precursor lesions which could lead to EC.",1
9831550,"In situ measurements of the chemical composition of individual aerosol particles at altitudes between 5 and 19 kilometers reveal that upper tropospheric aerosols often contained more organic material than sulfate. Although stratospheric aerosols primarily consisted of sulfuric acid and water, many also contained meteoritic material. Just above the tropopause, small amounts of mercury were found in over half of the aerosol particles that were analyzed. Overall, there was tremendous variety in aerosol composition. One measure of this diversity is that at least 45 elements were detected in aerosol particles. These results have wide implications for the complexity of aerosol sources and chemistry. They also offer possibilities for understanding the transport of atmospheric aerosols.",0
9823725,"In this study, we examined the rheological properties of elastomeric impression materials, both before and during setting, to assess the clinical significance of certain key characteristics such as viscosity, pseudoplasticity, and the rate of development of elasticity. The hypothesis to be tested was that monitoring the change in tan delta is the most appropriate means of monitoring the setting characteristics of elastomers. The loss tangent (tan delta) and the dynamic viscosity (eta') for five impression materials (both unmixed pastes and mixed/setting materials) were measured by means of a controlled-stress rheometer in a cone/plate configuration. For unmixed pastes, tests were performed at various frequencies (0.1 to 10 Hz) and torques (from 1 to 50 x 10(-4) Nm), while testing on setting materials was performed at constant frequency (1 Hz) and torque (3 x 10(-3) Nm). Most base and catalyst pastes were pseudoplastic before being mixed. Immediately after being mixed, the polyether (tan delta = 9.85) and polysulfide (tan delta = 9.54) elastomers showed tan delta markedly higher than those of other mixed materials (tan delta = 4.96 to 3.01). The polyvinylsiloxane elastomers showed lower initial tan delta, which rapidly reduced even further with time. This suggests that these materials should be used as soon as possible after being mixed. The polyether elastomer had a comparatively long induction period during which the tan delta remained at a high value. These characteristics are thought to be key factors in controlling clinical efficacy and therefore support the hypothesis that monitoring tan delta is an appropriate method for evaluating the setting characteristics of elastomers. One limitation was that the controlled-stress rheometer was unable to monitor rheological properties through to completion of setting.",0
9816078,"We analyzed allelic loss at the p53 gene (17p13) and at chromosome region 9p21 in 35 primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at p53 and 9p21 was found in 50 and 75% of informative cases, respectively. LOH at the p53 gene did not increase significantly with tumor stage, but was more frequent in moderately and poorly differentiated tumors than in well-differentiated tumors. LOH plus mutation or homozygous deletion of p53 was limited to advanced stage and poorly differentiated tumors. Allelic loss at 9p21 is frequent in early stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and is not significantly associated with LOH at p53. The second exon of the p16/MTS1/CDKN2 gene was found to be homozygously deleted in 1 of 19 cases showing LOH at 9p21, but direct sequencing did not show mutations in the remaining 18 cases. This suggests that p16 plays a limited role in the development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.",1

9792821,"The expression of ras mRNA levels in 27 human sporadic breast cancer specimens was examined, and compared to the corresponding adjacent normal tissue using the RT-PCR technique. Eighteen out of the 27 specimens (67%) exhibited two- to four-fold increased expression of ras mRNA levels, compared to corresponding normal tissue. The rates of augmented mRNA expression were similar among the three ras genes. A statistically significant correlation of overexpression of ras genes in specimens classified as Stage I disease was observed, compared to tumors in a more advanced stage (II or III). The incidence of codon 12 point mutations of the K-ras gene in fresh tissue samples was also assessed in 61 human sporadic breast cancer cases. Point mutations were detected in four (6.5%) out of the 61 cases examined; no correlation was found with any clinicopathological parameter. This is the first report to our knowledge of the differential expression of the ras family genes in breast carcinoma. Our findings indicate that the aberrant expression of ras genes may be an initial event in breast cancer oncogenesis and that K-ras point mutations are rarely involved in the development of mammary neoplasias.",1

9777952,"Gastric carcinomas with DNA replication errors (RER phenotype) display a particular clinicopathologic profile and carry a putative favorable prognosis. The RER phenotype has been identified as microsatellite instability in noncoding regions, as well as in repeat sequences within exons of several ""target genes"": TGFbeta RII, IGFII R, and BAX. In an attempt to find out whether the RER status is a significant prognostic factor in gastric carcinoma in a multivariate analysis and whether the clinicopathological features of the RER+ tumors are associated with mutations in the ""target genes,"" we evaluated a series of 152 cases of sporadic gastric carcinoma. Five or six microsatellite loci and/or BAT 26, a poly(A) tract, were analyzed in each case using polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis. Thirty-five cases (23.0%) were RER+. The RER phenotype was closely associated with a low pTNM stage and carried a significantly better prognosis. The repeat sequences of the target genes were screened for mutations in 28 RER+ and 13 RER-tumors. Mutations in TGFbeta RII occurred in 67.9% of the RER+ tumors and were significantly associated with the glandular histotype. IGFII R and BAX mutations occurred, respectively, in 25.0% and 32.1% of the cases; there was a trend toward an association between mutations in these genes and decreased nodal metastization and wall invasiveness, respectively. We conclude that the RER status is a significant prognostic indicator in gastric carcinoma and that such prognostic influence may be mediated by mutations in TGFbeta RII, IGFII R, and BAX genes.",1
9769386,"The activation of ras genes has been established as one of the steps in the process of colon tumorigenesis. These genes are converted into active oncogenes by point mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61, although a more complex way has also been shown, through alteration of gene expression. In order to investigate the spectrum of ras gene mutations, we examined 78 colorectal polypoid adenomas and 76 primary colorectal adenocarcinomas for codon 12 point mutations in K-, H- and N-ras, using a PCR-RFLP assay. K-ras mutations were found in 42.3% (33/78) of adenomas and in 36.8% (28/76) of carcinomas. Statistically significant association (p=0.043) was found between the frequency of K-ras mutations in mixed adenomas larger than 2 cm, compared to smaller mixed adenomas. On the other hand, adenocarcinomas harbored more frequently mutations, when indicating development from adenoma (p=0.016), in higher grade of differentiation (p=0.001) and in females with tumor located proximal to the rectosigmoid (p=0.013). No mutations were found in H-ras. The incidence of N-ras mutations was 1.3% in adenomas and adenocarcinomas (1/78 and 1/76 respectively). Based on our results, we propose the possibility that K-ras-dependent tumor development results in the formation of less aggressive neoplasms, than the process of K-ras-independent carcinogenesis. Our findings and other previous reports indicate that K-ras mutations might be a secondary stress-effect from extrinsic or intrinsic stimulatory factors and that these mutations are not necessarily involved in the malignant transformation of the cell.",1
9737771,"Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) is an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue and is characterized by multiple congenital contractures, arachnodactyly, and external ear malformations. Recent investigations indicate that mutations in the fibrillin-2 gene (FBN2) cause CCA. Here, we report a G-->C transversion at nucleotide 3340 (G3340C) of FBN2 in a family with phenotypic characteristics of CCA. The G3340C mutation predicts the substitution of histidine for aspartic acid at amino acid residue 1114 (Asp1114His) and also alters the 5' donor splice site consensus sequence of exon 25. Reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequence analyses demonstrate that this missense mutation also causes low level in-frame mis-splicing of exon 25 (del exon 25). Consequently, this single point mutation produces a heterogeneous population of mutant fibrillin-2 molecules in a single individual. Despite the complex manifestation of the mutation, it is associated with a relatively mild phenotype. Analysis of FBN2 allele expression in cultured dermal fibroblasts derived from the proband has shown that the mutant allele is preferentially expressed, contributing about 84% of the total transcript. This indicates that an overabundance of mutant transcript does not necessarily correlate with a more severe CCA phenotype.",1
9723908,"Shigella flexneri is the causative agent of bacillary dysentery and is a facultative intracellular pathogen. Its virulence regulon is subject to tight control by several mechanisms involving the products of over 20 genes and an array of environmental signals. The reguIon is carried on a plasmid that is prone to instability and to integration into the chromosome, with associated silencing of the virulence genes. Closely related regulons are found in other species of Shigella and in enteroinvasive Escherichia coli. A wealth of detailed information is now available on the Shigella virulence gene control circuits, and it is becoming clear that these share many features with regulatory systems found in other bacterial pathogens. All of this makes the S. flexneri virulence gene control system a very attractive topic for those interested in the nature of gene regulatory networks in bacteria.",0
9697882,"Mantle cell lymphomas (MCL) are morphologically and immunophenotypically distinctive lymphoid neoplasms characterised by overexpression of cyclin D1. Recent studies have suggested that co-operating aberrations of cell cycle associated genes may provide a growth advantage to a tumour. To address this issue further, we investigated five typical and three aggressive (blastoid) MCL for alterations in the cell cycle regulating genes p15, p16, CDK4, Rb and p53. In 3/3 aggressive cases with cyclin D1 overexpression we found aberration of at least one additional gene. One case showed diminished expression of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb); one case harboured deletion of both p15 and p16; and one case exhibited both deletion of p16 and point mutation of p53. However, we also identified two typical cases which in addition to cyclin D1 overexpression exhibited diminished pRb expression and p15 and p16 hypermethylation, respectively. Our findings confirm and extend other recent investigations and indicate that co-operating genetic alterations of cell cycle-associated genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of MCL.",1
9673367,"Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor genes have recently been proposed as new tumor suppressor genes. To define the possible participation of CDK inhibitor genes in lung carcinogenesis, we investigated the alterations of p15INK4B, p16INK4A, p21Waf1, and p27Kip1 genes in 34 human lung cancer cell lines using the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), direct sequencing, and southern dot blot methods. Among the four CDK inhibitor genes, alterations of only the p16INK4A gene were found in 8 out of 34 (24%) cell lines, and all eight cell lines having a p16INK4A gene alteration had an alteration of either the K-ras of p53 gene. Conversely, p16INK4A gene alterations were found in none of the 3 cell lines having Rb gene alterations and none of the 3 cell lines having amplification of the N-myc gene. Polymorphism was found in both p21Waf1 and p27Kip1 genes, but no association was found between the polymorphism and alterations of other genes. These results suggest that p16INK4A gene alterations may play a certain role for lung carcinogenesis in co-operation with either K-ras or p53 gene alterations.",1
9659980,"Risch and Zhang recently proposed to use extreme discordant sib pairs for mapping quantitative trait loci. Here, it is shown that the set of genetically possible distributions of the number of marker alleles in such sib-pairs is described by two inequalities. Thus, a likelihood ratio test analogous to Holmans's possible triangle test for affected sib pairs can be defined. The performance of this test is compared to the mean test considered by Risch and Zhang. For most of the genetic models considered, the mean test is slightly more powerful than the restricted likelihood ratio test. However, for models with a rare recessive gene (or equivalently a common dominant gene), the restricted likelihood ratio test is much more powerful.",0

9639521,"Mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system lead to an instability of simple repetitive DNA sequences involved in several cancer types. This instability is reflected in a high mutation rate of microsatellites, and recent studies in colon cancer indicate that defects in MMR result in frequent frameshift mutations in mononucleotide repeats located in the coding regions of BAX and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor genes. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the MMR defect may be involved in some lymphoid malignancies, although several allelotype analyses have concluded on the low level of microsatellite instability in acute lymphoblastic leukemias. To further evaluate the implication of MMR defects in leukemogenesis, we have studied a series of 98 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 14 leukemic cell lines using several indicators of MMR defects. Microsatellite markers were compared between blast and normal DNA from the same patients and mutations were sought in mononucleotide repeat sequences of BAX and TGF-beta receptor II (TGF-beta RII). The absence of microsatellite instability (MI) and the absence of mutations in the genes examined from patient's leukemic cells contrasted with the observation that half of the cell lines displayed a high degree of MI and that three of seven of these mutator cell lines harbored mutations in BAX and/or TGF-beta RII. From these results we conclude that MMR defects are very uncommon in freshly isolated blasts but are likely to be selected for during the establishment of cell lines.",1
9632163,"The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL) is an X-linked multisystem disorder with major abnormalities of eyes, nervous system, and kidneys. Clinical manifestations include congenital cataract, mental retardation, and renal tubular dysfunction. A gene (OCRL1) responsible for OCRL was identified by positional cloning and its product OCRL-1 protein was shown to be a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] 5-phosphatase localized to the Golgi apparatus. We describe three mutations in OCRL1, one in a patient with severe phenotype and two in patients with moderate phenotype (degree of mental retardation and musculoskeletal abnormalities). The patient with severe phenotype had a G-to-A transition at nucleotide (nt) 1,739, causing an Arg-to-Gln substitution at amino acid 577, and one patient with moderate phenotype had a C-to-G transversion at nt 1,812, leading to a His-to-Gln substitution at amino acid 601. Both Arg-577 and His-601 are encoded by exon 15 and are probably important for proper function of this protein, since these are conserved in various enzymes catalyzing dephosphorylation of inositol compounds. In the other patient with the moderate phenotype, there was a G-to-A transition at nt 2,797 located at the 3'-end of exon 22. This substitution led to a skip of the same exon as well as conversion of codon-930 from GCT (Ala) to ACT (Thr) in the normal-size transcript. When we measured the enzyme activity in skin fibroblasts from the three patients, the activity was less than 10%, compared to findings in normal controls. Western blot analysis showed absence or severe decrease in OCRL-1 protein in cell lysates derived from these patients.",1
9630632,"We have cloned and characterized the ACO2 gene on human chromosome 22q13, which encodes the essential iron-dependent metabolic enzyme mitochondrial aconitase. We determined that the ACO2 gene comprises 18 translated exons distributed over approximately 35 kilobasepairs (kbp) of DNA. We have shown that the ACO2 mRNA is 2.7kb in length and is expressed ubiquitously, and we can detect multiple isoforms of the ACO2 protein. As others had reported the existence of biochemically active electrophoretic variants of mitochondrial aconitase, we wished to find common ACO2 gene allozymes, functional polymorphisms that might be associated with susceptibility to human genetic diseases. We looked for ACO2 allozymes by DNA sequencing and genotyping in a population of 217 subjects, many of which had idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). We studied patients with IPD because this movement disorder is thought to arise from defects in neuronal iron and energy metabolism, two properties with which aconitase is involved. Furthermore, reports of associations between alleles of the CYP2D6 locus (nearby on 22q13) and IPD, although inconsistent, indicated that an IPD susceptibility locus might be in strong linkage disequilibrium with CYP2D6. We found three functionally silent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present in transcribed sequences that exist in similar frequencies in IPD patients and healthy controls. These ACO2 SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium with each other, providing evidence for distinct ACO2 haplotypes. We have, as yet, not detected polymorphisms that would lead to ACO2 allozymes, nor have we observed differences in ACO2 isoform prevalence or distribution in our population of IPD patients and controls. We conclude it is unlikely that polymorphism in the ACO2 gene or post-translational modification of the enzyme predispose to IPD.",1
9615731,"The p53 and PAX3 genes were examined by PCR, SSCP and DNA sequencing methods in 50 and 58 paraffinembedded medullablastoma tissues, respectively. Four novel mutations were identified among these samples in exon 5 of the p53 gene. Two tumours showed a G to A transition. One heterozygous mutation was located on codon 158 which changed the encoded amino acid from Arg (CGC) to His (CAC). Another was located on codon 174 and replaced AGG (Arg) with AAG (Lys). There was a single base deletion of guanine located on codon 160 in another two samples, causing a frameshift. This is the first study of mutation status of PAX gene in medulloblastoma wherein only one polymorphism was identified in the gene. The polymorphism changed codon 43 from GGC to GGT but both encoded glycine.",1
9614561,"We have performed a pilot study of MDR-1 gene transfer in patients receiving CD34-selected peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant for lymphoma. To ensure minimum engraftment thresholds and facilitate CD34 purification, mobilisation of > 2 x 10(6) CD34 cells/kg was a condition for recruitment. Of 11 patients counselled for study entry, only five achieved this target in a single apheresis. In three consenting patients, purified CD34 cells were exposed to A12M1 MDR-1 retroviral supernatant for 6 h, cryopreserved then thawed and readministered following ablative chemotherapy. No delay in engraftment was observed, although one patient received additional back-up cells. Gene transfer was demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for vector-derived MDR-1 cDNA sequence in all cases. Analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells after transplant has, however, shown no evidence of in vivo gene transfer with a follow-up of 12, 15 and 18 months. The effect of MDR-1 substrate drugs has not yet been tested as all patients remain in clinical and radiological remission of their lymphoma. These results confirm the difficulty of achieving in vivo gene transfer in human haemopoietic cells and indicate major logistical constraints in PBSC mobilisation in patients with relapsed and resistant disease in whom initial studies are appropriate.",1
9600949,"Analyses of complete genomes indicate that a massive prokaryotic gene transfer (or transfers) preceded the formation of the eukaryotic cell. In comparisons of the entire set of Methanococcus jannaschii genes with their orthologs from Escherichia coli, Synechocystis 6803, and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it is shown that prokaryotic genomes consist of two different groups of genes. The deeper, diverging informational lineage codes for genes which function in translation, transcription, and replication, and also includes GTPases, vacuolar ATPase homologs, and most tRNA synthetases. The more recently diverging operational lineage codes for amino acid synthesis, the biosynthesis of cofactors, the cell envelope, energy metabolism, intermediary metabolism, fatty acid and phospholipid biosynthesis, nucleotide biosynthesis, and regulatory functions. In eukaryotes, the informational genes are most closely related to those of Methanococcus, whereas the majority of operational genes are most closely related to those of Escherichia, but some are closest to Methanococcus or to Synechocystis.",0
9590181,"Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by increased cancer incidence, cell cycle checkpoint defects, and ionizing radiation sensitivity. We have isolated the gene encoding p95, a member of the hMre11/hRad50 double-strand break repair complex. The p95 gene mapped to 8q21.3, the region that contains the NBS locus, and p95 was absent from NBS cells established from NBS patients. p95 deficiency in these cells completely abrogates the formation of hMre11/hRad50 ionizing radiation-induced foci. Comparison of the p95 cDNA to the NBS1 cDNA indicated that the p95 gene and NBS1 are identical. The implication of hMre11/hRad50/p95 protein complex in NBS reveals a direct molecular link between DSB repair and cell cycle checkpoint functions.",1
9589695,"This report represents the first study in the literature linking development of severe gynecomastia, in a 17 1/2-yr-old boy, to high levels of aromatase expression in a large fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, which gave rise to extremely elevated serum levels of estrone (1200 pg/mL) and estradiol-17 beta (312 pg/mL) that suppressed FSH and LH (1.3 and 2.8 IU/L, respectively), and consequently testosterone (1.53 ng/mL). After removal of a 1.5-kg hepatocellular carcinoma, gynecomastia partially regressed, and essentially, normal hormone levels were restored (estradiol-17 beta, < 50 pg/mL; estrone, 74 pg/mL; testosterone, 6.85 ng/mL; and FSH/LH, 6.3/3.7 mIU/mL). Conversion of C19 steroids to estrogens occurs in a number of human tissues and is catalyzed by aromatase P450 (P450arom), the product of the CYP19 gene in a number of human tissues. Tissue-specific promoters are used to regulate P450arom gene transcription in adult human tissues, e.g. promoters I.4 and I.3 in adipose fibroblasts, and promoter II in the gonads. Human fetal liver uses promoter I.4 to express markedly high levels of P450arom, whereas hepatic P450arom expression normally becomes undetectable in postnatal life. Using immunohistochemistry, diffuse intracytoplasmic aromatase expression was detected in the liver cancer cells from this severely feminized boy. Northern analysis indicated the presence of P450arom transcripts in total RNA from the hepatocellular cancer but not in the adjacent liver nor in disease-free adult liver samples. Promoter use for aromatase expression was determined by a specific RT-PCR method. Promoters I.3 and II were used for P450arom gene expression in the hepatocellular cancer tissue. Because aromatase is not expressed in the disease-free adult liver, the presence of extremely high levels of aromatase expression in this fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma tissue is intriguing, particularly because there is preferential use of the proximally located P450arom promoters I.3 and II by the tumor, instead of the much more distally located fetal liver-type promoter I.4.",1

9585582,"The majority of patients with 18q- syndrome appear cytogenetically to have a terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome 18. These 18q- patients are diagnosed by use of standard cytogenetic banding techniques, which have resolution insufficient for precise genotyping. In our effort to obtain a thorough genotype, we have analyzed the DNA from 35 patients who originally were diagnosed as having de novo terminal deletions of chromosome 18. Molecular analysis was performed with polymorphic markers throughout the 18q- region. Cytogenetic FISH was performed with two human 18q telomeric probes, a chromosome 18-specific alpha-satellite probe, and whole chromosome 18-specific paint. Of 35 patients previously reported to have terminal deletions of 18q, we found that 5 (14%) have more-complex cryptic rearrangements and that 3 (9%) retain the most distal portion of 18q, consistent with an interstitial rather than a terminal deletion. These findings indicate that a standard karyotype can lead to insufficient characterization in 18q- syndrome. This has important ramifications for phenotype mapping of this syndrome, as well as for proper prognosis.",0
9573043,"Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a secreted protein that inhibits osteoclast formation. In this study the physiological role of OPG is investigated by generating OPG-deficient mice. Adolescent and adult OPG-/- mice exhibit a decrease in total bone density characterized by severe trabecular and cortical bone porosity, marked thinning of the parietal bones of the skull, and a high incidence of fractures. These findings demonstrate that OPG is a critical regulator of postnatal bone mass. Unexpectedly, OPG-deficient mice also exhibit medial calcification of the aorta and renal arteries, suggesting that regulation of OPG, its signaling pathway, or its ligand(s) may play a role in the long observed association between osteoporosis and vascular calcification.",1
9559344,"RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in neuroendocrine cells and in tumors of these cell types. RET activation may be mediated by a ligand complex comprising glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and GDNF family receptor alpha-1 (GFR alpha-1). Activating RET mutations are found in the inherited cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and in a subset of the related sporadic tumors, medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma, both being derived from neuroendocrine tissues. In one small study, mutations were identified in another tumor with neuroendocrine features, small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). To determine whether RET mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of SCLC, we examined a panel of 54 SCLC cell lines. No mutations were identified in RET exons 10, 11, and 13-16, regions previously implicated in SCLC or other neuroendocrine tumors. We further examined the expression pattern of RET and the genes encoding the components of its ligand complex GDNF and GFR alpha-1, in 21 SCLC lines by using RT-PCR. Although we found no consistent pattern of expression for these three genes, RET was expressed in 57% of SCLC lines. Thus, although RET mutations appear unlikely to be an important step in the tumorigenesis of SCLC, the frequent expression of this gene suggests that RET may have a mitogenic role in a subset of SCLC cell lines.",1

9545464,"Base composition is not uniform across the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Earlier analyses have suggested that there is variation in composition in D. melanogaster on both a large scale and a much smaller, within-gene, scale. Here we present analyses on 117 genes which have reliable intron/exon boundaries and no known alternative splicing. We detect significant heterogeneity in G+C content among intron segments from the same gene, as well as a significant positive correlation between the intron and the third codon position G+C content within genes. Both of these observations appear to be due, in part, to an overall decline in intron and third codon position G+C content along Drosophila genes with introns. However, there is also evidence of an increase in third codon position G+C content at the start of genes; this is particularly evident in genes without introns. This is consistent with selection acting against preferred codons at the start of genes.",0
9544840,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects over 40% of Down syndrome (DS) patients. The region proposed to contain the gene(s) for DS CHD has been restricted to 21q22.2-22.3, from D21S55 to MX1. The identification and functional characterization of the genes mapping to this region is a necessary step to understand the pathogenesis of CHD in DS. In an effort to contribute to the construction of a transcriptional map of the DS CHD region we have performed direct cDNA selection using a YAC contig that maps between ETS2 and D21S15 and cDNAs synthesised from fetal heart structures. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a new gene, WRB, that maps to 21q22.3 between ACTL5 and HMG 14 and appears to be widely expressed in adult and fetal tissues. The new gene encodes a basic protein of unknown function containing a tryptophan-rich carboxyl-terminal region and a potential nuclear localization signal. Immunofluorescence analysis shows a predominant localization in the cell nucleus. The understanding of the biological function of the protein product should clarify the potential role of WRB in the pathogenesis of DS CHD.",1
9541877,"In the framework of a duplication-based method for comparing gene and species trees, the concepts of ""duplication"" and ""loss"" are reformulated in set-theoretic terms. A number of related tree dissimilarity measures is suggested, and relations between them are analyzed. For any node in the species tree, the number of gene duplications for which it is a ""non-child"" loss coincides with the number of times when the node's parent is an intermediate between the mapping images of a gene node and its parent. This implies that the total number of losses is equal to the number of intermediate nodes plus the number of one-side duplications and, thus, provides an alternative proof for a conjecture made by Mirkin, Muchnik, and Smith (1995). Another formula proven involves crossings (incompatible gene-species node pairs): the number of losses equals the number of crossings plus the number of duplications.",0
9536094,"Interstitial chromosomal deletions at 22q11.2 and 7q11.23 are detected in the vast majority of patients affected by CATCH 22 syndromes and the Williams-Beuren syndrome, respectively. In a group of 15 Williams-Beuren patients, we have shown previously that a large number of 7q11.23 deletions occur in association with an interchromosomal rearrangement, indicative of an unequal crossing-over event between the two homologous chromosomes 7. In this study, we show that a similar mechanism also underlies the formation of the 22q11.2 deletions associated with CATCH 22. In eight out of 10 families with a proband affected by CATCH 22, we were able to show that a meiotic recombination had occurred at the critical deleted region based on segregation analysis of grandparental haplotypes. The incidences of crossovers observed between the closest informative markers, proximal and distal to the deletion, were compared with the expected recombination frequencies between the markers. A significant number of recombination events occur at the breakpoint of deletions in CATCH 22 patients (P = 2.99x10(-7)). The segregation analysis of haplotypes in three-generation families was also performed on an extended number of Williams-Beuren cases (22 cases in all). The statistically significant occurrence of meiotic crossovers (P = 4.45x10(-9)) further supports the previous findings. Thus, unequal meiotic crossover events appear to play a relevant role in the formation of the two interstitial deletions. The recurrence risk for healthy parents in cases where such meiotic recombinations can be demonstrated is probably negligible. Such a finding is in agreement with the predominantly sporadic occurrence of the 22q11.2 and 7q11. 23 deletions. No parent-of-origin bias was observed in the two groups of patients with regard to the origin of the deletion and to the occurrence of inter- versus intrachromosomal rearrangements.",1
9529887,"The recognition of compatible mating partners in the basidiomycete fungi requires the coordinated activities of two gene complexes defined as the mating-type genes. One complex encodes members of the homeobox family of transcription factors, which heterodimerize on mating to generate an active transcription regulator. The other complex encodes peptide pheromones and 7-transmembrane receptors that permit intercellular signalling. Remarkably, a single species may have many thousands of cross-compatible mating types because the mating-type genes are multiallelic. Different alleles of both sets of genes are necessary for mating compatibility, and they trigger the initial stages of sexual development--the formation of a specialized filamentous mycelium termed the dikaryon, in which the haploid nuclei remain closely associated in each cell but do not fuse. Three species have been taken as models to describe the molecular structure and organization of the mating-type loci and the genes sequestered within them: the pathogenic smut fungus Ustilago maydis and the mushrooms Coprinus cinereus and Schizophyllum commune. Topics addressed in this review are the roles of the mating-type gene products in regulating sexual development, the molecular basis for multiple mating types, and the molecular interactions that permit different allelic products of the mating type genes to be discriminated. Attention is drawn to the remarkable conservation in the mechanisms that regulate sexual development in basidiomycetes and unicellular ascomycete yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a theme which is developed in the general conclusion to include the filamentous ascomycetes Neurospora crassa and Podospora anserina.",0
9496908,"The human homologue of Drosophila patched (PTCH), located at chromosome 9q22.3, was recently identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene for familial and sporadic basal cell carcinomas. Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the skin display allelic loss in this chromosomal region, which, in addition to the PTCH gene, contains the DNA repair gene xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A (XPA). Patients with xeroderma pigmentosum are predisposed to non-melanoma skin tumors because of deficient excision repair of ultraviolet-induced DNA damage. Mutation analysis by single-strand conformation analysis and direct DNA sequencing of all 23 exons of the PTCH gene and all six exons of the XPA gene in 14 SCCs did not reveal structural alterations in any of these genes. Additionally, analysis of PTCH expression by in situ hybridization in SCCs revealed no evidence of upregulation of PTCH mRNA, confirming the lack of mutations in this gene. These findings suggest that another, yet to be identified gene or genes on chromosome 9q are involved in SCC tumorigenesis.",1

9432125,"The status of the CDKN2A gene family, including CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and CDKN2C, was investigated in 24 cases of neuroblastoma. These genes were selected on the basis of 1) high incidence of their inactivation in several human cancers and 2) their localization on chromosomal regions (9p and 1p) frequently rearranged in neuroblastomas. Detailed molecular analyses indicated the absence of homozygous deletions and point mutations involving these genes in all investigated tumor samples. However, when loss of heterozygostity for chromosome 9p21 (the region where CDKN2A and CDKN2B are localized) was investigated, 16% of cases showed abnormalities in an area telomeric to the CDKN2A locus. To study transcriptional silencing of the CDKN2A gene, the methylation status of exon 1 was examined. In about 35% of cases, a partial methylation was evidenced. Analysis of the CDKN2A mRNA expression, however, did not show any relationship between methylation status and gene transcription. Finally, expression of the CDKN2B gene was demonstrated in all stage IV neuroblastomas, whereas none of stage I tumors expressed this gene. This finding suggests the occurrence of a correlation between CDKN2B transcription and tumor phenotype.",1
9417891,"Betv1 homologues are a ubiquitous group of genes in flowering plants encoding a class of highly conserved defense-related proteins and containing open reading frames from 465 to 480 bp. Betv1-like genes consist of two exons interrupted by an intron of 76-359 bp, with the intron position highly conserved. The pairwise p distance ranged from 0 to 0.583 among flowering plants. Within plant families, the ranges of the p distance were 0-0.403, 0-0.253, and 0.011-0.369, for Apiaceae, Betulaceae, and Fabaceae, respectively. The most striking feature of the betv1 gene phylogeny was that the multiple sequences from each plant family formed a monophyletic group and sequences from each species were generally more similar to each other than those from other species. The almost exclusive paralogous relationships of genes from the same species suggested that the genes of the multigene family underwent strong concerted evolution. Phylogenies of Betulaceae and Fabaceae inferred from betv1 gene trees were generally congruent with those based on morphology and other molecules. Betv1 homologues constitute potential phylogenetic markers at the intrafamilial level or among closely related families in flowering plants.",1
9399594,"Down syndrome is the most common birth defect, and is caused by trisomy 21. We identified a novel gene in the so-called Down syndrome critical region by means of computer-aided exon prediction and subsequent cDNA cloning. The gene, designated as DCRA (Down syndrome Critical Region gene A), consists of eight exons of 3,252 bp in total and encodes a large open reading frame of 297 amino acid residues. The open reading frame shows significant homology to Hbeta58, a mouse gene essential for embryogenesis, PEP8, a yeast homologue of Hbeta58, and an expressed sequence tag of Arabidopsis thariana, suggesting that DCRA has some important function that has been conserved during the course of evolution. DCRA is expressed in most tissues examined, including fetal and adult brain, heart, lung, liver, and kidney. The cDNA of the DCRA mouse homologue, Dcra, was also cloned. It is 2,157 bp long and has an open reading frame of 297 amino acid residues, which shows 92% identity to human DCRA. Dcra is expressed in all the embryo and adult tissues examined.",1
9391088,"The proper development of digits, in tetrapods, requires the activity of several genes of the HoxA and HoxD homeobox gene complexes. By using a variety of loss-of-function alleles involving the five Hox genes that have been described to affect digit patterning, we report here that the group 11, 12, and 13 genes control both the size and number of murine digits in a dose-dependent fashion, rather than through a Hox code involving differential qualitative functions. A similar dose-response is observed in the morphogenesis of the penian bone, the baculum, which further suggests that digits and external genitalia share this genetic control mechanism. A progressive reduction in the dose of Hox gene products led first to ectrodactyly, then to olygodactyly and adactyly. Interestingly, this transition between the pentadactyl to the adactyl formula went through a step of polydactyly. We propose that in the distal appendage of polydactylous short-digited ancestral tetrapods, such as Acanthostega, the HoxA complex was predominantly active. Subsequent recruitment of the HoxD complex contributed to both reductions in digit number and increase in digit length. Thus, transition through a polydactylous limb before reaching and stabilizing the pentadactyl pattern may have relied, at least in part, on asynchronous and independent changes in the regulation of HoxA and HoxD gene complexes.",1
9379676,"Using the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism method and direct sequencing, 12 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and 108 fresh childhood myeloid tumor specimens, including 67 AML, 29 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and 12 juvenile chronic myelocytic leukemia (JCML) were examined for mutation in H-, K-, and N-RAS genes. The mutation was found in eight of the 120 samples (6.7%), which consisted of four cell lines (33.3%) and four fresh myeloid tumors (3.7%). The frequency of the mutation in the cell lines was apparently higher than that in fresh myeloid tumors. K-RAS gene mutations were found in two of the 67 fresh AML specimens (3%). Interestingly, these two patients had 11q23 translocations. The N-RAS gene mutation was found in one of the 29 specimens (3.4%) of MDS and in one of the 12 specimens (8.3%) of JCML. All mutations were found in codon 12, 13 or 61 of the N-RAS and K-RAS genes. Frequency of mutation of RAS genes in fresh myeloid malignancies was very low. These findings suggest that mutation of RAS genes does not play an important role in the development of childhood myeloid malignancies.",1
9375400,"In monocots, transgene expression can be stimulated by over two magnitudes by including an intron in the 5' untranslated region (UTR). The underlying mechanism is presently unknown. Inclusion of the salT intron into the 5' UTR of cat and bar genes stimulated expression of the first gene only, indicating that intron-mediated enhancement of expression (IME) is gene-dependent. Stimulation was associated with increased cat RNA levels, which did not result from a reduced cytoplasmic turnover and were not associated with increased translation. This implies that IME acts in the nucleus. Importantly, the cytoplasmic accumulation of spliced cat transcripts, even with IME, is less than that encoded by the intronless bar gene. As the cat and bar genes were flanked by identical regulatory signals, and the transcripts had a similar cytoplasmic stability it may mean that IME rescues rather than stimulates gene expression.",0
9373237,"Chromosomal translocations involving band 5q31-35 occur in several hematologic disorders. A clone with a t(5; 14)(q33; q32) translocation appeared at the relapse phase in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia who exhibited a sole chromosomal translocation, t(7; 11), at initial diagnosis. After the appearance of this clone, the leukemia progressed with marked eosinophilia, and combination chemotherapy was ineffective. Southern blot analysis showed a rearrangement of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta) gene at 5q33 which was not observed at initial diagnosis. This translocation resulted in a chimeric transcript fusing the PDGFRbeta gene on 5q33 with a novel gene, CEV14, located at 14q32. Expression of the 5' region of the PDGFRbeta cDNA, upstream of the breakpoint, was not detected. However, the 3' region of PDGFRbeta, which was transcribed as part of the CEV14-PDGFRbeta fusion gene, was detected. A partial cDNA for a novel gene, CEV14, includes a leucine zipper motif and putative thyroid hormone receptor interacting domain and is expressed in a wide range of tissues. The expression of a CEV14-PDGFRbeta fusion gene in association with aggressive leukemia progression suggests that this protein has oncogenic potential.",1
9366289,"It has been suggested that cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), including p16 and p15, are tumor suppressor genes. Alterations of CDKIs have been found in most types of cancer. However, little is known about the status of p16 and p15 genes, including methylation of the promoter region, in gastric carcinoma.",1
9330602,"APC and transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor (TGF-beta RII) gene mutations, and microsatellite instability have been found in sporadic colorectal carcinomas. To clarify further the early alterations in colorectal carcinogenesis, we investigated these genetic changes in 23 protruding- and 24 superficial-type mucosal colorectal carcinomas. TGF-beta RII gene mutations and microsatellite instability were rarely found in these lesions. Nevertheless, APC was mutated in 16 of the 47 (34.0%) mucosal colorectal carcinomas and was significantly more frequently mutated in protruding- (I) and superficial elevated-type (IIa) (14/32, 43.8%) than in other superficial-type (IIa+IIc, IIb, IIc, and IIc+IIa) (2/ 15, 13.3%) mucosal colorectal carcinomas (P < 0.04). These results indicate that the APC gene may be involved from the beginning in the tumorigenesis of many early colorectal carcinomas, particularly of the protruding and superficial elevated types. However, there might be a distinct pathway for other superficial-type colorectal carcinomas, possibly not involving APC as an initial step of tumorigenesis.",1
9326936,"Analysis of patients with inherited hypokalaemic alkalosis resulting from salt-wasting has proved fertile ground for identification of essential elements of renal salt homeostasis and blood-pressure regulation. We now demonstrate linkage of this phenotype to a segment of chromosome 1 containing the gene encoding a renal chloride channel, CLCNKB. Examination of this gene reveals loss-of-function mutations that impair renal chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. Mutations in seventeen kindreds have been identified, and they include large deletions and nonsense and missense mutations. Some of the deletions are shown to have arisen by unequal crossing over between CLCNKB and the nearby related gene, CLCNKA. Patients who harbour CLCNKB mutations are characterized by hypokalaemic alkalosis with salt-wasting, low blood pressure, normal magnesium and hyper- or normocalciuria; they define a distinct subset of patients with Bartter's syndrome in whom nephrocalcinosis is absent. These findings demonstrate the critical role of CLCNKB in renal salt reabsorption and blood-pressure homeostasis, and demonstrate the potential role of specific CLCNKB antagonists as diuretic antihypertensive agents.",1
9309118,"Recent data suggest that deletion of p16INK4 and mutation of TP53 are among the most common genetic events in the development of human cancer, since the codified proteins act as brakes of the abnormal cell cycle. As the molecular events leading to the development of pediatric bone sarcomas remain unclear, we analyzed 75 osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma samples from 43 pediatric patients to search for alterations at the TP53 or p16INK4 tumor suppressor genes. By means of PCR-DGGE (polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) we detected TP53 point mutations in 18.6% of the tumor samples, but no constitutional mutations. In the analysis of p16INK4, 7% of the samples harbored deletions of the gene but no point mutations were detected by SSCP (single strand conformation polymorphism) analysis, just the polymorphism Ala-->Thr at codon 148. These data support the hypothesis that TP53 alterations may play a role in the development of pediatric bone tumors and that the primary mechanism of inactivation of p16INK4 seems to be homozygous deletion rather than point mutation.",1
9294891,"Bacterial genes providing for single metabolic functions are found in operons, possibly because this organization allows efficient horizontal transfer among organisms. Transferred genes can confer novel metabolic phenotypes on their new hosts and allow rapid, effective exploitation of new environmental niches. Moreover, the mobility of selfish operons may facilitate bacterial speciation.",0
9291819,"An association between the presence of the activated form of Ha-ras-1 and c-myc genes and increased cellular radioresistance has been shown in several cell lines. The aim of this study was to determine whether such an association could be observed in clinical tumour biopsies. We examined 70 tumour specimens and 51 samples of peripheral blood obtained from untreated patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix mainly stage II and III. In addition to initial clinical tumour response to radiotherapy, radiosensitivity was also analysed by the subrenal capsule assay (SRCA). Mutations in exons 1 and 2 of the Ha-ras-1 gene were examined using PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing; and restriction fragment length polymorphism of the Ha-ras-1 gene was analysed using Southern hybridisation. Eight (11%) out of 70 tumours contained mutations in exons 1 and 2 of the Ha-ras-1 gene. Eleven (22%) out of the 51 tumours displayed rearrangements of the Ha-ras-1 gene (six tumours (12%) showed alterations of allele length, one amplification and four (8%) loss of one Ha-ras-1 allele). In addition, 12 (17%) out of 70 patients demonstrated the presence of rare alleles. Only one of the 70 tumours contained an amplified c-myc gene. There was no significant correlation between either rearrangements of the structure of the Ha-ras-1 and/or c-myc genes or presence of rare alleles in tumours and tumour response to radiotherapy.",1
9275651,"In order to find the significance of gene changes in the development of transitional cell carcinoma of bladder, immunohistochemical and PCR-RFLP methods were used to study the expression of P21, P185, p53 proteins and mutations in ras and p53 genes. The results showed that the P21, P185 and p53 positive rates were 59.3%, 55.3% and 29.3% respectively. Positive rates for P21 and P185 decreased with the progression of the pathological grade (P < 0.05). p53 positive rates decreased with the progression of pathological grade (P < 0.01). Positive expression of P21, P53 were significantly correlated with prognosis. Expression of more than two kinds of oncogene proteins were present in 73 cases of bladder transitional cell carcinoma. The rate of point mutation in codon 12 of Ha-ras gene of bladder transitional cell carcinoma was 32%. The p53 gene mutation rate of bladder transitional cell carcinoma was 18%, all mutations occurred at codon 248. The point mutation in codon 12 of Ha-ras gene increased with the progression of pathological grade (P < 0.05). The ras and p53 gene mutations were significantly correlated with prognosis (P < 0.05). The mortality of patients with ras and p53 gene mutation were higher than patients without mutations. 4 cases of bladder transitional cell carcinoma contained both ras and p53 gene mutations.",1
9267809,"Apoptosis, a term derived from the ancient Greek meaning a 'falling off, such as 'of leaves from a tree', is a physiologic cell death used by the body to delete unwanted cells without eliciting an immune response or inflammatory reaction. A hallmark of apoptosis is the activation of endonuclease that attacks the cell's genomic DNA at the linker regions that connect the nucleosomal units. Degradation of DNA produces DNA fragments in size multiples of 185 to 200 bp that can be observed as a distinct 'DNA ladder pattern'. Apoptotic cell death is gene-directed cell death.",1
9264246,"The evolutionarily conserved genomic organization of the Hox genes has been a puzzle ever since it was discovered that their order along the chromosome is similar to the order of their functional domains along the antero-posterior axis. Why has this colinearity been maintained throughout evolution? A close look at regulatory sequences from the mouse Hox clusters suggests that enhancer sharing between adjacent Hox genes may be one reason. Moreover, characterizing the activity of one of these mouse enhancers in Drosophila illustrates that despite many similarities, not all Hox clusters are built in the same way.",0
9223312,"Chromosomal translocations identified in hematopoietic and solid tumors result in deregulated expression of protooncogenes or creation of chimeric proteins with tumorigenic potential. In the pediatric solid tumor alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a consistent t(2;13)(q35;q14) or variant t(1;13)(p36;q14) translocation generates PAX3-FKHR or PAX7-FKHR fusion proteins, respectively. In this report, we demonstrate that in addition to functional alterations these translocations are associated with fusion product overexpression. Furthermore, PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR overexpression occurs by distinct mechanisms. Transcription of PAX3-FKHR is increased relative to wild-type PAX3 by a copy number-independent process. In contrast, PAX7-FKHR overexpression results from fusion gene amplification. Thus, gene-specific mechanisms were selected to overexpress PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, presumably due to differences in regulation between the wild-type loci. We postulate that these overexpression mechanisms ensure a critical level of gene product for the oncogenic effects of these fusions.",1
9215689,"Familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (FMEN1) is an autosomal dominant trait characterized by tumors of the parathyroids, gastro-intestinal endocrine tissue, anterior pituitary and other tissues. We recently cloned the MEN1 gene and confirmed its identity by finding mutations in FMEN1. We have now extended our mutation analysis to 34 more unrelated FMEN1 probands and to two related states, sporadic MEN1 and familial hyperparathyroidism. There was a high prevalence of heterozygous germline MEN1 mutations in sporadic MEN1 (8/11 cases) and in FMEN1 (47/50 probands). One case of sporadic MEN1 was proven to be a new MEN1 mutation. Eight different mutations were observed more than once in FMEN1. Forty different mutations (32 FMEN1 and eight sporadic MEN1) were distributed across the MEN1 gene. Most predicted loss of function of the encoded menin protein, supporting the prediction that MEN1 is a tumor suppressor gene. No MEN1 germline mutation was found in five probands with familial hyperparathyroidism, suggesting that familial hyperparathyroidism often is caused by mutation in another gene or gene(s).",1
9207791,"Dysregulation of oncogenes by translocation to the IgH locus (14q32) is a seminal event in the pathogenesis of B-cell tumours. In multiple myeloma (MM), translocations to the IgH locus have been reported at an incidence of 20-60%. For most translocations, the partner chromosome is unknown (14q+); for the others, a diverse array of chromosomal partners have been identified, with 11q13 (cyclin D1) the only chromosome that is frequently involved. Recently, we developed a Southern-blot assay that detects translocation breakpoint fragments in most MM tumours, including those with no translocation detected by conventional karyotyping. In a continuing analysis of translocation in 21 myeloma cell lines and primary tumours, we show that the novel, karyotypically silent translocation t(4;14)(p16.3;q32.3) is present in five lines and at least three of ten primary tumours. The chromosome-4 breakpoints are clustered in a 70-kb region centromeric to the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3), the apparent dysregulated oncogene. Two lines and one primary tumour with this translocation selectively express an FGFR3 allele containing activating mutations identified previously in thanatophoric dwarfism. We propose that after the t(4;14) translocation, somatic mutation during tumour progression frequently generates in FGFR3 protein that is active in the absence of ligand.",1
9197523,"The MAD (mothers against decapentaplegic)-related genes, Smad2 (former name MADR2 or JV18-1) and Smad4 (former name DPC4), have been identified on chromosome 18q21.1. We analyzed 30 primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) and 7 cell lines derived from ESCC for intragenic mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the Smad2 and Smad4 genes. LOH was detected in 5 of 14 (35%) informative cases. However, no mutations in either gene were detected in either the primary carcinomas or the cell lines, and only a G-to-A base transition within the 3'-untranslated region of the Smad4 gene was observed in a carcinoma. There were no homozygous deletions in either of the genes in the cell lines. MAD-related genes on chromosome 18q21.1 are altered infrequently in ESCC.",1
9159347,"Uterine sarcomas are unusual neoplasms of the female genital tract whose molecular etiology is largely unknown. We examined 20 leiomyomas as well as 23 uterine leiomyosarcomas for the presence of mutations in the Ki-ras and p53 genes, and overexpression of the MDM2 gene. Codons 12, 13, and 61 from the Ki-ras gene were characterized for the presence of mutations by restriction enzyme polymorphisms using mismatched primers and nucleic acid sequencing as appropriate. Activated Ki-ras genes were identified in 3/20 leiomyomas and 0/23 leiomyosarcomas. The p53 gene was analyzed by SSCP, nucleic acid sequencing, and immunohistochemical staining. None of 20 leiomyomas and 6/23 leiomyosarcomas exhibited p53 abnormalities. The SSCP/sequencing results did not consistently correlate with the IHC staining. MDM2 overexpression occurred in 0/20 leiomyomas and 3/23 sarcomas. Clinical correlation suggested that tumors with p53 mutations have a higher histologic grade or stage at presentation. We conclude that leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas have different patterns of molecular alterations and are separate biologic entities. In addition, p53 and MDM2 overexpression may play a role in the development of a subset of leiomyosarcomas.",1
9159152,"One of the most provocative recent discoveries in immunology was the description of a genetic linkage in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) between structurally unrelated genes whose products are involved in processing and presentation of antigens for recognition by T lymphocytes. Genes encoding MHC class I molecules, which bind and present at the cell surface proteolytic fragments of cytosolic proteins, are linked to nonhomologous genes whose products are involved in the production and subsequent transfer of such fragments into the endoplasmic reticulum. In mammals, the class I presentation and processing genes are found in different regions of the MHC. To examine the evolutionary origins of this genetic association, linkage studies were carried out with Xenopus, an amphibian last sharing an ancestor with mammals over 350 million years ago. In contrast to mammals, the single copy Xenopus class I gene is located between the class II and III regions, speculated to be in close linkage with the processing and transport genes. In addition to suggesting a primordial organization of genes involved in class I antigen presentation, these linkage studies further provide insight into the origins of the MHC class III region and the phenomenon of class I gene instability in the mammalian MHC.",1

9149143,"We introduce a general probabilistic model of the gene structure of human genomic sequences which incorporates descriptions of the basic transcriptional, translational and splicing signals, as well as length distributions and compositional features of exons, introns and intergenic regions. Distinct sets of model parameters are derived to account for the many substantial differences in gene density and structure observed in distinct C + G compositional regions of the human genome. In addition, new models of the donor and acceptor splice signals are described which capture potentially important dependencies between signal positions. The model is applied to the problem of gene identification in a computer program, GENSCAN, which identifies complete exon/intron structures of genes in genomic DNA. Novel features of the program include the capacity to predict multiple genes in a sequence, to deal with partial as well as complete genes, and to predict consistent sets of genes occurring on either or both DNA strands. GENSCAN is shown to have substantially higher accuracy than existing methods when tested on standardized sets of human and vertebrate genes, with 75 to 80% of exons identified exactly. The program is also capable of indicating fairly accurately the reliability of each predicted exon. Consistently high levels of accuracy are observed for sequences of differing C + G content and for distinct groups of vertebrates.",0
9143927,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormalities of tissues predominantly derived from the neural crest. Symptoms are highly variable and severity cannot be predicted, even within families. DNA of 84 unrelated patients with NF1, unselected for clinical features or severity, were screened with intragenic polymorphic repeat markers and by Southern analysis with cDNA probes. Deletions of the entire gene were detected in five patients from four unrelated families. Their phenotype resembled that of five previously reported patients with deletions, including intellectual impairment and dysmorphic features, but without an excessive number of dermal neurofibromas. This report supports the hypothesis that large deletions spanning the entire NF1 gene may lead to a specific phenotype.",1
9133447,"We have examined the roles of 2 putative tumor-suppressor genes, the p16 and p15 inhibitor-of-cyclin-dependent-kinase genes, in the most commonly occurring epithelial tumors of the human ovary. Expression of p16 mRNA, examined by RT-PCR, was significantly reduced in 15 of the 48 tumors. Aberrant expression of p16 protein, detected by immunohistochemistry, occurred in 22 of 60 tumors, more frequently in low-grade tumors, and had significant correlation with low p16 mRNA expression. Hypermethylation of a site within the 5'-CpG island of the p16 gene was significantly associated with loss of p16 mRNA and protein expression. Homozygous gene deletion, evaluated by differential PCR analysis, was found in 2 tumors for the p16 gene and in 1 tumor for the p15 gene among 70 ovarian tumors examined. PCR-SSCP analysis detected point mutations in p16 in 4 tumors and in p15 in 1 tumor. One was a 38-bp deletion, from codons 48 to 60, in a mucinous tumor of low malignant potential; another was a non-sense mutation in codon 60 in a mucinous adenocarcinoma. The remaining 2 mutations were mis-sense mutations, one in codon 58 and the other in codon 60, in 2 endometrioid adenocarcinomas. We conclude that inactivation of p16, by loss of p16 mRNA and protein expression as a consequence of hypermethylation of the 5'-CpG island, rather than by gene deletion or point mutation, may play an important role in the genesis of human ovarian epithelial tumors.",1
9116295,"Both p16 and p15, encoded by the genes located on chromosome 9p21, are inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4/6) and the upstream regulators of Rb function. In hematopoietic malignancies, deletion of p16/p15 locus has been shown to be highly specific to lymphoid, and more particularly from B-lineage malignancies except multiple myeloma (MM). To investigate whether these genes are inactivated by deletions, mutations, and hypermethylation of the 5' CpG islands, we examined 12 MM patients by Southern hybridization and polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. No deletions nor mutations of the p16 and p15 genes were found. However, hypermethylation was observed in 75% for p16 and 67% for p15 in our group of MM patients. Such high frequencies of involvement of these genes in MM make them hitherto the most common genetic abnormalities in this disease. Concomitant hypermethylation, uncommon thus far in the literature of the study of these genes, is a rather common phenomenon, occurring in 67% of our patient group. Moreover, hypermethylation of p16/p15 was associated with blastic disease and concomitant hypermethylation of both genes may be pathogenetically related to plasmacytoma development. These results indicate that these genes are important in MM pathogenesis. Here we report, for the first time in the literature, the high incidences of p16 and p15 alterations in MM, not by homozygous deletions or mutations, but solely by hypermethylation of the 5' CpG islands, which may be a specific mechanism in this disease.",1
9116284,"We describe here the molecular basis of an isolated hereditary giant platelet disorder (GPD) which is not accompanied with thrombocytopenia or leukocyte inclusion. Platelet aggregation with ristocetin and botrocetin was almost normal in this patient. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX complex was expressed on the platelet membranes at decreased levels. The amount of platelet GPIb alpha and the plasma glycocalicin concentration, the water-soluble extracellular portion of GPIb alpha, were also decreased. The anti-GPIb alpha antibody coprecipitated GPIb beta and GPIX, although the ratios of these polypeptides to GPIb alpha was greatly decreased compared with the ratio in normal platelets. Immunoblot analysis under nonreduced conditions showed that most of the GPIb alpha in the patient's platelets was not disulfide linked with GPIb beta. DNA sequencing analysis showed compound heterozygosity for two independent single nucleotide substitutions: from Tyr (TAC) to Cys (TGC) at residue 88, and from Ala (GCC) to Pro (CCC) at residue 108 in her GPIb beta gene. These substitutions were not found in genomic DNA samples from 108 normal individuals. These mutations might result in decreased expression of the GPIb/IX complex and may influence the association of the complex with the membrane skeleton, consequently impairing normal platelet morphology. Furthermore, the phenotype caused by mutations in the subunits of the GPIb/IX complex could span the spectrum from a normal phenotype, to isolated GPD, to a full-blown bleeding disorder, such as Bernard-Soulier syndrome.",1
9111168,"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by dyshematopoiesis with a frequent evolution to acute leukemia. Chromosomal deletions rather than translocations are the predominant karyotypic abnormalities in MDS, suggesting a recessive mechanism in the pathogenesis of MDS, such as inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. A group of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p15 (INK4B), p16 (INK4A), p18 (INK4C) and p19 (INK4D), are candidate tumor suppressor genes. To determine whether genetic alterations of these genes play an important role in the development and/or progression of MDS, we examined 46 samples from MDS patients by Southern blotting, single-strand-conformation polymorphism (SSCP) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of DNA. These samples included 13 refractory anemias (RA), four refractory anemias with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 16 refractory anemias with an excess of blasts (RAEB), eight refractory anemias with an excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) and five chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL) samples. Except for allelic polymorphisms or silent point mutations, no alterations of coding regions of these four CDKI genes were identified. In summary, genetic abnormalities of the p15, p16, p18 and p19 genes are rare events in the development and/or progression of MDS.",1
9098651,"Loss of p16 expression can occur via homozygous deletion, point mutation, or hypermethylation of exon 1. Astrocytomas representing all World Health Organization (WHO) grades of malignancy were analyzed in a correlative study using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis to detect deletions of the p16 gene together with immunohistochemistry to detect loss of the protein in archival specimens of the same tumors. Homozygous deletions of p16 were detected in 29% (15 of 52) of WHO grade 3 and 4 tumors. Immunostaining for p16 protein was present in 26 tumors retaining the p16 gene and absent in 11 tumors with deletions of the p16 gene. A close correlation was found between the two detection methods, with all tumors lacking immunostaining showing homozygous loss of the p16 gene. Astrocytomas exhibiting inactivation of the p16 gene most often contained p53 gene mutations or amplified epidermal growth factor receptor genes, genetic characteristics associated with both the progressive and de novo tumor variants. Immunohistochemical evaluation may be a useful, rapid method to screen astrocytomas for loss of p16 gene expression, regardless of the underlying mechanism leading to p16 gene inactivation.",1
9049067,"This contribution deals with two major issues on visual/spatial attention. One is the issue of facilitation and inhibition; that is, under what conditions facilitatory modulation occurs, and under what other conditions inhibitory modulation occurs. The other issue is that of spatial representation; in what type of spatial representation do these modulations occur, retinotopic or environmental? In the first half of this article, We review the latest studies employing various psychophysical measures to assess spatially-selective modulation of visual information processing. We also summarize our latest results on reaction time, indicating a dissociation of two visual functions, detection/orientation and feature discrimination. Based on these chunks of knowledge, we raise a questions about the spatial coordinate system in which the facilitatory and/or inhibitory modulations occur. We then provide results of two reaction-time experiments which partly answer the question.",0
9035045,"There is an urgent need for new antimycobacterial drugs, and in particular for novel agents that will shorten the duration of tuberculosis chemotherapy, or overcome drug-resistant strains of the causative organism, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Our knowledge of the tubercle bacillus and its complex interaction with the human host has improved dramatically in recent years, particularly with the determination of its complete genome sequence. New genome-scale tools are being applied to aid in drug target identification, alongside traditional approaches aimed at understanding the basic biology of M. tuberculosis. Many potential drug targets have been identified, but very few have been validated by showing that they are essential for growth or survival of the bacterium. In this review, the landscape of potential drug targets is surveyed.Structural Bioinformatic Approaches to the Discovery of New Antimycobacterial Drugs.",0
9033652,"To determine the role and mode of inactivation of the p16 and p15 genes in human esophageal tumors, we examined alterations and expression of the alpha and beta forms of the p16 gene, 5' CpG island methylation of p16 exon 1 alpha, and alterations of the p15 gene in 30 esophageal squamous-cell-carcinoma cell lines. Of 30 such cell lines examined, 28 (93%) showed aberrations of the alpha form of the p16 gene: 18 homozygous deletions, 6 point mutations and 4 hypermethylation. Methylation was exclusively observed in cell lines with the wild-type alpha form. Of the 6 point mutations, one was observed in exon 1 alpha, one in the splice acceptor site of intron 1 and the remaining 4 were in exon 2. In the beta form, 18 homozygous deletions and 3 point mutations in exon 2 were detected, but no point mutation was found in exon 1 beta. All mutations in exon 2 gave rise to premature termination codons in the reading frame of the alpha transcript, while no non-sense mutations were observed in the reading frame of the beta transcript. Among 12 cell lines without homozygous deletions of the alpha and beta forms of the p16 gene, the expected wild-type beta transcript was observed in 8 cell lines, whereas only one cell line expressed the expected wild-type alpha transcript. Homozygous deletions of the p15 gene were observed in 16 cell lines (53%), and no point mutations were detected. Twelve cell lines had alterations only in the alpha form of the p16 gene, while none showed aberrations exclusively in the p15 gene. Taken together, these results indicate that inactivation of the beta form of the p16 gene and the p15 gene are not so frequent as that of the alpha form of the p16 gene in ESC cell lines, suggesting that aberration of the alpha form of p16 gene is the primary target of 9p loss in ESC.",1
9030719,"Lactoperoxidase (LPO) is an oxidoreductase secreted into milk, and plays an important role in protecting the lactating mammary gland and the intestinal tract of the newborn infants against pathogenic microorganisms. In this study, the human LPO chromosomal gene was molecularly cloned, and its gene organization was determined. The human LPO gene was found to be arranged with the myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene in a tail-to-tail manner. Similar to the human MPO and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) genes, the human LPO gene is split by 11 introns and spans 28 kb. Unlike most introns in mammalian gene, the 5' splice donor sequence of intron 11 starts with GC instead of GT. When the minigene comprised of exon 11, intron 11 and exon 12 of the human LPO gene was introduced into COS cells, the correct splicing of the intron was found, suggesting the intron 11 of the human LPO gene is functional. The coding sequence of human LPO consists of 2136 bp, and codes for a protein of 712 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of human LPO has 51% similarity with those of both human MPO and EPO, suggesting that these peroxidase genes have evolved from a common ancestral gene. On the other hand, the nucleotide sequences of the 5' promoter regions of these peroxidase genes exhibit no similarity among them, which agrees with their tissue-specific expression.",1
9020842,"Pleiomorphic adenoma of the salivary glands is a benign epithelial tumour occurring primarily in the major and minor salivary glands. It is by far the most common type of salivary gland tumour. Microscopically, pleiomorphic adenomas show a marked histological diversity with epithelial, myoepithelial and mesenchymal components in a variety of patterns. In addition to a cytogenetic subgroup with normal karyotypes, pleiomorphic adenomas are characterized by recurrent chromosome rearrangements, particularly reciprocal translocations, with breakpoints at 8q12, 3p21, and 12q13-15, in that order of frequency. The most common abnormality is a reciprocal t(3;8)(p21;q12). We here demonstrate that the t(3;8)(p21;q12) results in promoter swapping between PLAG1, a novel, developmentally regulated zinc finger gene at 8q12, and the constitutively expressed gene for beta-catenin (CTNNB1), a protein interface functioning in the WG/WNT signalling pathway and specification of cell fate during embryogenesis. Fusions occur in the 5'-non-coding regions of both genes, exchanging regulatory control elements while preserving the coding sequences. Due to the t(3;8)(p21;q12), PLAG1 is activated and expression levels of CTNNB1 are reduced. Activation of PLAG1 was also observed in an adenoma with a variant translocation t(8;15)(q12;q14). Our results indicate that PLAG1 activation due to promoter swapping is a crucial event in salivary gland tumourigenesis.",1
9020840,"A candidate gene for Branchio-Oto-Renal (BOR) syndrome was identified at chromosome 8q13.3 by positional cloning and shown to underlie the disease. This gene is a human homologue of the Drosophila eyes absent gene (eya), and was therefore called EYA1. A highly conserved 271-amino acid C-terminal region was also found in the products of two other human genes (EYA2 and EYA3), demonstrating the existence of a novel gene family. The expression pattern of the murine EYA1 orthologue, Eya1, suggests a role in the development of all components of the inner ear, from the emergence of the otic placode. In the developing kidney, the expression pattern is indicative of a role for Eya1 in the metanephric cells surrounding the 'just-divided' ureteric branches.",1

9000502,"For the growing fraction of human genes with identified functions there are often homologues known from invertebrates such as Drosophila. A survey of well established gene families from aldolases to zinc finger transcription factors reveals that usually a single invertebrate gene corresponds to up to four equally related vertebrate genes on different chromosomes. This pattern was before widely noticed for the Hox gene clusters but appears to be more general. Genome quadruplication by two rounds of hybridisation is discussed as a simple biological mechanism that could have provided the necessary raw material for the success of vertebrate evolution.",0
8994842,"Phylogenetic analyses and sequence surveys of developmental regulator gene families indicate that two large-scale gene duplications, most likely genome duplications, occurred in ancestors of vertebrates.

8988165,"Holt-Oram syndrome is characterized by upper limb malformations and cardiac septation defects. Here, we demonstrate that mutations in the human TBX5 gene underlie this disorder. TBX5 was cloned from the disease locus on human chromosome 12q24.1 and identified as a member of the T-box transcription factor family. A nonsense mutation in TBX5 causes Holt-Oram syndrome in affected members of one family; a TBX5 missense mutation was identified in affected members of another. We conclude that TBX5 is critical for limb and heart development and suggest that haploinsufficiency of TBX5 causes Holt-Oram syndrome.",1
8980489,"Introducing a foreign gene into a new plant host does not always result in a high level of expression of the incoming gene. Numerous promoters have been used to express foreign genes in different plant tissues, but there are sometime various features of the new gene which are deleterious to expression in the new host. There are a number of post-transcriptional steps in the expression of a gene and sometimes sequences present in a particular coding region can resemble the signals which initiate these processing steps. When aberrantly carried out, these steps diminish the level of expression. By removing such fortuitous signals, one can dramatically increase expression of a transgene in plants. Ensuring proper protein folding and/or targeting the protein product to a particular cellular compartment can also be used to increase the level of protein obtained. The various methods used to optimize expression of a foreign gene in plants by concentrating on post-transcriptional events are discussed.",0
8980248,"To define the involvement of p16/CDKN2 and p15/MTS2 inactivation in ovarian tumorigenesis and the association of these inactivation events with histological types and clinical stages of ovarian tumors, we analyzed homozygous deletion and somatic mutation of p16/CDKN2 and p15/MTS2 genes, as well as hypermethylation of the 5'-CpG island of the p16/CDKN2 gene, in 49 primary ovarian tumors and 6 ovarian carcinoma cell lines. We found homozygous deletions of p16/CDKN2 and p15/MTS2 in 6 (12%) and 5 (10%) primary tumors, respectively. Somatic mutation of p16/CDKN2 was found in only 1 primary tumor, but mutation of p15/MTS2 was not detected in any sample. None of the 28 primary tumors or 6 cell lines was hypermethylated at the 5'-CpG island of p16/CDKN2. The incidence of inactivation of p16/CDKN2 in primary tumors was significantly higher in the advanced stages (7 of 29) than in the early stages (0 of 14). Seven of 9 alterations in p16/CDKN2 and p15/MTS2 were observed in serous (3 of 12), endometrioid (3 of 9) and clear-cell (1 of 4) carcinomas. However, only normal sequences of these genes were detected in mucinous carcinomas. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the IFNA locus was detected in 1 of 19 (5%) tumors, but no change at the D9S171 locus was observed in 17 tumors. These results suggest that: (i) homozygous deletion is the main mechanism of inactivation of p16/CDKN2 and p15/MTS2 in ovarian tumorigenesis; (ii) inactivation of p16/CDKN2 and p15/MTS2 may be the histological type-specific events involved in ovarian tumorigenesis; and (iii) inactivation of p16/CDKN2 is potentially involved in the progression of ovarian tumors in advanced stages.",1
8978036,"The A mating type locus of Coprinus cinereus is remarkable for its extreme diversity, with over 100 different alleles in natural populations. Classical genetic studies have demonstrated that this hypervariability arises in part from recombination between two subloci of A, alpha and beta, although more recent population genetic data have indicated a third segregating sublocus. In this study, we characterized the molecular basis by which recombination generates nonparental A mating types. We mapped the frequency and location of all recombination events in two crosses and correlated the genetic and physical maps of A. We found that all recombination events were located in 6 kb of noncoding DNA between the alpha and beta subloci and that the rate of recombination in this noncoding region matched that generally observed for this genome. No recombination within gene clusters or within coding regions was observed, and the two alpha and beta subloci described in genetic analyses correlated with the previously characterized alpha and beta gene clusters. We propose that pairs of genes constitute both the sex determining and the hereditary unit of A.",0
8957064,"Because combined hepatocellular-cholangiocellular carcinoma is rare and its biological features and pathogenesis have not been well established, we investigated alterations of the p53, K-ras and Rb-1 genes, as well as expression patterns of carcinoembryonic antigen and keratin, in seven combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinomas out of 557 hepatocellular carcinomas autopsied at Tokyo University during 30 years. Mutations of the p53 gene were found in two cases, at codon 244 (GGC to TGC) in the cholangiocellular carcinoma component of case 1 (mixed type, showing an intimate intermingling of both elements) and at codon 234 (TAC to AAC) in both components of case 5 (combined type, consisting of contiguous but independent masses of both elements). Mutation of the K-ras gene (codon 12, GGT to GAT) was seen only in the cholangiocellular carcinoma component of clinically apparent double cancer, case 6. Allelic alteration of the Rb-1 gene was observed in two cases, deletion of both alleles in the hepatocellular carcinoma component of case 3 (combined type) and replication error of the same pattern in both components of case 4 (mixed type). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the hepatocellular carcinoma components of five cases (cases 2, 3, 5, 6, 7) were immunoreactive for keratin, suggesting biliary epithelial transformation. In four of the five cases (cases 3 and 5 combined, case 7 mixed and case 6 double cancer), cholangiocellular carcinoma components were also positive for keratin. These results suggest that both components of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma have the same genetic and phenotypic character and might have arisen from the same origin in some cases.",1
8948029,"The levels of expression and the incidence of codon 12 point mutations of the ras family genes were studied in 18 cases of leukemia, seven with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), three with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), four cases with chronic myelogenic leukemia (CML) and four cases with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Elevated expression of the ras genes was found for 39%, 61% and 67% of the specimens for the H-ras, K-ras and N-ras, respectively. A trend was found between the overexpression of the N-ras gene and the acute leukemias: all 10 acute leukemias exhibited overexpression of the N-ras gene, while only two of the CML cases, both in blastic crisis, showed elevated levels of the N-ras gene. Codon 12 point mutations at the N-ras gene were found in two of seven cases (28%) with AML and one of four cases (25%) with CML. The only K-ras codon 12 point mutation was found in a patient with CLL. No mutations were found in the codon 12 of H-ras. Our data suggest that apart from the point mutations, overexpression of the ras family genes is important in the development of the disease.",1
8945609,"India has one of the world's highest incidences of oral cancer. It is believed that the widespread habit of betel quid chewing is an important risk factor as it exposes the oral mucosa to known carcinogens. It also induces physical abrasions, which may create mitogenic environments during wound healing as gateways for infections. A recent study from our laboratories identified human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, mostly of the high-risk types HPV-16 and HPV-18, in 67 of 91 oral cancer lesions from a cohort of Indian patients consisting mostly of betel quid users. This suggested a viral etiology of some lesions but tumorigenesis in the absence of viruses in other lesions. Here, we examined whether the p53 gene, whose function is abrogated by the product of the HPV gene E6, would be mutated in those oral cancers that were free of HPV DNA, and we found point mutations at known hot spots for mutational alteration of p53 in 4 of 23 lesions. We also considered the possibility that p21, a target of regulation by the p53 protein, may be mutationally altered in tumors with a functional p53 gene. While we did not identify mutations in the p21 gene, 6 of 11 lesions contained a polymorphism that may be associated with cancer. Interestingly, 3 of 23 lesions had mutations in the p16 gene, a third regulator of the cell cycle which is frequently mutated in melanoma but rarely in other cancers, with 1 lesion even having a mutation in the p53 as well as in the p16 gene. Our data point to p53 and p16 as gene targets of oral carcinogenesis, with chemicals in the betel quid possibly functioning in these tumors as carcinogens.",1
8899723,"Support for contradictory phylogenies is often obtained when molecular sequence data from different genes is used to reconstruct phylogenetic histories. Contradictory phylogenies can result from many data anomalies including unrecognized paralogy. Paralogy, defined as the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree from a mixture of genes generated by duplications, has generally not been formally included in phylogenetic reconstructions. Here we undertake the task of reconstructing a single most likely evolutionary relationship among a range of taxa from a large set of apparently inconsistent gene trees. Under the assumption that differences among gene trees can be explained by gene duplications, and consequent losses, we have developed a method to obtain the global phylogeny minimizing the total number of postulated duplications and losses and to trace back such individual gene duplications to global genome duplications. We have used this method to infer the most likely phylogenetic relationship among 16 major higher eukaryotic taxa from the sequences of 53 different genes. Only five independent genome duplication events need to be postulated in order to explain the inconsistencies among these trees.",0
8895759,"Although homozygous deletions of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2 gene p16INK4a on 9p21 have been reported frequently in metastatic melanoma cell lines, and intragenic mutations within the p16INK4a gene have been detected in familial melanoma kindreds, specific targeting of this gene in the development of sporadic melanoma in vivo remains controversial. Southern analyses were performed in this study to initially assess the frequency of hemi- or homozygous losses of p16INK4a, as well as its neighboring family member, p15INK4b, and other candidate regions within 9p21, in sporadic melanoma. Overall, 22 of 40 (55%) uncultured sporadic melanoma DNAs were determined to harbor deletions of 1-11 markers/genes located on 9p21. This included 10 tumors (25%; 10 of 40) with homozygous deletions limited to either the p16INK4a gene only (20%; 2 of 10), both the p16INK4a and p15INK4b genes (10%; 1 of 10), another novel 9p21 gene, FB19 (10%; 1 of 10), or all three of these genes plus surrounding markers (60%; 6 of 10). In subsequent single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing analyses, intragenic mutations in the p16INK4a gene were also revealed in two (10%; 2 of 21) melanoma DNAs that retained one copy of this locus. By comparison, the frequency of pl6INK4a and p15INK4b homozygous deletions, as well as p16INK4a mutations, in melanoma cell lines (analyzed in parallel) was 2-3-fold higher at 61 (23 of 38) and 24% (9 of 38), respectively. These findings indicate that (a) p16INK4a is inactivated in vivo in over one-fourth (27.5%; 11 of 40) of sporadic melanomas; (b) mutation/deletion of p16INK4a may confer a selective growth advantage in vitro; and (c) other 9p21 tumor suppressor genes could be targeted during the development of melanoma.",1
8882883,"To investigate the molecular mechanism of gastric carcinogenesis, we analyzed genetic instability and p53 gene mutations in 40 primary gastric carcinomas. Tumor samples were from untreated patients with no family history suggestive of genetic predisposition to cancer. We screened six microsatellite loci by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, and exons 5-8 of the p53 gene by the PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing techniques. Microsatellite instability was detected in 32.5% (13/40), and gene mutations in 40% (16/40), of the tumors analyzed. No statistically significant associations were found between genetic alterations and clinico-pathological variables (with the exception of diffusion of lymph node metastases, which was inversely associated with the presence of microsatellite alterations; P < 0.01). Interestingly, a negative association was found between genetic instability and p53 gene mutations: 11 out of 13 tumors showing instability proved to carry a nonmutated p53 gene versus 2/13 carrying a mutated gene (P = 0.03). These observations suggest that genetic instability and p53 gene mutations play a crucial role in the gastric carcinogenic process, but likely act through distinct pathways during cancer development. However, genetic instability is not in and of itself neoplastic. Therefore, we investigated whether insertion/deletion mutations of the polyadenine tract within the transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor gene (TGF-beta RII) were frequently present in gastric tumors with an RER+ (replication error) phenotype. We found RII mutations in 8/40 (20%) samples: mutations were present in 7/13 (54%) RER+ tumors versus 1/27 (4%) RER- cases (P < 0.001).",1
8873383,"Homozygous and hemizygous deletions of 9p21 are the earliest and most common genetic alteration in bladder cancer. The identification of two cell cycle regulators, CDKN2 and CDKN2B, that map to the common region of deletion has prompted the hypothesis that they are critical tumor suppressor genes in this malignancy. However, controversy as to whether these genes are the only or even the most important target in bladder cancer oncogenesis remains. To more clearly determine the effect of these 9p21 alterations, we mapped the homozygous deletions and performed a detailed mutational and expression analysis for CDKN2, CDKN2B and a closely linked gene, methylthioadenoside phosphorylase (MTAP), in 16 established bladder cancer cell lines. Nine of the 16 lines exhibit large (30 to > 2000 kb) homozygous deletions on 9p21. All deletions include at least one exon of CDKN2, eight of nine include CDKN2B, and six of nine include MTAP. MTAP function correlates with the genomic deletions. SSCP and sequence analysis does not reveal any inactivating point mutations of CDKN2 or of CDKN2B in any of the cell lines without homozygous deletions, and all express the CDKN2 and the CDKN2B mRNA as well as the encoded p16 protein. The p16 protein levels vary widely and are correlated with absent pRb expression. We conclude that the 9p21 deletions in bladder cancer usually inactivate the CDKN2. CDKN2B, and MTAP genes but that CDKN2 is the most common target. Other mechanisms for inactivating this gene in bladder cancer appear to be uncommon.",1
8868065,"One of the most surprising observations made in plant science in recent years is the inactivation of transgenes triggered by interactions between DNA repeats. In plants, we can differentiate between transcriptional silencing, most likely reflecting a regulation at the DNA level, and post-transcriptional silencing that affects steady state RNA levels. In the filamentous fungi Ascobolus immersus and Neurospora crassa, we find two premeiotic silencing processes that are also based on the interaction of repeated sequences. A common feature of transcriptional silencing in plants and premeiotic gene inactivation in filamentous fungi is that the repeated sequences undergo cytosine methylation. DNA methylation, which is either the cause or the consequence of gene silencing, can be associated with changes in chromatin structure. These structural changes are reminiscent of homology-based silencing mechanisms in Drosophila, an organism that lacks DNA methylation. Repeat-induced silencing may therefore reflect the activity of an endogenous mechanism, present in some species, which screens for homology and has significant implications for the organization and evolution of the genome.",0
8855982,"We examined 26 gastric carcinomas from British patients for mutations of the APC gene using a single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and heteroduplex assay in conjunction with the protein truncation test (PTT). In addition, we performed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of the APC and MCC genes. We detected an inactivating somatic mutation in one gastric tumour. LOH of APC was observed in one of 12 informative cases (8%) and of MCC in two of 20 cases (10%). We thus find that alteration of the APC and MCC genes are infrequent in gastric cancers from the British population. Tumour-suppressor genes on other chromosomes must play a more significant role in the development of these tumours.",1
8855819,"Rearrangement and overexpression of the PRAD1/cyclin D1 oncogene, a cell cycle regulator, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a subset of parathyroid adenomas. Recently, two cell cycle regulators that inhibit the cyclin D1-associated kinases cdk4 and cdk6 have been identified: p16 and p15, the products of the INK4A (also known as CDKN2, MTS1) and INK4B (also known as MTS2) putative tumor suppressor genes located on 9p21. Because inactivation of the p16 or p15 genes might be expected to result in oncogenic consequences similar to those from cyclin D1 overexpression, we examined 25 parathyroid adenomas for 1) allelic loss of polymorphic DNA loci on chromosome arm 9p, 2) homozygous deletions of the p16 and p15 genes by Southern blot analysis, and 3) mutations of the p16 and p15 genes by single strand conformational polymorphism analysis. Heterozygous allelic loss at 9p was observed in 4 of 25 adenomas (16%); their smallest shared region of deletion was 9p21-pter, which includes both the p16 and p15 genes. However, single strand conformational polymorphism analysis of all 3 exons of the p16 gene and both exons of the p15 gene failed to demonstrate mutation in any of the 25 cases, and homozygous deletions of the p16 and p15 genes, which are present in some human cancers, were not found in any parathyroid tumors. These observations indicate that inactivating mutations or homozygous deletions of the p16 and p15 genes occur uncommonly, if ever, in parathyroid adenomas; however, loss of a different tumor suppressor gene (or genes) on 9p appears to contribute to the pathogenesis of a significant percentage of these tumors.",1
8829653,"Germline and somatic mutations in the p53 and APC genes contribute to neoplasia. The patterns of these and other acquired mutations in cancers reflect environmental mutagens and endogenous factors that contribute to carcinogenesis. Herein, we describe a database of almost 2,300 mutations in the p53 and APC genes published until September 1, 1993. In addition to cataloging the mutations, multiple fields of information have been added to facilitate future molecular epidemiological analyses of human cancer. The accuracy of the database has been checked by the present authors and, by soliciting feedback from the original corresponding authors. The strengths and limitations of the primary literature are discussed.",1
8826861,"A common characteristic of cancer cells is unrestrained cell division. This may be caused by mutational changes in genes coding for components of cell cycle-controlling networks. Alterations in genes involved in G1 checkpoint control have been registered in many human tumours, and investigations from several laboratories show that such alterations, taken together, are the most frequent changes detected in cancer cells. The present paper describes mutational analysis by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR/SSCP) and nucleotide sequence analysis of the genes coding for the p15, p53 and N-ras proteins in 26 metastases from 25 melanoma patients. The registered mutation frequencies add together with previously registered mutations in p16 in the same patient samples to a substantial total frequency of 44% of patients with mutation in at least one of the investigated genes. These results show the occurrence of heterogeneous defects among components of the cell cycle controlling machinery in a human melanoma tumour sample collection and demonstrate that the total frequency of detected alterations increases with the number of cell cycle controlling genes included in the screening panel.",1
8817333,"X-linked non-specific mental retardation (MRX) is a heterogeneous condition in which mental retardation (MR) appears to be the only consistent manifestation. The genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity exclude any possibility of pooling families and, therefore, of fine-mapping the related disease genes. In order to identify genomic critical regions involved in the MRX condition assigned to Xp21.3-22.1 region, we have implemented the PCR screening of non fragile X MR patients for the presence of deletions in this region. The amplification by PCR of 12 markers located between POLA and DXS704 using genomic DNA from 192 MR males led to the identification, in a 9 year old mentally retarded boy, of a microdeletion which extends from DXS1202 to DXS1065. None of the known genes, POLA, MAGE genes cluster, DAX1, GK and DMD, that map in the Xp21.3-22.1 region is affected by this deletion. This approach, which could easily be applied to several other MRX loci, allowed not only a confirmation of the presence of a potential locus in Xp21.3-22.1 involved in non-specific mental retardation, but also a better definition of the genomic critical region corresponding to this locus.",1
8806696,"A series of 195 human gliomas were studied as to the status of their CDKN2A, CDK4 and RB1 genes. Among 120 glioblastomas, 40% had no wild-type CDKN2A gene, 12% amplified the CDK4 gene, and 14% had no wild-type RBI gene. With two exceptions, each tumour had only one of these abnormalities. Thus the majority of the glioblastomas (64%) had distinct genetic aberrations which would obviously disrupt the control of transition from G1 to the S-phase of the cell cycle. A further 30% had loss of one allele of the CDKN2A and/or RBI genes. Only seven (6%) glioblastomas had no abnormalities of these genes. Anaplastic astrocytomas showed similar changes to the glioblastomas but at lower frequencies-34% showing no aberrations of the genes analysed. The astrocytomas showed solely loss of one allele of the RBI gene in 28% of tumours, with retention of one wild-type copy. In the glioblastomas with no alterations of CDKN2A, CDK4 or RB1, several other genes (CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CDK6, E2F, CDK7, MYC and MYCN) whose products take part in cell cycle regulation were examined. No abnormalities were detected. Thus some aberration of the CDKN2A, CDK4 and RB1 genes appears to be almost obligatory in glioblastomas.",1

8778390,"Data on the wettability of long-term resilient denture base lining materials have previously been obtained by static methods. This study determined the dynamic contact angle of a range of long-term resilient lining materials and the surface free energy properties of these materials. This method was a rapid and convenient method for determining wettability parameters. The equilibrium contact angle revealed the Flexor and Novus materials to be the least wetted with the Molloplast-B material, and CoeSuper-Soft material was wetted similarly to Trevalon material. The contact angle hysteresis indicated that all the soft-lining materials tested would improve denture stability under dislodgment forces. The surface-free energies appeared to be similar for all the soft-lining materials but were significantly lower than that of Trevalon.",0
8772588,"Activating mutations encoding substitutions at positions Arg201 and Gln227 of the alpha-subunit of the stimulatory G protein. G10 have been found in about 40% of pituitary somatotroph tumors. Although the etiology of thyrotroph adenomas is unknown, their autonomous behavior and blunted response to stimulatory hypothalamic hormone superficially resemble those of somatotroph tumors. We hypothesized that a subset of thyrotroph tumors might be caused by dominant somatic mutations that lead to inappropriate activation of the Gq/phospholipase C beta/Ca2+/protein kinase C. pathway normally triggered by occupancy of the TRH receptor (TRHR). We, therefore, screened samples from nine thyrotroph tumors for the presence of activating mutations of the alpha q, alpha 11, and TRHR genes. Fragments of alpha q and alpha 11 complementary DNA encompassing residues (Arg183 and Gln209) that correspond to Arg201 and Gln227 of alpha q were amplified and sequenced. Temperature gradient gel electrophoresis was used to screen for heterozygous mutations in the TRHR coding sequence as well as for known alpha s mutations. No mutations were detected. We conclude that mutations in these regions of the alpha q, alpha 11, alpha s, and TRHR genes occur infrequently, if at all, in human thyrotroph tumors. Alternative mechanisms underlying thyrotroph tumorigenesis, including changes in the expression levels of G protein alpha-subunits or TRHR, dysregulation of downstream components, inappropriate activation of other stimulatory pathways, or loss of inhibitory inputs, remain to be explored.",1
8760309,"Abnormalities in the p16, p15 and CDK4 genes that regulate transition through the G1 phase of the cell cycle have been implicated in the malignant progression of astrocytomas. The results of the present study demonstrate that dysfunction of these genes also occurs during recurrence of glial tumors that were highly malignant at first presentation. Analysis of 10 matched pairs of high grade malignant astrocytomas and their subsequent recurrences identified three distinct groups. The primary and recurrent tumors in Group A did not show structural alterations in the p16, p15 or CDK4 genes, whereas homozygous codeletion of p16 and p15 was observed in both primary and recurrent tumors in Group B. The primary tumors in Group C had a normal profile of p16, p15 and CDK4 at presentation. Upon recurrence, however, the tumors sustained either deletion of p16 alone or codeletion of both p16 and p15 or amplification of CDK4. Analysis of the molecular differences between primary anaplastic astrocytomas/glioblastomas and their subsequent recurrences, which are clinically indistinguishable, may provide better therapeutic options for treatment.",1
8749397,"Homeotic genes controlling the identity of flower organs have been characterized in several plant species. To determine whether cells expressing these genes are specified to follow particular developmental fates, we have studied the pattern of cell lineages in developing flowers of Antirrhinum. Each flower has four whorls of organs, and progenitor cells of these can be marked at particular stages of development using a temperature-sensitive transposon. This allows the cell lineages in the flower to be followed, as well as giving information about rates of cell division.",0
8748019,"Any sample of genes traces back to a single common ancestor. Each gene also has other properties: its sequence, its geographic location and the phenotype and fitness of the organism that carries it. With sexual reproduction, different genes have different genealogies, which gives us much more information, but also greatly complicates population genetic analysis. We review the close relation between the distribution of genealogies and the classic theory of identity by descent in spatially structured populations, and develop a simple diffusion approximation to the distribution of coalescence times in a homogeneous two-dimensional habitat. This shows that when neighbourhood size is large (as in most populations) only a small fraction of pairs of genes are closely related, and only this fraction gives information about current rates of gene flow. The increase of spatial dispersion with lineage age is thus a poor estimator of gene flow. The bulk of the genealogy depends on the long-term history of the population; we discuss ways of inferring this history from the concordance between genealogies across loci.",0
8747595,"A recently identified gene, p16, located on chromosome 9p21, has been shown to be deleted and/or mutated in various types of human cancers. To investigate structural alterations of p16 and a neighboring gene, p15, we examined human bladder cancers for mutations in the entire coding region of these genes using polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis. Of 50 samples obtained from patients with bladder cancer, 3 (6%), all low-grade and superficial tumors, were found to have p16 gene alterations. The alterations included 1 missense mutation and 2 single-base deletions. We found no p15 gene mutations in these 50 bladder cancers. Our results suggested that p16 gene mutations, although they occurred at low frequency, are involved in some low-grade and early stage bladder cancers.",1
8745076,"The origin and evolution of intron-exon structures continue to be controversial topics. Two alternative theories, the 'exon theory of genes' and the 'insertional theory of introns', debate the presence or absence of introns in primordial genes. Both sides of the argument have focused on the positions of introns with respect to protein and gene structures. A new approach has emerged in the study of the evolution of intron-exon structures: a population analysis of genes. One example is the statistical analysis of intron phases--the position of introns within or between codons. This analysis detected a significant signal of exon shuffling in the DNA sequence database containing both ancient and modern exon sequences: intron phase correlations, that is, the association together within genes of introns of the same phase. The results of this analysis suggest that exon shuffling played an important role in the origin of both ancient and modern genes.",0
8724849,"As part of our continuing efforts to accumulate information on the coding region of unidentified human genes, we newly determined the sequences of 40 cDNA clones of human cell line KG-1 which correspond to relatively long and nearly full-length transcripts, and predicted the coding sequences of the corresponding genes, named KIAA0161 to 0200. The average size of the cDNA clones analyzed was approximately 5.0 kb. A computer search of the sequences in public databases indicated that the sequences of 20 genes were unrelated to any reported genes, while the remaining 20 genes carried sequences which show some similarities to known genes. Among the genes in the latter category, KIAA0167 contained a Zn-finger motif with significant structural similarity to that of the yeast transcription factor GCS1, and KIAA0189 was classified into the RhoGAP gene family. Stretches of typical CAG (Gln) repeats, which were often correlated with genetic disorders, were found in KIAA0181 and KIAA0192. Another novel repeat composed of alternating Arg and Glu was identified in KIAA0182. Northern hybridization analysis demonstrated that 10 genes are expressed in a cell- or tissue-specific manner.",0
8712952,"The impeller of the axial flow blood pump in an artificial heart is essentially based on the same principle as a marine propeller. Impellers designed for artificial hearts and marine propellers have a number of points in common. Decreased cavitation and relieved fluctuation load are only representative of them. As for a distinct concept of pressure distribution, the inverse method could be very useful. Skew may led to a more mild and natural character in the blood. Highly skewed blades and super elastic blades have the potential to decrease the burden on the entire circulatory system. This paper will address the main points and latest issues in propeller design concluding with a discussion of the implications of these issues for blood pump impellers.",0
8704193,"The first reported case of congenital Heinz body hemolytic anemia was subsequently shown to be caused by an unstable hemoglobin, Hb Bristol [beta 67(E11) Val-Asp]. This has become one of the classic models of an unstable hemoglobin, the hydrophilic aspartate disrupting the hydrophobic heme pocket. We have restudied this original case, who remains clinically well after nearly 50 years of severe hemolysis with a hemoglobin level of about 7 g/dL and two unrelated Japanese cases. Surprisingly, all three cases show the same DNA changes, predicting a valine to methionine change at beta 67, rather than the expected aspartate. Further analysis with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and globin chain biosynthesis strongly suggests that this anomaly is because of a novel posttranslational mechanism, with slow conversion of the translated methionine into an aspartate residue. The proximity of the heme and oxygen may be important in facilitating the reaction. These findings show the importance of complete characterization of variant hemoglobins using protein, DNA, and biosynthetic analyses.",1
8703847,"p16INK4A, p15INK4B, and p18 proteins are highly specific inhibitors of cyclin-dependent serine/threonine kinase (CDK) activities required for GI-S transition in the eukaryotic cell division cycle. Mutations, mainly homozygous deletions, of the CDKN2A (p16INK4A/MTSI) gene have been recently found in tumor cell lines and in many primary tumors. We looked for homozygous deletions of CDKN2A, CDKN2B (p15INK4B), and CDKN2C (p18) in 12 primary rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) specimens and in five cell lines established from this cancer type. By means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), we analyzed the presence of biallelic gene deletion or point mutation causing gene function loss. All the examined tumor cell lines (100%) and three of 12 (25%) primary tumors showed homozygous deletion of CDKN2A. Furthermore, no aberrant bands in primary tumors were detected via SSCP, suggesting the absence of mutations in the coding region. In all cases the deleted area at 9p21 also involved the CDKN2B gene. Conversely, no homozygous deletion or point mutations were detected when CDKN2C was analyzed. Our results strongly indicate that the p16INK4A (and/or p15INK4B) protein plays a key role in the development and/or progression of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma and suggest that this CDK-inhibitor protein might control proliferation and/or differentiation of human muscle cells. Moreover, alteration of CDKN2C does not appear to be involved in the genesis of rhabdomyosarcoma.",1
8695014,"Specific material recommendations for the restoration of root surface caries are difficult because of a lack of data on the clinical performance of restorative materials in these situations. Although silver amalgam has been successfully used to restore carious roots, resin composite, glass ionomer, and resin-modified glass ionomers are also used to restore root surfaces since they are esthetic and bond to tooth structure. Fluoride releasing materials may inhibit recurrent caries in restored surfaces; however, clinical documentation of this phenomenon is sparse. This paper describes the efficacy of restorative materials used to restore root surfaces, the dynamic movement of fluoride into and out of restorative materials, and the role that fluoride releasing materials may play in the inhibition of recurrent caries in vitro and in vivo. In addition, classifications are given for low, medium, and high caries risk patients and material recommendations are made for each category of patient.",0
8674005,"Alterations of the suppressor genes, such as the retinoblastoma (RB), p53, p16(CDKN2), and p15 genes, have been reported in human gliomas. These genes have been suggested as the cell cycle regulatory genes at the G1-S checkpoint.",1
8666397,"The mouse WASP gene, the homolog of the gene mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, has been isolated and sequenced. the predicted amino acid sequence is 86% identical to the human WASP sequence. A distinct feature of the mouse gene is an expanded polymorphic GGA trinucleotide repeat that codes for polyglycine and varies from 15 to 17 triplets in different Mus musculus strains. The genomic structure of the mouse WASP gene is expressed as an approximately 2.4-kb mRNA in thymus and spleen. Chromosomal mapping in an interspecific M. Musculus/M. spretus backcross placed the Wasp locus near the centromere of the mouse X chromosome, inseparable from Gata1, Tcfe3, and scurfy (sf). This localization makes Wasp a candidate for involvement in scurfy, a T cell-mediated fatal lymphoreticular disease of mice that has previously been proposed as a mouse homolog of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Northern analysis of sf tissue samples indicated the presence of WASP mRNA in liver and skin, presumably as a consequence of lymphocytic infiltration, but non abnormalities in the amount or size of mRNA present.",1
8656681,"The role of ras gene mutations in the progression of follicular lymphoma has been ascertained by SSCP-PCR and sequencing. A total of 40 transformed lymphomas were studied, 16 of which had a matched preceding low-grade biopsy. Only one transformed lymphoma was found to have a missense mutation at codon 12 of N-ras, resulting in an amino acid change of glycine to serine. We conclude that mutation within the ras gene family is a rare event in the transformation of follicular lymphoma.",1
8647414,"Maximum likelihood (ML) estimations of gene frequency, deduced from data on small pedigree samples, are considered. It is demonstrated that a range (""gap"") of possible values of gene frequency exists, within which no ML frequency estimation falls. The dependence of the size of this range on sample size is studied in samples consisting of nuclear pedigrees and pedigrees of a more complex structure. The practical importance of the effect revealed is discussed.",0
8630967,"Chromosomal abnormalities involving band 1p32, especially deletions, are frequent in neuroblastomas, indicating that a tumor suppressor gene(s) is localized at this region. The p18 gene, one of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) genes, maps to this chromosomal region. Complexes of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) play important roles in the cell cycle. CDKIs inhibit the kinase activities of these complexes and block transitions of the cell cycle. Some of the CDKI genes may be tumor suppressor genes. For example, the CDKI genes p16 and p15 are frequently deleted in various malignancies and are thought to contribute to cellular transformations.",1
8616035,"Recently the p16 and related p15 genes have been described as candidate tumour suppressors at chromosome 9p21. These genes have been found to be homozygously deleted at a high frequency in several types of solid tumours and also in acute lymphoid leukaemias. In order to determine whether these genes are more widely involved in haematological malignancies, we have investigated a total of 84 samples that did not have homozygous p16 or p15 deletions from patients with acute lymphoid leukaemia (n=13), acute myeloid leukaemia (n=24) and chronic myeloid leukaemia in blast crisis (n=43) as well as four haemopoietic cell lines. p15 and p16 exon 1 and exon 2 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), analysed by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and subsequently by sequencing. Within the p16 gene, a G-->A polymorphism at nucleotide 436 was found in 3/80 (4%) leukaemias and the cell line HL60. This cell line had also a C-->T mutation at nucleotide 232 which causes a premature stop codon. Analysis of the p15 gene revealed a C-->A mutation within the noncoding sequence 27 nucleotides upstream of exon 2 in 10/80 (13%) cases. These data show that inactivation of either the p15 or p16 gene by point mutation is a very uncommon event in acute leukaemias.",1
8603340,"Activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) by interaction with cyclins regulates progression through cell cycle checkpoints. This process is counterbalanced by CDK inhibitors (CDKIs), which can inhibit progression through the cell cycle. Because CDKI expression acts to inhibit cellular proliferation, CDKIs may have a role as tumor suppressors. One class of CDKIs, characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats, has at least four members (p15INK4B), p16INK4, p18, and p19). Two of these, p15INK4B, p16INK4, have been mapped to chromosome 9p21, a region of frequent loss in a wide variety of cancers. Alterations of p16INK4 have been detected in various tumors and cell lines. We analyzed p15INK4B, p16INK4, and p18 alterations in 52 osteosarcomas (including 11 explants), and 23 other various sarcomas. Single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis [polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSCP)] of the coding regions of these CDKI genes detected a missense mutation of p16INK4 exon 1 in one soft tissue sarcoma. Southern blotting detected complete deletion of p15INK4B and p16INK4 genes in osteosarcomas from 2 patients and a soft tissue sarcoma from another individual. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosome 9p21 was observed with a microsatellite probe closely linked to the INK4 genes in the latter case. Deletions of both p15INK4B and p16INK4 genes were detected in five of eight osteosarcoma cell lines. By contrast, no alterations of p18 were detected in any sample. Together these data suggest that alterations of the p15INK4B and p16INK4 genes, but not p18, may occur in approximately 5% of sarcomas. However, deletions of the p15INK4B and P16INK4 genes are frequent in osteosarcoma cell lines and probably have a role in tumor cell growth in culture. Notably, all seven detectable deletions involved both p15INK4B and p16INK4 genes, suggesting that both contribute individual tumor suppressor activity.",1
8603173,"The potential interaction between resin-based materials and glass ionomer cements was investigated by comparing the hardness of the non-adjacent surface of two different resin materials when cured over the cements. Control specimens were made by curing the resin materials over an acrylic surface. Two glass ionomer cements were tested and neither were shown to cause a significant reduction in the surface hardness of either of the resin based materials. The 0.5 mm thick specimens of both resin based materials were significantly softer than the thicker specimens irrespective of the base material.",0
8577849,"The maize homebox gene knotted1 (kn1) is expressed in vegetative and floral meristems and is down-regulated at the site of primordia formation. kn1-related genes from maize and other species also show meristem-specific expression and offer additional tools for studying the activities of shoot meristems. Members of this gene family are expressed early in embryogenesis, providing molecular markers for meristem initiation. Ectopic expression of either kn1 or a related Arabidopsis gene, KNAT1, causes dramatic alterations in Arabidopsis and tobacco leaf morphology. Most significantly, meristems form on the leaf, producing small shoots. We discuss whether the phenotypes can be interpreted as changes in positional information or timing of determination.",0
8570813,"Epidemiologic studies of racial differences sorely lack sound and explicit hypotheses. Race is a social convention, not a biological concept. Its careless use in epidemiology demonstrates a failure to generate appropriate hypotheses to study its role in health. Studies of hypertension in blacks illustrate the point. Two underlying pitfalls plague hypothesis generation: directionality involving the null and alternative hypotheses and circularity, where efforts to understand social factors have the effect of emphasizing racial differences. The proper prescription is to identify explicitly the hypotheses of interest, including their origins and implication.",0
8568860,"The induction of effector genes that encode enzymes is often controlled by the protein product of a regulator gene that is directly involved in the control of its own expression. This coupling of elementary gene circuits can lead to three patterns of regulator and effector gene expression. As effector gene expression increases, regulator gene expression can increase, remain the same, or decrease, and these are referred to as directly coupled, uncoupled, or inversely coupled patterns. To determine the relative merits of each pattern, we have constructed appropriate mathematical models for the alternative gene circuits and made well-controlled comparisons using a priori criteria to evaluate their functional effectiveness. We have considered both negatively and positively controlled systems that are induced by an intermediate of the regulated pathway. Different results are obtained in the two cases. Our results indicate that direct coupling is better than inverse coupling or uncoupling for negatively controlled systems, while inverse coupling is better than the other two patterns for positively controlled systems. These optimal forms of coupling promote a fast response to inducer. Our results also indicate that realization of the optimal forms of coupling is influenced by the subunit structure of regulator proteins and requires a low capacity for induction, i.e. the ratio of maximal to minimal level of effector gene expression is small. These results lead to testable predictions, which we have compared with experimental data from over 30 systems.",0
8556302,"L1 is a neuronal cell adhesion molecule with important functions in the development of the nervous system. The gene encoding L1 is located near the telomere of the long arm of the X chromosome in Xq28. We review here the evidence that several X-linked mental retardation syndromes including X-linked hydrocephalus (HSAS), MASA syndrome, X-linked complicated spastic paraparesis (SP1) and X-linked corpus callosum agenesis (ACC) are all due to mutations in the L1 gene. The inter- and intrafamilial variability in families with an L1 mutation is very wide, and patients with HSAS, MASA, SP1 and ACC can be present within the same family. Therefore, we propose here to refer to this clinical syndrome with the acronym CRASH, for Corpus callosum hypoplasia, Retardation, Adducted thumbs, Spastic paraplegia and Hydrocephalus.",1
8552053,"Statistical features of nucleotide sequences are analyzed for the redundancy of their sites, introns vs. exons. In human genes with known exon-intron structure, the introns were found to be more redundant than the exons. The redundancy was defined as the minimal length of a nucleotide sequence not repeated within a gene. Mechanisms alternating exon-intron statistical pattern are discussed.",0
8547074,"The genes MTS1/p16 and MTS2/p15 located in 9p21 encoding cyclin-dependent kinase-4 inhibitors are homozygously deleted in a number of different tumour cell lines. By PCR analysis of 30 cell lines, including 10 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 20 lymphoma cell lines, we found homozygous deletions of at least one locus in 11 (37%) cell lines. MTS1-specific sequences were deleted in 70% of ALL (reaching 86% in T-cell ALL) but in none of the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) cell lines. MTS2-specific sequences were deleted in 40% of ALL and 17% of NHL cell lines. We observed a higher frequency of MTS1 deletions in ALL than in NHL (P < 0.001) and in T-cell neoplasms compared to B-cell neoplasms (67% v 6%; P = 0.001). In ALL-derived cell lines deletions of the MTS2 gene only occurred in cases with MTS1 deletions but in NHL only in cases without MTS1 deletions.",1
8530105,"We have constructed a physical map covering over 4 Mb of human chromosome 8q24.1 and used this map to refine the locations of the genes responsible for Langer-Giedion syndrome. The map is composed of overlapping YAC clones that were identified and ordered in relation to sequence tagged sites mapped to the Langer-Giedion chromosomal region on somatic cell hybrids. The minimal region of overlap of Langer-Giedion syndrome deletions, previously identified by analysis of 15 patients, was placed on the map by analysis of 2 patients whose deletions define the endpoints. The chromosome 8 breakpoint of a balanced t(8;9)(q24.11;q33.3) translocation from a patient with trichorhinophalangeal syndrome (TRPS I) was found to be located just within the proximal end of the minimal deletion region. A deletion of 8q24.11-q24.3 in a patient with multiple exostoses was found to overlap the distal end of the LGS deletion region, indicating that the EXT1 gene is distal to the TRPS1 gene and supporting the hypothesis that Langer-Giedion syndrome is due to loss of functional copies of both the TRPS1 and the EXT1 genes.",1
8516848,"Recent studies indicate that different levels of control operate within multigene loci. In addition to regulatory sequences immediately flanking the genes, there are also elements that act over long distances on more than one gene. Competition for these elements among genes can influence both the level and timing of gene expression during development.",0
8506375,"Chromosomal translocations involving chromosome 3, band q27, are among the most common rearrangements in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. From a bacteriophage lambda library prepared from a lymphoma characterized by a t(3;14)(q27;q32), genomic clones were isolated using a probe from the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH) joining region. In addition to clones containing an apparently normal IGH rearrangement, others were found to contain one of the translocation breakpoint junctions. Normal chromosome 3 sequences and the reciprocal breakpoint junction were subsequently isolated. DNA probes on each side of the chromosome 3 breakpoint hybridized at high stringency to the DNA of various mammalian species, demonstrating evolutionary conservation. One such probe from the presumptive der(3) chromosome detected an 11-kilobase transcript when hybridized to RNA of B- and T-cell lines. A probe made from partial cDNA clones isolated from a T-cell line hybridized with genomic DNA from both sides of the chromosome 3 breakpoint, indicating that the t(3;14) is associated with a break within the gene on chromosome 3. In situ chromosomal hybridization revealed that the same gene is involved in the t(3;22)(q27;q11). Preliminary nucleotide sequencing shows no identity of the cDNA to gene sequences in available data banks. We propose the name BCL6 (B-cell lymphoma 6) for this gene, since it is likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of certain B-cell lymphomas.",1
8506309,"Chromosome translocations involving band 11q23 are associated with human acute leukemias. These translocations fuse the ALL-1 gene, homolog of Drosophila trithorax and located at chromosome band 11q23, to genes from a variety of chromosomes. We cloned and sequenced cDNAs derived from transcripts of the AF-4 and AF-9 genes involved in the most common chromosome abnormalities, t(4:11)(q21:q23) and t(9:11)(p22:q23), respectively. Sequence analysis indicates high homology between the AF-9 gene protein product and the protein encoded by the ENL gene fused to ALL-1 in (11:19) chromosome translocations. AF-4, AF-9, and ENL proteins contain nuclear targeting sequences as well as serine-rich and proline-rich regions. Stretches abundant in basic amino acids are also present in the three proteins. These results suggest that the different proteins fused to ALL-1 polypeptide(s) provide similar functional domains.",1
8459224,"Site-specific deletions in the tal-1 gene are reported to occur in 12-26% of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL). So far two main types of tal-1 deletions have been described. Upon analysis of 134 T-ALL we have found two new types of tal-1 deletions. These four types of deletions juxtapose the 5' part of the tal-1 gene to the sil gene promoter, thereby deleting all coding sil exons but leaving the coding tal-1 exons undamaged. The recombination signal sequences (RSS) and fusion regions of the tal-1 deletion breakpoints strongly resemble the RSS and junctional regions of immunoglobulin/T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements, which implies that they are probably caused by the same V(D)J recombinase complex. Analysis of the 134 T-ALL suggested that the occurrence of tal-1 deletions is associated with the CD3 phenotype, because no tal-1 deletions were found in 25 TCR-gamma/delta + T-ALL, whereas 8 of the 69 CD3- T-ALL and 11 of the 40 TCR-alpha/beta + T-ALL contained such a deletion. Careful examination of all TCR genes revealed that tal-1 deletions exclusively occurred in CD3- or CD3+ T-ALL of the alpha/beta lineage with a frequency of 18% in T-ALL with one deleted TCR-delta allele, and a frequency of 34% in T-ALL with TCR-delta gene deletions on both alleles. Therefore, we conclude that alpha/beta lineage commitment of the T-ALL and especially the extent of TCR-delta gene deletions determines the chance of a tal-1 deletion. This suggests that tal-1 deletions are mediated via the same deletion mechanism as TCR-delta gene deletions.",1
8444803,"Salmonella enterica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis are the only examples in nature known to use a variety of 3,6-dideoxyhexose derivatives as O antigen constituents. To allow a comparison of the responsible biosynthetic genes of the two organisms, we have sequenced a section of the Y. pseudotuberculosis serogroup IIA rfb region that contained the genes for the abequose biosynthetic pathway. Comparison of the identified genes with the rfb region of S. enterica LT2 showed that the two dideoxyhexose pathway gene clusters are related. The arrangement of the genes was largely conserved, and the G + C compositions of the two DNA regions were strikingly similar; however, the degree of conservation of nucleotide and protein sequences suggested that the two gene clusters have been evolving independently for considerable time. Hybridization experiments showed that the dideoxyhexose pathway genes are widespread throughout the various serogroups of Y. pseudotuberculosis.",0
8434604,"Genetic linkage analyses suggest that mutations in type II collagen may be responsible for Stickler syndrome, or arthro-ophthalmopathy (AO), in many families. In the present study oligonucleotide primers were developed to amplify and directly sequence eight of the first nine exons of the gene for type II procollagen (COL2A1). Analysis of the eight exons in 10 unrelated probands with AO revealed that one had a single-base mutation in one allele that changed the codon of -CGA- for arginine at amino acid position alpha 1-9 in exon 7 to a premature termination signal for translation. The second mutation found to cause AO was, therefore, similar to the first in that both created premature termination signals in the COL2A1 gene. Since mutations producing premature termination signals have not previously been detected in genes for fibrillar collagens, the results raise the possibility that such mutations in the COL2A1 gene are a common cause of AO.",1
8405980,"Comparison of Kullback's information on nuclear pedigrees with different numbers of offsprings was performed in a case when a marker gene was codominant and the recessive or dominant control with complete penetrance was supposed for the localized gene.

These conclusions are found to be invariant with respect to the recombination fraction value determined by the simple alternative hypothesis, to the population frequencies of the genes considered and, within certain limits, to the disequilibrium parameter values.",0
8393432,"Six of 39 sporadic Wilms tumors had gross homozygous or hemizygous WT1 and WIT1 deletions. Two Wilms tumor-aniridia-genitourinary abnormalities-mental retardation syndrome patients had total hemizygous WT1 and WIT1 deletions in both constitutional and nonsporadic type tumor cells. Four of the 8 tumors with WT1 and WIT1 deletions showed loss of constitutional heterozygosity (LOH) for markers limited to the 11p13 region. Seven of 19 Wilms tumors with neither WT1 nor WIT1 deletions also had LOH on 11p; 4 in the 11p15-11p13 region, one in the 11p15 and possibly also 11p13 regions, and two solely in the 11p15 region. Thus, 15 of the 41 Wilms tumors (37%) had WT1 and WIT1 deletions or LOH on 11p, and only 2 of the 27 tumors whose nonneoplastic normal tissues were available for study showed LOH limited to the 11p15 region. None of the 7 non-Wilms childhood renal tumors showed WT1 or WIT1 deletions, or LOH on 11p. These data suggest that Japanese Wilms tumors may be characterized by a higher incidence of the gross WT1 deletion and a lower incidence of LOH limited to the 11p15 region than the Caucasian counterparts. These molecular-genetic features may be contributing to the lower incidence of Wilms tumors in Japanese children than in Caucasian ones.",1
8353484,"Point mutations in the ras oncogenes are very common in lung cancers as well as in many of the other solid tumours. To effectively examine the occurrence of these mutations in a large number of tumour samples, we have applied denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) for the analysis of point mutations of the K-ras and N-ras genes, using GC-clamped, PCR-amplified DNA fragments. Among the 68 tumour DNA samples, we detected 14 mutations in the K-ras gene. This was 78% of the mutations identified by oligonucleotide hybridization. Altogether, eight of the nine different kinds of base substitutions found in the tumour samples were detected by the DGGE assay, representing substitutions at codons 12, 13, and 61 of the K-ras gene. Six of the detected mutations were guanine to thymine transversions at codon 12; this was the most common type of alteration. On the basis of our experience, the present non-radioactive DGGE analysis seems to be readily applicable for detection of the mutations in the K-ras and N-ras genes. Types of ras gene mutations frequent in adenocarcinomas of the lung are also discussed.",1
8352281,"Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS; basal cell nevus syndrome or Gorlin syndrome) is a cancer-predisposition syndrome characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and diverse developmental defects. The gene for NBCCS has been mapped to 9q23.1-q31 in North American and European families. In addition, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for genetic markers in this region has been detected in sporadic BCCs, indicating that the NBCCS gene is probably a tumor-suppressor gene. In this study we have determined that the NBCCS gene is also linked to this region in Australasian pedigrees and that there is no significant evidence of heterogeneity. We have defined the localization of the gene by multipoint and haplotype analysis of 15 families, using four microsatellite markers. LOH at these loci was detected in 50% of sporadic BCCs, a rate that is significantly higher than that in other skin lesions used as controls.",1
8348153,"The expression of the FMR-1 gene, which is implicated in fragile-X syndrome was investigated in human fetuses by in situ hybridization. In 8 and 9 week-old fetuses, FMR-1 mRNAs are expressed in proliferating and migrating cells of the nervous system, in the retina, and in several non-nervous tissues. In the brain of 25 week-old fetuses, FMR-1 mRNAs are produced in all nearly differenciated structures, with the highest level in cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis and in pyramidal neurons of hippocampus. The early transcription of FMR-1 gene and the distribution of FMR-1 mRNAs in human fetuses suggest that alterations of FMR-1 gene expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of fragile-X syndrome and especially the mental retardation.",1

8328160,"Perinatal statistics in an urban environment are analyzed over a 9-year period. Perinatal outcome parameters in 27,986 deliveries are analyzed. The number of prenatal visits, low birth weight, illicit drug use, perinatal mortality, race, and age are studied. Perinatal outcome worsened after 1986 for patients with less than five prenatal visits, but not for patients with adequate prenatal care. Adequacy of prenatal care, preventable perinatal mortality, and low birth weight rates worsened for all patients, but disproportionately for black patients. Pregnancies of women of aged 18 to 35 had the highest risk for adverse outcomes. These deteriorating perinatal statistics represent a serious social and public health challenge.",0
8324292,"The liver is an excellent tissue for the study of growth regulation because of its ability to regenerate by a process of compensatory growth following surgical resection or toxic injury. Much of the investigation on the mechanisms of hepatic growth has been done in partially hepatectomized animals in vivo and in hepatocytes in primary culture. Almost immediately after partial hepatectomy there are major changes in the binding capacity of transcription activators and in the expression of a relatively large number of genes. Many of the immediate early response gene products are themselves transcription activators and thus can multiply and propagate the initial gene activation process. An important issue in the regulation of liver growth is to identify growth factors that may play a role in hepatocyte replication in vivo. In addition to substances that are adjuvants in the mitogenic response at least three growth factors, EGF, TGF alpha, and HGF, are complete mitogens for hepatocytes in culture and appear to play important roles as stimulators of liver growth. We discuss data that indicate that none of these growth factors seems capable of causing a significant increase in DNA synthesis in quiescent hepatocytes in vivo. In contrast, EGF, TGF alpha, and HGF (both the monomer and the heterodimer) increase DNA synthesis in vivo in hepatocytes that have become ""competent"" to proliferate. We suggest that the competence process involves the activation of transcription factors and protooncogenes, and that during liver regeneration at least some of these changes precede rather than follow growth factor/ligand signaling. The available data suggest that the three growth factors by themselves may not trigger regeneration in strictly quiescent hepatocytes. There is now extensive evidence from work on TGF alpha in developing and regenerating liver as well as studies with transgenic animals to indicate that the factor may act as a cell cycle progression agent. We suggest that ""priming"" of hepatocytes after partial hepatectomy might have similarities to the widespread activation of genes observed in response to stimuli such as heat shock, ionic imbalances, and changes in redox potentials, and that TGF alpha and also probably the other growth factors act to make primed cells progress through the cycle and undergo DNA synthesis. TGF beta 1 is a potent antagonist to the mitogenic effects of these growth factors on cultured hepatocytes and could be an important factor for terminating the proliferative response of hepatocytes after partial hepatectomy. Although we have moved closer to finding ""on"" and ""off"" switches for regeneration, their precise identities and mechanisms remain elusive.",1
8321046,"We have investigated the involvement of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and RAS family proto-oncogenes in BCR/ABL-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD), including nine cases of myelosclerosis with myeloid metaplasia, four polycythemia vera, 10 essential thrombocythemia, one juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia, and eight BCR/ABL-negative chronic myeloid leukemia. Twenty-five samples were studied in the chronic phase, while seven samples were analyzed in the acute accelerated or blastic phase. The presence of mutations in p53 exons 5-9, as well as in N-, K-, H-Ras exons 1 and 2 (containing codons 12, 13, and 61) was tested by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) single strand conformation polymorphism technique and by PCR direct sequencing. In addition, restriction analysis was performed to screen for gross rearrangements within the p53 locus. Alterations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and Ras family proto-oncogenes were detected in 2/7 and 3/7 cases of acute phase BCR/ABL-negative CMPD, respectively, while consistently negative in all the chronic phase samples analyzed. These results suggest that p53 inactivation and/or Ras activation might play a role in acute transformation of BCR/ABL-negative CMPD.",1
8308905,"Cow stomach lysozyme genes have evolved in a mosaic pattern. The majority of the intronic and flanking sequences show an amount of sequence difference consistent with divergent evolution since duplication of the genes 40-50 million years ago. In contrast, exons 1, 2, and 4 and immediately adjacent intronic sequences differ little between genes and show evidence of recent concerted evolution. Exon 3 appears to be evolving divergently. The three characterized genes vary from 5.6 to 7.9 kilobases in length. Different distributions of repetitive DNA are found in each gene, which accounts for the majority of length differences between genes. The different distributions of repetitive DNA in each gene suggest the repetitive elements were inserted into each gene after the duplications that give rise to these three genes and provide additional support for divergent evolution for the majority of each gene. The observation that intronic and flanking sequences are evolving divergently suggests that the concerted evolution events involved in homogenizing the coding regions of lysozyme genes involve only one exon at a time. This model of concerted evolution would allow the shuffling of exon-sized pieces of information between genes, a phenomenon that may have aided in the early adaptive evolution of stomach lysozyme.",0
8306343,"Genetic alterations in the p53 and mdm2 genes have been reported to occur in soft tissue sarcomas. This study was designed to determine the prevalence and potential clinical value of detected molecular abnormalities and altered patterns of expression of mdm2 and p53 genes in adult soft tissue sarcomas. A cohort of 211 soft tissue sarcomas from adults that were both clinically and pathologically well characterized was analyzed. Monoclonal antibodies directed against mdm2 and p53 proteins were used to measure overexpression of these proteins in the nuclei of cells from sections of these tumors. Seventy-six of 207 tumors had abnormally high levels of mdm2 proteins and 56 of 211 tumors overexpressed p53 protein. Twenty-two cases had abnormally high levels of both mdm2 and p53 proteins based upon immunoreactivity with these antibodies. There was a striking statistically significant correlation between the overexpression of p53 and mdm2 proteins in the same tumor and poor survival (P < 0.05) of the patients. A group of 73 soft tissue sarcomas was chosen for analysis using Southern blots, single strand conformation polymorphisms, and direct DNA sequencing to confirm mdm2 gene amplifications and p53 mutations and correlate these with the results of the immunoreactivities. The overexpression of p53 and mdm2 proteins in the nuclei of tumor cells did not always correlate well with gene amplification at the mdm2 locus or mutation at the p53 gene. The possible reasons for these discrepancies are discussed.",1
8292051,"The androgen receptor (AR) gene contains a polymorphic CAG microsatellite that codes for a variable length of glutamine repeats in the AR protein. Microsatellite DNA sequences may be potential sites of genetic instability. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we screened 40 human prostate cancer specimens for expansions or deletions of this microsatellite. In one patient, nontumor DNA yielded a single PCR product, as expected for the AR, but the tumor DNA yielded two discrete products, one identical to normal, and a second smaller one. Direct sequencing revealed that the nontumor tissue contained 24 CAGs, whereas the tumor contained one fragment with 24 CAGs (wild-type) and a second fragment with 18 CAGs (mutant), representing a somatic contraction of the AR CAG repeat (CAG24-->CAG18) in the tumor. Interestingly, this patient manifested a paradoxical agonistic response to hormonal therapy with the antiandrogen flutamide.",1
8276277,"Molecular genetics, which has its roots mainly in the development of microbial genetics in the middle of this century, not only greatly facilitates investigations of essential cellular functions, but also offers a means to better understand evolutionary progress. Spontaneous mutagenesis, the driving force of biological evolution, depends on a multitude of mechanistically distinct processes, many of which are already quite well understood. Often, enzymes act as variation generators, and natural gene vectors help to spread functional domains, entire genes and groups of genes across natural isolation barriers. In this overview, particular attention is given to comparing three selected natural strategies for the generation of genetic diversity: nucleotide substitution, DNA rearrangements, and gene acquisition. All of these mechanisms, as well as many others, appear to fulfill their specific roles in microbial evolution. Rather than being the result of an accumulation of errors, biological evolution may depend on a multitude of specific biological functions, as well as on a certain degree of intrinsic structural flexibility of biological molecules.",0
8264246,"A model is analysed of cells containing independently replicating genes, which segregate randomly when the cell divides. We follow the fate of a primitive chromosome, in which two genes are linked, so that they replicate and segregate together. Such a chromosome increases in frequency in the population provided that (i) the two genes act synergistically, so that a cell containing at least one copy of each grows faster than a cell lacking one or other, and (ii) the number of genes per cell is small. The increase in frequency occurs even if the chromosome takes twice as long as an individual gene to replicate, giving a two-fold selective disadvantage within a cell. The increase occurs because a gene that is linked does not run the risk of finding itself, in the next generation, in a cell that lacks its synergistic partner.",0
8257096,"The potential risks of unintentional releases of genetically modified organisms, and the lack of predictable behavior of these in the environment, are the subject of considerable concern. This concern is accentuated in connection with the next phase of gene technology comprising deliberate releases. The possibilities of reducing such potential risks and increasing the predictability of the organisms are discussed for genetically engineered bacteria. Different approaches towards designing disabled strains without seriously reducing their beneficial effects are presented. Principally two types of strain design are discussed: actively contained bacteria based on the introduction of controlled suicide systems, and passively contained strains based on genetic interference with their survival under environmental-stress conditions.",0
8219094,"Various chimaeric promoter regions coupled to the uidA beta-glucuronidase gene were evaluated for transient expression strength following electroporation into sugar-cane (monocot) and carrot (dicot) protoplasts. Multiple enhancer elements increased expression in sugar-cane, by up to 400-fold for the artificial Emu promoter relative to the CaMV 35S promoter. The relative expression strengths of promoters varied substantially between the species. Sugar-cane also differed in some respects from previously tested species in the family Poaceae. For example, in sugar-cane the nopaline synthase and CaMV 35S promoters were of equivalent strength, and insertion of Adh1 intron 1 into the 5' transcribed region decreased expression strength.",0
8218513,"Since January 1985 James Pringle House, the genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic at London's Middlesex Hospital, has built up an extensive computerized patient database. Yearly statistics relating to 1) individual patients, 2) diagnoses, 3) attendances, and 4) an activity estimator (combining features of attendances and their corresponding diagnoses) are extracted. Each is assessed as a potential tool for quantifying the rising workload associated with the clinic's increased staffing levels and expanded services. Only the activity estimator identifies an upward trend, rising 26.3% from 1985-86 to 1991-92, caused largely by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B related attendances. This activity estimator could provide the basis for a workload reporting facility on all GUM computer systems. The 4 statistics exhibit other useful information, including a 21.0% rate of non-attendance (a substantial hidden addition to workload) and a strong allegiance to the clinic from patients residing outside of the local Health Authority region.",0

8198970,"In this study we have screened a series of 29 primary leiomyosarcomas for abnormalities of both the p53 gene and the MDM2 gene, which encodes a p53-associated protein. SSCP (single-strand conformation polymorphism) analysis and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA were used to establish that 6/29 tumours possessed point mutations of the p53 gene. Using a monoclonal antibody that recognises the p53 protein in immunohistochemical staining experiments, we observed overexpression of the p53 protein in five of the six tumours containing point mutations in the p53 gene. Southern analysis of tumour DNA revealed that 2/29 tumours demonstrated amplification of the MDM2 gene. When considered together, these results indicate that alterations in both the p53 gene and MDM2 gene are important in the development of a significant minority of leiomyosarcomas. In addition, we have demonstrated a significant association between the presence of abnormalities of the p53 gene or MDM2 genes in leiomyosarcomas and a more advanced clinicopathological stage (P = 0.03). We have also examined the role of the DCC tumour-suppressor gene in the development of human soft-tissue tumours in a variety of histological types. Except for evidence of a rearrangement in a single leiomyosarcoma cell line, SK-UT-1, we have found no direct evidence to support a role for mutation of the gene in the development of human soft-tissue tumours.",1

8183919,"Networks of transcriptional regulators have key roles in metazoan development. Important forces in the evolution of these networks are gene duplications and gene deletions, events that may change the spatiotemporal expression pattern of network genes. A measure for the probability of such changes after gene-duplication events is proposed. This measure is based on a simple mathematical model that describes such networks as dynamical systems and on properties of ensembles of these dynamical systems. It is predicted that this probability depends only on the fraction of genes duplicated in a single event and that it is largest if approximately 40% of the genes in a network are duplicated. This property is robust with respect to variations in model parameters. On these grounds, it is argued that (i) evolution of gene networks should preferentially occur either by duplication of single genes or by duplication of all genes involved in a network, and that (ii) tight linkage (""clustering"") or strong dispersal are the two evolutionarily most favorable forms of genomic organization of genes forming such networks.",0
8182933,"The role of loss or inactivation of the retinoblastoma (Rb1) and p53 tumor suppressor genes in the pathogenesis of various human malignancies has been well established, yet little is known regarding plasma cell dyscrasias. In the present study, the loss of Rb1 protein expression, and the presence of Rb1 gene rearrangements as well as the presence of p53 somatic mutations (exons 5 through 9) were investigated in a panel of plasma cell dyscrasias, including 15 monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (MGUS), 63 multiple myelomas (MM), and 18 plasma cell leukemias (PCL). In the same panel of cases, we established the frequency of ras oncogene mutations, the main genetic lesion associated with MM. We report that loss of Rb1 protein and p53 mutations are detectable in 34.7 and 9.8% of MM and PCL primary cases; no lesion was found in MGUS. In advanced stage MM, and PCL cases, Rb1 and p53 inactivation, as well as ras mutations were detected. Our findings show that Rb1 and p53 inactivation are associated with aggressive plasma cell dyscrasias, suggesting a role for these lesions in tumor progression rather than initiation.",1
8174239,"We discuss, from an industrial point of view, the scope and possibilities of recombinant DNA technology for ""diagnostic enzyme"" production and application. We describe the construction of enzyme-overproducing strains and show how to simplify downstream processing, increase product quality and process profitability, improve diagnostic enzyme properties, and adjust enzymes to harsh assay conditions. We also consider some safety and environmental aspects of enzyme production. Other aspects of diagnostic enzymes that we cover are the facilitation of enzyme purification by attachment of short amino acid tails, the introduction of tails or tags for site-specific conjugation or oriented immobilization, the construction of bi- or multifunctional enzymes, and the production of enzyme-based diagnostic tests as demonstrated by the homogeneous immunoassay system of CEDIA tests. We use as examples of diagnostic enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49), glucose oxidase (EC 1.1.3.4), alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1), alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20), pyruvate oxidase (EC 1.2.3.3), creatinase (EC 3.5.3.3), and beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23).",1
8132760,"The type IV collagen alpha 5 chain (COL4A5) gene of 88 unrelated male patients with X-linked Alport syndrome was tested for major gene rearrangements by Southern blot analysis, using COL4A5 cDNA probes. 14 different deletions were detected, providing a 16% deletion rate in the COL4A5 gene in the patient population. The deletions are dispersed all over the gene with different sizes, ranging from 1 kb to the complete absence of the gene (> 250 kb) in one patient. In four patients with intragenic deletions, absence of the alpha 3 (IV) chain in the glomerular basement membrane was demonstrated by immunohistochemical studies. This finding supports the hypothesis that abnormalities in the alpha 5 (IV) chain may prevent normal incorporation of the alpha 3 (IV) chain into the glomerular basement membrane. Direct sequencing of cDNA amplified from lymphoblast mRNA of four patients with internal gene deletions, using appropriate combinations of primers amplifying across the predicted boundaries of the deletions, allowed us to determine the effect of the genomic rearrangements on the transcripts and, by inference, on the alpha 5 (IV) chain. Regardless of the extent of deletion and of the putative protein product, the 14 deletions occur in patients with juvenile-type Alport syndrome.",1

8118388,"Healthy individuals have soluble (extracellular) DNA in their blood, and increased amounts are present in cancer patients. Here we report the detection of specific sequences of the cystic fibrosis and K-ras genes in plasma DNA from normal donors by amplification with the polymerase chain reaction. In addition, mutated K-ras sequences are identified by polymerase chain reaction utilizing allele-specific primers in the plasma or serum from three patients with pancreatic carcinoma that contain mutated K-ras genes. The mutations are confirmed by direct sequencing. These results indicate that sequences of single-copy genes can be identified in normal plasma and that the sequences of mutated oncogenes can be detected and identified with allele-specific amplification by polymerase chain reaction in plasma or serum from patients with malignant tumors containing identical mutated genes. Mutated oncogenes in plasma and serum may represent tumor markers that could be useful for diagnosis, determining response to treatment, and predicting prognosis.",1
8054975,"Little is known about inherited susceptibility to spontaneous germ cells tumours in humans or other species. The Ter mutation in laboratory mice is novel in that it acts codominantly to reduce germ cell numbers on many inbred strain backgrounds and to enhance dramatically inherited predisposition to spontaneous testicular teratocarcinomas in strain 129 inbred mice. We have adopted a PCR-based, DNA pooling method for mice with 'extreme' phenotypes (small testes versus normal-sized testes) to identify a candidate linkage to the Ter locus. Two independent mapping approaches confirmed this evidence for Ter linkage near D18Mit62 on mouse chromosome 18, and suggest a possible human homologue on chromosome 5q.",1
8033084,"Thirty-six primary renal cell carcinoma samples and one metastatic lymph node DNA sample were examined for mutations of H-, K-, and N-ras and p53 genes, and genomic instability at (AC)n, (CA)n.(GT)n, and (TA)n.(GT)n repeats. No mutations were noted for H-, K-, and N-ras genes and only 2 of all the samples (5.6%) showed mutations at exon 8 of the p53 gene. Differences in unrelated microsatellites for tumor and normal DNA were detected in 9 (25.0%) of the cases examined. Somatic alterations in seven microsatellites, D3S1228, D3S643, D5S107, LPL5GT, D9S63, D17S261, and DCC, were found in 1 (2.8%), 3 (8.3%), 2 (5.7%), 5 (14.7%), 3 (8.3%), 3 (8.3%), and 3 (8.3%) cases, respectively. Five of 26 (19.2%) clear cell type and 4 of 10 (40.0%) non-clear cell type patients showed DNA instability. Two of 11 (18.2%) grade 1, 5 of 20 (25.0%) grade 2, and 2 of 5 (40.0%) grade 3 patients showed abnormal patterns. One of 2 (50.0%) stage pT1, 4 of 24 (16.7%) stage pT2, and 4 of 10 (40.0%) stage pT3 patients were shown to have microsatellite instability. In 4 of 9 alteration-positive cases (44.4%), mutations in multiple microsatellites were observed. Alterations in microsatellite instability may be more common in non-clear cell type, high-grade, and high-stage renal cell carcinoma patients.",1
8001973,"The genes responsible for two X-linked diseases, the Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS) and juvenile retinoschisis (RS), have been previously mapped, through linkage studies, to an 8-cM region, in Xp22.1-p22.2, flanked distally by two tightly linked markers, DXS207 and DXS43, and proximally by DXS274. In the present study, five Genethon markers have been assigned to the (DXS207, DXS43)-DXS274 interval using somatic cell hybrids and a meiotic breakpoint panel and ordered together with three markers previously mapped to this region. A genetic map, which includes 13 loci and spans a distance of approximately 13 cM, was derived from linkage analysis using the CEPH families. The most likely locus order and map distances (in centimorgans) are Xpter-DXS16-(3.4)-(DXS207, DXS43, DXS1053)-(2.0)-(DXS999, DXS257)-(1.7)-AFM291 wf5-(1.4) - DXS443 - (2.0) - (DXS1229, DXS365) - (2.1) - (DXS1052, DXS274, DXS41)-Xcen. Analysis of multiply informative crossovers established AFM291 wf5 and DXS1052 as new flanking markers for CLS, which significantly reduces the candidate region for this disease gene to a 4- to 5-cM interval. Three markers, DXS443, DXS1229, and DXS365, mapping within this interval showed complete cosegregation with the disease phenotype, giving a multipoint lod score of 14.2. The present map provides the framework for constructing a YAC contig for the CLS and RS region and should be useful for refining the localization of other disease genes mapping to this region. The panel of somatic cell hybrids characterized for the present study has also allowed us to refine the localization of five genes (CALB3, GRPR, PDHA1, GLRA2, and PHKA2) and two expressed sequence tags (DXS1118E and DXS1006E) previously assigned to the Xp22 region.",1
7987828,"We have used molecular genetic methods to examine the status of cell cycle-inhibitory genes in human brain tumors. We found that p16 and a neighboring gene, p15, were often homozygously deleted in glioblastoma multiformes but not in medulloblastomas or ependymomas. The deletions occurred in both primary tumors and their derived xenografts, but no intragenic mutations in either of the two genes were found. The p15 gene was expressed in a more widespread pattern in normal tissues than p16, but the products of both genes had similar capacities to bind to cyclin D-dependent kinases 4 and 6. These data suggest that the target of deletion in glioblastoma multiforme includes both p15 and p16 genes. The reason that homozygous deletions, rather than intragenic mutations, are so common in these tumors may be that deletion is a more efficient mechanism for simultaneous inactivation of both genes.",1
7980482,"Considerable information about the process of pre-mRNA splicing has accumulated, but the mechanism by which highly accurate splicing is achieved is unresolved. Fifteen years ago we proposed that accuracy in splicing might depend on small RNA molecules (splicer RNAs) which hybridise across adjacent exon termini, or intron termini. Gene expression, including alternative splicing, could be controlled by the transcription of specific splicer RNA genes. We re-assess our model here, in the light of subsequent developments.",0

7959419,"Synaptic plasticity, a physiological basis of learning and memory, is mainly classified into two categories: 1) relatively short-term changes in electrical activities and 2) more long-lasting morphological changes in synapses. Studies on neuronal differentiation have provided detailed clarification of many of the morphological changes in synapses. Although it has been demonstrated that neuronal differentiation is induced by a variety of stimuli, the mechanism of neuronal differentiation has never been sequentially understood. Since there must be unknown factors relevant to these complicated processes, it is important to find and identify the novel intracellular factors that are able to induce the differentiation of neurons. Differential screening is useful cloning method to identify molecules without any information about their structures. Genes expressed in a distinct pattern among two or more groups, eg. different drug-treated cells, tissues and so on, can be isolated. To identify novel neuronal differentiation factors, we differentially screened approximately 500,000 primary clones from the cDNA library of NG108-15 cells treated with TPA and diBu-cAMP for 72 hr. Using two single strand cDNA probes, which were reverse-transcribed from poly(A)+ RNA, TA-20 was isolated from cells treated with TPA and diBu-cAMP (probe TA) or from cells treated with diBu-cAMP alone (probe A) for 72 hr. Clones that hybridized preferentially to the probe TA were further investigated by Southern and Northern blots. Thus the identified clone TA20 is a novel gene and plays functional roles as a neuronal differentiation factor.",0
7952890,"One expects that in DNA without protein coding function, stop codons (which constitute three of the 64 possible codons) should occur frequently in all reading frames, and that a long open reading frame (ORF) can be interpreted as a sign for the existence of a gene. We make a beginning on introducing quantitative measures of confidence into this inference--taking Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a sample case--and show that some common assumptions can reasonably be questioned. In particular we show that statistical support for the biological function of shorter ORFs listed as putative genes in recent papers is in fact very weak. This is an issue of practical as well as theoretical interest, since researching the function of a putative gene is difficult and expensive.",0
7951320,"Human synovial sarcomas contain a recurrent and specific chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2). By screening a synovial sarcoma cDNA library with a yeast artificial chromosome spanning the X chromosome breakpoint, we have identified a hybrid transcript that contains 5' sequences (designated SYT) mapping to chromosome 18 and 3' sequences (designated SSX) mapping to chromosome X. An SYT probe detected genomic rearrangements in 10/13 synovial sarcomas. Sequencing of cDNA clones shows that the normal SYT gene encodes a protein rich in glutamine, proline and glycine, and indicates that in synovial sarcoma rearrangement of the SYT gene results in the formation of an SYT-SSX fusion protein. Both SYT and SSX failed to exhibit significant homology to known gene sequences.",1
7934068,"Genetic aberrations were examined to assess the possible roles that p53 and retinoblastoma susceptibility genes might have played in the development of small cell cervical carcinomas. Cervical cancer tissues from 12 patients with small cell cervical carcinoma that were free of human papillomavirus were analyzed. The presence of mutational alterations were examined by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and by direct DNA sequencing. None of 12 small cell cervical carcinomas were found to contain mutations in regions of p53 and retinoblastoma susceptibility genes that were functionally important and where most mutations, in human tumors have been found. Furthermore, there was no evidence indicative of loss of heterozygosity of chromosome region 17p13 (in which p53 is located) in these tumors. These data seem to suggest that whereas mutant type of p53 and retinoblastoma susceptibility genes may exhibit ""oncogenic"" function in many human tumors, mutational inactivation of these genes may not be an important feature in the carcinogenic development of human papillomavirus-negative small cell cervical carcinomas.",1
7910149,"p24 antigen (p24 Ag) is usually not found in patients in the asymptomatic phase of HIV infection, mainly because it is bound to anti-p24 antibodies (p24 Ab), with which it forms immune complexes. Nine asymptomatic patients positive for HIV-1 antibodies (stage II CDC criteria) treated with r alpha-interferon were followed (7.5 +/- 0.5 months), and a basal and final sample were tested for p24 Ag immune complexes (p24 Ag-IC), free p24 Ag, p24 Ab, CD4 count, beta 2-microglobulin, properdin B factor, and C3 and C4 complement fractions. p24 Ag-IC was detected in 55.5% of the samples, whereas free p24 Ag was detected in 5.5%. The finding of no change or an increase in p24 Ag-IC serum levels may be considered a prognostic marker. We believe that p24 Ab cannot be used as a prognostic marker unless p24 Ag-IC detection is simultaneously evaluated.",1

The B function is represented by at least two genes. The Petunia homeotic gene green petal (gp) is essential for petal determination as demonstrated by a Petunia gp mutant that has sepals instead of petals. We have used ectopic expression of the gp gene as a tool to study flower development in Petunia. CaMV 35S-gp expression leads to homeotic conversion of sepals into petaloid organs when expressed early in development. This demonstrates that a single homeotic gene is sufficient to induce homeotic conversion of sepals to petals, suggesting that other petal determining genes are regulated in part by ectopically expressed gp. Indeed, two other MADS-box-containing genes, pmads 2 and fbp 1, which show homology to the Antirrhinum B function gene globosa, are activated in the converted petal tissue. Furthermore, our data provide evidence for autoregulation of gp expression in the petaloid tissue and uncover the role of gp in fusion of petal tissues.",1
7906398,"As part of our effort to sequence the 100-megabase (Mb) genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we have completed the nucleotide sequence of a contiguous 2,181,032 base pairs in the central gene cluster of chromosome III. Analysis of the finished sequence has indicated an average density of about one gene per five kilobases; comparison with the public sequence databases reveals similarities to previously known genes for about one gene in three. In addition, the genomic sequence contains several intriguing features, including putative gene duplications and a variety of other repeats with potential evolutionary implications.",0
7903205,"Aflatoxin B1 has been suggested as a causative agent for a G to T mutation at codon 249 in the p53 gene in human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) from southern Africa and Qidong in China. The objective of the present work was to test the hypothesis that exposure to aflatoxin B1 either alone or coincident with other environmental carcinogens might be associated with allelic losses occurring during development of human hepatocarcinogenesis in China. The HCCs were obtained from two different areas in China: Qidong, where exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and aflatoxin B1 is high; and Beijing, where exposure to HBV is high but that of aflatoxin B1 is low. We analyzed the tumors for mutations in the p53 gene and loss of heterozygosity for the p53, Rb, and APC genes and at marker loci on chromosomes 4, 13, and 16. Frequencies of mutation, loss, and aberration (mutation and loss) of the p53 gene in 25 HCCs from Qidong were 60, 58, and 80%, respectively. The frequencies in 9 HCCs from Beijing were 56, 57, and 78%. However, the frequency of a G to T transversion at codon 249 in HCCs from Qidong and Beijing were 52 and 0%, respectively. These data indicate that mutation and/or loss of heterozygosity in the p53 gene, independent of the 249 mutation, play a critical role in the development of hepatitis B virus-associated HCCs in China. Loss of the Rb and APC genes was observed in 44 and 7% of HCCs from Qidong, respectively. Allelic losses on chromosome 4 and especially on chromosome 16 were frequent in HCCs from Qidong but were not observed in HCCs from Beijing, while loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 13 occurred at similar frequency in both Qidong and Beijing. These results show a distinct difference in the pattern of allelic losses between HCCs in Qidong and Beijing and suggest that aflatoxin B1 and/or other environmental carcinogens may contribute to this difference.",1
7894481,"Major genes which cause tuberous sclerosis (TSC) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), known as TSC2 and PKD1 respectively, lie immediately adjacent to each other on chromosome 16p. Renal cysts are often found in TSC, but a specific renal phenotype, distinguished by the severity and infantile presentation of the cystic changes, is seen in a small proportion of cases. We have identified large deletions disrupting TSC2 and PKD1 in each of six such cases studied. Analysis of the deletions indicates that they inactivate PKD1, in contrast to the mutations reported in ADPKD patients, where in each case abnormal transcripts have been detected.",1
7873385,"To evaluate the use of molecular analysis as a complement to karyotypic analysis in the detection of specific chromosomal abnormalities, the occurrence of t(1;19)(q23;p13) and t(9;22)(q34;q11) was investigated by RT-PCR in 43 diagnostic acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cases in whom cytogenetic investigations had failed (32 cases) or showed only a normal karyotype (> or = 20 normal metaphases, 11 cases). One child (aged 14 years) and five adults (aged 18-60 years) were BCR-ABL positive on first round for M-BCR-ABL (one case) or m-BCR-ABL (one case), or on nested PCR for m-BCR-ABL (three cases). Co-expression of M-BCR-ABL (first-round PCR) and m-BCR-ABL (nested PCR was seen in one case. One m-BCR-ABL-positive case also expressed the E2A-PBX1 fusion transcript. Patients positive for the transcript(s) were older, had higher white blood cell counts and a significantly poorer event-free survival (P < 0.001) than those negative for the transcript.",1
7851779,"Anthocyanin pigmentation patterns in different plant species are controlled in part by members of the myc-like R regulatory gene family. We have examined the molecular evolution of this gene family in seven plant species. Three regions of the R protein show sequence conservation between monocot and dicot R genes. These regions encode the basic helix-loop-helix domain, as well as conserved N-terminal and C-terminal domains; mean replacement rates for these conserved regions are 1.02 x 10(-9) nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions per site per year. More than one-half of the protein, however, is diverging rapidly, with nonsynonymous substitution rates of 4.08 x 10(-9) substitutions per site per year. Detailed analysis of R homologs within the grasses (Poaceae) confirm that these variable regions are indeed evolving faster than the flanking conserved domains. Both nucleotide substitutions and small insertion/deletions contribute to the diversification of the variable regions within these regulatory genes. These results demonstrate that large tracts of sequence in these regulatory loci are evolving at a fairly rapid rate.",0
7843880,"It has been 20 years since the concepts that are now embraced in the term recombinant DNA technology were first described. The technology has been used to design new vaccines, and one product--that for hepatitis B--has been in widespread use for almost a decade. Several other engineered vaccines have shown considerable promise in laboratory trials. Nevertheless, the potential of the approach is still to be realized. This article describes the principles that are involved in the design of these new vaccines, focusing on those for hepatitis B and rabies.",0
7828987,"The series of genetic changes leading to malignancy in colorectal cancer is well reported. This includes mutational activation of the proto-oncogene Ki-ras and mutation/deletion of the p53 tumour suppressor gene. The frequency of these mutations was investigated in a panel of 52 colorectal cancer patients using a combination of immunocytochemistry and non-radioactive, digoxigenin-labelled in situ hybridisation. Sixty two per cent (32 of 52) of the study population were positive for p53 overexpression and 36% (19 of 52) positive for Ki-ras mutation. Twenty seven per cent (14 of 52) of the patients expressed both mutations. Mutation of either the p53 or the Ki-ras gene did not correlate with Dukes's stage, tumour differentiation or 5 year survival rate of the patients. Most of the rectal carcinoma specimens (11 of 15) showed p53 over-expression but the significance of this was not supported statistically. Thus detection of molecular changes is becoming more amenable to incorporation into routine histological carcinoma assessment because of the advent of non-radioactive labelling in in situ hybridisation and antibodies suitable for paraffin wax embedded specimens. The significance of these mutations in disease prognosis, however, remains questionable.",1
7768309,"Many aquatic invertebrates possess complex life cycles, which include a switch from a vegetative to a sexual mode of reproduction. While sexual reproduction is usually linked to slow rates of propagation, vegetative reproduction leads to high rates of clonal propagation and a fast increase in population size. I have attempted to identify developmental genes which are differentially expressed between sexually and vegetatively reproducing individuals. quantitative assays of the expression of those diagnostic genes could be applied to field samples to gain information on the reproductive status of the sample. Here I outline a general strategy for identifying and testing the usefulness of homeobox genes as candidates for regulatory genes whose expression patterns are indicative of a sexual or vegetative developmental phase.",0
7742529,"Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is associated with prior infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I). Twenty to 40 years often elapse from viral infection to overt ATL, suggesting that other genetic events must occur to produce frank leukemia. The p15 (MTS2) and p16 (CDKN2/MTS1) genes located on chromosome 9p have been implicated as candidate tumor-suppressor genes in several types of tumors. We examined for alterations of these genes in ATL using Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analyses. Both p15 and p16 genes were homozygously deleted in 4 of 23 acute/lymphomatous ATL (17%). An additional 3 (13%) and 4 (17%) acute/lymphomatous samples had hemizygous deletions in at least one exon of p15 and p16, respectively. One of 14 chronic ATL samples had a homozygously deleted p16 gene and another had a hemizygous deletion of p16. Neither homozygous nor hemizygous deletions of the p15 gene were found in chronic ATL. In total, 10 of 37 (27%) ATL samples had loss of the p15 and/or p16 genes. No point mutations of the p15 and p16 genes were found. The ATL patient with a homozygously deleted p16 in the chronic phase rapidly progressed to acute ATL and died within 6 months of the initial diagnosis. One instructive patient had no detectable deletion of the p15 and p16 genes during the chronic phase of ATL but had a homozygous deletions of both genes when she progressed to acute ATL. Our results suggest an association of p15/p16 deletions with development of acute ATL.",1
7703487,"This study characterizes a new congenital thrombocytopenia with mild hemorrhagic tendency occurring in a woman and her child with the following features. We found a deletion of the distal part of one chromosome 11 [del(11)q23.3-->qter] that was detected by cytogenetic analysis and confirmed by chromosome painting in the two patients and also an increased number of bone marrow megakaryocytes (MKs), including numerous micromegakaryocytes (mMKs) associated with a normal platelet life span. A normal number of MK colonies in culture was observed with one third of them containing a few large MKs; however, these were always associated with mMKs identified by immunologic staining. A massive cell lysis was observed at the end of the maturation. Fifteen percent of the platelets in the peripheral blood showed giant alpha-granules resulting from the fusion of alpha-granules. These giant granules, which appeared in red on giemsa stain, had a mean diameter of 1.5 microns and showed all markers (detected at electron microscopy by immunogold method) of matrix and alpha-granule membrane, ie, von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, CD41, CD62P (P-selectin); however, they differed from lysosomes because acid phosphatases were not present. These giant alpha-granules were unable to release their contents after stimulation by thrombin, in contrast to platelets with normal morphology. Abnormalities in bone marrow MK maturation that were detected at the electron microscopic level and that led to lysis of numerous MKs were responsible for thrombocytopenia and were similar in both patients. MK abnormalities are probably the consequence of the chromosome aberration. ETS 1 and FLI, two proto-oncogenes that appear to be essential with GATA1 for the normal expression of MK-specific genes, map to 11q23-q24 and are, thus, deleted in this thrombocytopenia. In conclusion, the association of all these abnormalities constitutes a new familial platelet disorder and may present a valuable model for exploring the role of some genes involved in the regulation of thrombopoiesis.",1
7678540,"N- and K-ras mutations at codons 12 and 13 were investigated using oligonucleotide hybridization analysis after PCR amplification and subsequent sequence analysis of the amplified DNA from the region of interest in the following prostatic primary and metastatic (met) carcinoma-derived cell lines: 1013L (primary), PC3 (bone met), DU145 (brain met), and LNCaP (lymph node met). We also examined fresh and archival primary and metastatic prostate tumor tissue and benign prostatic hypertrophy specimens. All prostatic cells and tissues examined contain at least one wild-type N- and K-ras allele with respect to codons 12 and 13. No mutations were found at N-ras codon 13. The only mutation seen in the prostatic cell lines and tissues was a K-ras codon 12 position II G-to-T transversion. Since these are established nonclonal cell lines that have adapted to tissue culture, it is possible that this mutation does not represent the mutational state of prostatic carcinoma in vivo. However, the lack of consistent mutation in the ras genes amplified directly from tumors suggests that when ras mutations occur during the progression of prostatic carcinoma, they are late-stage events not directly involved in the initial development of disease. Immunoprecipitation studies using pan-ras antibodies revealed no evidence of altered expression of Ras proteins.",1
7640366,"In this paper we first review literature on the performance of various promoters in monocotyledonous species. In general, promoters isolated from monocots show a higher activity in monocot species. Moreover, the presence of an intron between the promoter and reporter gene increases transcription levels. We used the same approach to study gene expression in Liliaceae. The activities of the CaMV 35S, maize Adh1-based pEmu, rice Act1 and maize Ubi promoters, coupled to the beta-glucuronidase (gus) reporter gene, were evaluated for transient gene expression upon particle bombardment of tissues of tobacco, rice, tulip, lily and leek. Although monocot promoters performed very well in rice tissues, the results of this study show that this cannot be generalized for other monocot species. The transcription inducing effects of monocot promoters were less pronounced or even absent in tissues of Liliaceae, while the presence of an intron between promoter and gus gene reduced promoter activity.",1
7637779,"Clusters of homeotic genes sculpt the morphology of animal body plans and body parts. Different body patterns may evolve through changes in homeotic gene number, regulation or function. Recent evidence suggests that homeotic gene clusters were duplicated early in vertebrate evolution, but the generation of arthropod and tetrapod diversity has largely involved regulatory changes in the expression of conserved arrays of homeotic genes and the evolution of interactions between homeotic proteins and the genes they regulate.",1
7630644,"Four cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors called p15, p16, p21 and p27 have been identified in mammals. Because these proteins participate in the control of cell cycle, they are potential targets for somatic mutations during carcinogenesis. In order to document the prevalence of p15 and p16 alterations in gliomas, we looked for loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 9p where these genes are localized. Allelic losses were observed in 31 of 44 investigated cases. In all cases they involved the p15/p16 locus. We then looked for mutations in the p16 and p15 genes in 46 gliomas. A total of three DNA variants were observed which were all present in the matched constitutional DNA. They may be unrelated to tumor development. A single somatic mutation was detected. It involved a C to G substitution in codon 93 of p16 and is predicted to change a threonine into an arginine. Taken together, these data indicate that inactivation by point mutation of these two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors is uncommon in glial tumor carcinogenesis, but that there may be a tumor suppressor gene on 9p in the vicinity of p16 and p15 genes.",1
7625781,"Suffering is a particularly human experience that often brings with it loneliness or alienation from others. The theory described in this article explains the mechanisms through which suffering affects an individual's sense of community and connectedness with others. The intricate patterns are explained to provide a basis for prescriptive nursing to prevent or reverse this loss of connectedness. First, the article develops the concept of suffering and its influences on relationship with the self and with others and the relationship of others with the sufferer. Then, the concept of alienation is developed in this context, its philosophical roots explored, and a continuum described that encompasses alienation through connectedness. Related concepts of separation, shame, and stigma are briefly described as partial cases of alienation of the sufferer that also show the pervasiveness of the phenomenon. Next, the personal characteristics of an individual who might help are developed through the concept of wisdom. Last, an explanation is given as to why care is the contextual framework through which alienation is reversed and connectedness achieved. Although suffering, alienation, and care have gone by many names, the essences of these phenomena have been recurrent theme in descriptions of human response.",0
7622530,"Blood-material interactions were studied using in vitro recirculation with human blood, slime-forming Staphylococcus epidermidis, and cardiovascular materials. Staphylococcus epidermidis, under preseeded or injected conditions, adhered to nonsmooth materials and elevated plasma levels of fibrinopeptide A (FpA) and C3a in the presence of all materials. Increased white blood cell (WBC) and platelet adhesion and thrombospondin and platelet factor 4 (PF4) release were noted for respective materials in the presence of injected bacteria. Materials that adhered significant quantities of injected S. epidermidis exhibited low levels of adsorbed proteins. Materials with high levels of preseeded S. epidermidis showed high levels of adsorbed proteins. Adhesion of preseeded bacteria and blood plasma elevations of C3a and FpA were lowest on semicrystalline polymer substrates, intermediate on halogenated substrates, and highest on amorphous substrates. In the presence of injected bacteria, WBCs and platelets adhered at earlier recirculation times to amorphous substrates than to semicrystalline substrates.",1
7611795,"BACKGROUND/DESIGN: The clonal theory of cancer predicts that transformed cells within a given tumor are derived from a single initiated precursor. Advancement of this precursor through various stages of tumor development occurs with the further accumulation of selective genetic and epigenetic lesions. Mammalian ras genes are important constituents of mitogenic signaling pathways, and when activated, they contribute to deregulated cellular growth. Activated ras genes play important roles in the development of certain skin tumors. Studies on a number of animal tumor model systems have shown that ras gene activation can be an early and perhaps initial event in the development of skin tumors. Activated ras genes are also found in a significant percentage of somatic human squamous cell carcinomas. To gain retrospective insight into the stages at which activated ras genes contribute to squamous cell carcinoma development, we investigated their incidence in actinic keratoses, premalignant precursors to squamous cell carcinomas. Using a nonradioactive polymerase chain reaction-based method developed in our laboratory, we examined a panel of 19 actinic keratoses and 33 squamous cell carcinomas for activated ras genes.",1
7607685,"The BAX gene is a member of the Bcl-2 gene family; it encodes a 21-kDa protein whose association with Bcl-2 is believed to play a critical role in regulating apoptosis. Through analysis of human-hamster somatic cell hybrid DNA and by in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes, we have determined that the human BAX gene is located in the q13.3-q13.4 region of human chromosome 19. We have also isolated a BAX cDNA clone in which that part of the mRNA encoded by exon 3 is absent. The skipping of exon 3 and the resultant splicing of exons 2 and 4 maintains the original reading frame and predicts the existence of an interstitially truncated form of the major Bax protein (Bax alpha), termed Bax delta. Unlike two previously described variant forms of Bax alpha (Bax beta and Bax tau), Bax delta retains the functionally critical C-terminal membrane anchor region as well as the Bcl-2 homology 1 and 2 (BH1 and BH2) domains.",1
7605581,"Evidence of RB1 allele loss was found in only 6% of pancreatic cancers, and we found no significant sequence abnormalities nor loss of RB protein expression in a panel of tumors and cell lines. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis, we found no evidence for loss of DCC expression in pancreatic cancer cell lines, and allele loss only rarely in tumor biopsies. These findings suggest that abnormalities of RB1 and DCC are unlikely to play a major role in pancreatic carcinogenesis.",1
7590742,"Papillary thyroid carcinomas have frequently been found to display oncogenic rearrangements of the NTRK1 gene, which encodes the high-affinity nerve growth factor receptor. Replacement of its extracellular domain by sequences coding for the 221 amino-terminal residues of the TPM3 gene was responsible for the oncogenic NTRK1 activation in three of eight of these tumors. In all of them, the illegitimate recombination involved the 611-bp NTRK1 intron placed upstream of the transmembrane domain and the TPM3 intron located between exons 7 and 8. Therefore, due to the splicing mechanism, all of the TPM3/NTRK1 gene fusions encoded an invariable transcript and the same chimeric protein of 70 kDa, which was constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine. In two of the three tumors the simultaneous presence of the reciprocal products of the TPM3/NTRK1 recombination, 5'TPM3-3'NTRK1 and 5'NTRK1-3'TPM3 sequences, respectively, and the previously demonstrated localization of both genes on the long arm of chromosome 1 lead us to suggest that an intrachromosomal inversion could be responsible for their recombination. In an attempt to understand the molecular basis that predisposes NTRK1 and TPM3 genes to be a recurrent target of illegitimate recombination, we have determined the nucleotide sequence around the breakpoints of the recombination products in all three patients as well as those of the corresponding regions from the normal TPM3 and NTRK1 genes. In these regions, a search for common features usually involved in illegitimate recombination in mammalian cells revealed the presence of some recombinogenic elements as well as pal-indromes, direct and inverted repeats, and Alu family sequences.",1
7579381,"B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is a heterogeneous lymphoid malignancy consisting of several histologic types. Alterations in proto-oncogenes caused by reciprocal chromosome translocations have been implicated in the etiology of specific histologic groups. In this study, we examined the contribution of the cell cycle inhibitor genes P15, P16, and P18 to pathogenesis in a large panel of 209 cytogenetically characterized B-cell NHL tumors representing varied histologic groups. We identified the homozygous deletion of P15 and P16 genes in 13 tumors from 12 patients, all belonging to diffuse large-cell histology; 10 had this diagnosis made on presentation, 1 had transformed from small lymphocytic lymphoma, and 1 had transformed from Hodgkin's disease. Tumor-specific point mutations were not identified in the coding regions of these genes. Cytogenetically, chromosome 9p was normal in all but one tumor. On the other hand, eight tumors hemizygous for 9p by cytogenetic analysis showed wild-type configuration of these genes. Our study, therefore, indicates that deletion of P15 and P16 occurs in about 15% of diffuse large-cell NHL and is not usually detected by cytogenetic analysis. P18 was wild-type in all tumors including the 13 tumors hemizygous for 1p.",1
7576105,"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) samples were screened for alterations in multiple tumor suppressor genes (p53 (17p13), p16INK4 (9p21), and disrupted in B-cell malignancy (DBM) (13q14) by using polymerase chain reaction-based assays. Eleven percent (11 of 96) of the B-CLL cases analyzed in this study and a previous study had mutations in the p53 gene. In contrast, analysis of the p16 gene showed none of 80 B-CLL cases had mutations and five cases (6%) had homozygous deletions. Deletions of 13q14 (DBM) occurred in 18% (17 of 96) of patients surveyed. Thus, 28 of 96 cases showed an alteration in one or more of the three tumor suppressor loci examined. However, cases with p53 mutations rarely showed simultaneous loss of DBM. Our results suggest that inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes p53 and DBM may be mutually exclusive, thus providing alternate pathways for tumor development in B-CLL patients.",1
7563186,"Two genes, p16 (also known as CDKN2, INK4A, or MTS1) and p15 (also described as INK4B or MTS2), are found in tandem at chromosome 9p21. These genes are designated as candidate tumor suppressor genes because they encode proteins that function as negative cell cycle regulators. (The encoded polypeptides inactivate specific cyclin-protein kinase complexes that are required for progression through the cell cycle.) Molecular genetic studies have revealed that deletion of the p16 and p15 genes occurs frequently in cancer cell lines and in certain malignant neoplasms.",1
7551394,"Young syndrome is characterized by obstructive azoospermia associated with chronic sinobronchial disease of an infectious nature, but normal sweat-gland and pancreatic function as well as normal nasal potential differences. Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) in some patients arises from mutations within the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene. Because of some similarities between Young syndrome, CF, and CBAVD, we evaluated 13 patients with Young syndrome, including screening for more than 30 different mutations within the CFTR gene. The mean age of the patients was 43 yr (range, 32 to 50 yr), and all were of northern European extraction. The sweat chloride concentration was normal in all patients (mean = 29 mEq/L; range, 8 to 43 mEq/L). Most had intermittent bronchial and sinus infections, but none was chronically colonized with Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The FEV1 was normal or only mildly reduced in most patients (mean = 74%; range, 48 to 100% predicted). Of 26 Young syndrome chromosomes, we identified one with the recognized CF mutation delta F508. The incidence of CFTR mutations (1 in 26) did not differ significantly from the expected carrier frequency in this population. In summary, it is unlikely that the typical Young syndrome patient has a clinical disease associated with CFTR mutation on both alleles.",1
7550229,"We characterized two novel mutations of the galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) gene in two Japanese patients with GALT deficiency and identified N314D and R333W mutations, previously found in Caucasians. One novel missense mutation was an G-to-A transition in exon 8, resulting in the substitution of arginine by histidine at the codon 231 (R231H). GALT activity of the R231H mutant construct was reduced to 15% of normal controls in a COS cell expression system. The other was a splicing mutation, an A-to-G transition at the 38th nucleotide in exon 3 (318A-->G), resulting in a 38-bp deletion in the GALT cDNA by activating a cryptic splice acceptor site. In seven Japanese families (14 alleles for classic form and one allele for Duarte variant) with GALT deficiency, the R231H and 318A-->G mutations were found only on both alleles of the proband. The N314D and R333W mutations were found on one allele each. The Q188R was prevalent in the United States but not in Japanese patients. The N314D mutation was associated with the Duarte variant in Japanese persons, as well as in the United States. We speculate that classic galactosemia mutations appear to differ between Japanese and Caucasian patients. Our limited data set on galactosemia mutations in Japanese suggests that the N314D GALT mutation encoding the Duarte variant arose before Asian and Caucasian people diverged and that classic galactosemia mutations arose and/or accumulated after the divergence of Asian and Caucasian populations.",1
7539744,"We demonstrate that the cytogenetically defined translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) found in human synovial sarcoma results in the fusion of the chromosome 18 SYT gene to either of two distinct genes, SSX1 or SSX2, at Xp11.2. The SSX1 and SSX2 genes encode closely related proteins (81% identity) of 188 amino acids that are rich in charged amino acids. The N-terminal portion of each SSX protein exhibits homology to the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB), a transcriptional repressor domain previously found only in Kruppel-type zinc finger proteins. PCR analysis demonstrates the presence of SYT-SSX1 or SYT-SSX2 fusion transcripts in 29 of 32 of the synovial sarcomas examined, indicating that the detection of these hybrid transcripts by PCR may represent a very useful diagnostic method. Sequence analysis has demonstrated heterogeneity in the fusion transcripts with the formation of two distinct SYT-SSX1 fusion junctions and two distinct SYT-SSX2 fusion junctions.",1
7485150,"Cells from persons with Bloom syndrome feature an elevated rate of sister-chromatid exchange (SCE). However, in some affected persons a minority of blood lymphocytes have a normal SCE rate. Persons who inherit the Bloom syndrome gene BLM identical by descent from a common ancestor very rarely exhibit this high-SCE/low-SCE mosaicism; conversely, mosaicism arises predominantly in persons who do not share a common ancestor. These population data suggested that most persons with Bloom syndrome in whom the exceptional low-SCE cells arise are not homozygous for a mutation at BLM but instead are compound heterozygotes. Following this clue, we carried out a genotype analysis of loci syntenic with BLM in 11 persons who exhibited mosaicism. In five of them, polymorphic loci distal to BLM that were heterozygous in their high-SCE cells had become homozygous in their low-SCE cells, whereas heterozygous loci proximal to BLM remained heterozygous. These observations are interpreted to mean that intragenic recombination between paternally derived and maternally derived mutated sites within BLM can generate a functionally wild-type gene and that low-SCE lymphocytes are progeny of a somatic cell in which such intragenic recombination had occurred.",1
7453827,"Insight into the control of gene expression may be gained by analysing genetic systems marked by both regulatory and structural variants. In such systems one can determine whether a regulatory element controls structural genes on both chromosomes or only on the chromosome to which it is linked. The latter may be detected in individuals heterozygous at both the regulatory and structural loci, in which case the effect of each regulatory allele is seen to be exerted only on the cis-located structural allele. In prokaryotic organisms, the identification of cis interaction of this sort has allowed elucidation of many features of genetic regulation, first for the lac operon and subsequently for a variety of other systems. In higher organisms, however, there have been few opportunities to observe cis-interacting genes. The most thoroughly characterized mammalian system in this regard is the murine beta-glucuronidase locus described by Paigen and his colleagues, in which cis interaction has been shown to occur between two closely linked genetic elements-the beta-glucuronidase structural gene itself and an androgen-activated regulatory gene which controls the quantity of beta-glucuronidase expressed. We report here that cis-interacting genetic elements are also found in the S region of the mouse major histocompatibility complex H-2.",0
7262559,"We present a method which permits comparison of the preferential use of degenerate codons within any gene. The method makes use of the triplet frequencies in the noncoding frames to assess whether a preference is specific to the reading frame. Preference is given a statistical meaning by use of the analysis of variance coupled to Duncan's multiple range test. Preferential use of degenerate codons is gene-specific and independent of gene size. The data suggest that any correlation between codon frequency distribution and tRNA levels is unreliable. In those animal genes examined, codons ending in C or G are preferred; in animal viruses tested, codons ending in U or A are preferred. Similarly, the bacterial genes and the genes of single-stranded DNA phages that we analyzed differed from each other as well as from eukaryotic genes in the third base of the codon.",0
7258228,"This communication brings the number of recognized cases of the C (trigonocephaly) syndrome to 11. The pattern of findings includes an anomaly of the anterior cranium and frontal cortex (trigonocephaly), the root of the nose (broad nasal bridge, epicanthus, and short nose), and palate (thick anterior alveolar ridges); abnormalities of the limbs (polysyndactyly, bridged palmar creases, short limbs, and joint dislocations and/or contractures); visceral defects (congenital heart defects, cryptorchidism, and abnormal lobulations of the lungs and kidneys). Auricular, mandibular, skin, and genital abnormalities also occur. Consistent neurological findings are hypotonia, strabismus, and psychomotor retardation; seizures have been reported. Normal chromosomes, normal parents with multiple affected offspring, equal sex ratio of affected individuals, and consanguineous matings all support autosomal recessive inheritance of the C syndrome. In autopsied cases, there has been a suggestion of defective central nervous system myelination. About 1/2 of the case have died within the first year. All survivors have severe to profound mental retardation except for one child who has moderate retardation.",1
7189689,"A 25-year-review of 1303 autopsies with metastatic non-reticuloendothelial and non-central nervous system malignancies revealed secondary cardiac neoplasms in 179 cases (14%). When the autopsies were divided into two groups by time period, a significant increased prevalence of secondary cardiac neoplasms was demonstrated during the later period (1966-1977). This noted increase was not influenced by chemotherapy but was apparently related to attempted curative surgical and/or radiation therapy.",0
7187365,"This note concerns theoretical and experimental studies of multifactorial traits, especially fitness and its components, in which (1) the loci studied are only a subset of those relevant to the character of interest and (2) the genotypes at the loci studied are in nonrandom association (linkage disequilibrium) with genotypes at the loci ignored. In these cases, phenotypic differences between cis and trans double heterozygotes can occur even though no linkage phase effects are inherent in the genetic determination of the trait. Examples are drawn from both theoretical and experimental work, and implications in both areas are discussed.",0
7182805,"An attempt is made to draw an analogy between contour drawing and a particular mathematical theorem. The analogy is seen to depend on the fact that both methods use definite values along a contour to imply a totality of values within the contour; thus, the use of a part to suggest the whole, by way of a hypothetical 'gestalt-like integration' in the case of the art contour, and the usual process of mathematical integration in the case of Cauchy's formula. Examples illustrating the analogy are drawn from a wide range of artistic work: a modern American drawing, a Cro-Magnon cave painting, and two Chinese works. The traditional Chinese philosophy of painting is invoked in support of the analogy because of its explicit emphasis on the primacy of outline drawing in Chinese painting. Some speculations are offered on further development and application of the analogy.",0
7119590,"This paper is concerned with gene survival in a population which may increase without density dependence according to a generalization of the Moran model for haploid individuals. A selective advantage to one allele and the possibility of differential reproductive rates are allowed. Simple conditions are given for ultimate homozygosity to be certain and for the possibility of ultimate polymorphism. The results complement and extend those of Heyde (1981, 1982).",0

In addition, psychometric data that relate to reliability and construct validity for the MARS-A scale are discussed. Two factors were identified in the scale, a factor of numerical anxiety that appeared in 91% of the items and a factor of mathematics test anxiety that appeared in the remaining items. Results that show the association between high mathematics anxiety scale scores and low grade average in mathematics courses are reported on two samples of students.",0
7104548,"Segregation analysis was applied to blind family data concerning schizophrenia to decide if the transmission of schizophrenia could be explained by a single major gene. Our results showed that the Mendelian model was unacceptable. Therefore, the monogenic hypothesis could not account for the transmission of schizophrenia. Since the hypothesis of no parent-child transmission was also not accepted, there was an indication that some form of vertical transmission existed which could be psychosocial, or an interaction between genetic and psychosocial factors. Our results suggest genetic heterogeneity in schizophrenia. Currently available clinical criteria for defining subgroups must be improved in conjunction with detection of biological indicators so that segregation analysis of family data could be effectively used in determining modes of transmission in schizophrenia.",1
6971307,"Leopard frogs (Rana pipiens Schreber) from Colorado were used in laboratory matings to investigate the mode of inheritance of green-brown, dorsal background color polymorphism. A total of 624 F1 progeny were produced in 18 successful matings. The results support the hypothesis that the control of dorsal color in Rana pipens is a two-allele, one-locus system with the allele for green color dominant to the allele for brown color.",0
6881911,"Kidd et al. (1980) studied the allelic origins of a recessive trait in an extensive and complex genealogy. Due to computational limitations, the hypotheses they could consider were limited, and the dependencies in descent from alternative ancestors and to different sibships were not considered. Karigl (1981) developed a recursive algorithm for the computation of multiple kinship coefficients. Here we show that very similar algorithms apply to probabilities of the joint descent of multiple genes from specified ancestral genes. This makes possible a far more extensive analysis of hypotheses of allelic origins in a genealogy.",0
6821505,"Three threonine-overproducing mutants were obtained as prototrophic revertants of a hom3 mutant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The gene HOM3 codes for aspartokinase (aspartate kinase; EC 2.7.2.4), the first enzyme of the threonine-methionine biosynthetic route, which is subjected to feedback inhibition by threonine. Enzymatic studies indicated that aspartokinase from the revertants has lost the feedback inhibition, resulting in overproduction of threonine. These revertants also bore one or two additional mutations, named tex1-1 and tex2-1, which alone or jointly made possible the excretion of the threonine accumulated. The effect of these two genes on excretion is potentiated by excess inositol in the medium.",0
6650499,"A re-analysis of familial transmission of congenital glaucoma is performed here using the unified model and considering, respectively, joint and conditional likelihoods. Whereas the familial aggregation of this malformation is consistent with the segregation of a recessive major gene and a high proportion of sporadic cases using conditional likelihood, this is rejected using joint likelihood. The difference in the results obtained using each of these two strategies is discussed.",0
6599973,"The members of the rabbit and human beta-like globin gene families have been compared both by a computer-generated dot matrix graphical analysis of each entire gene and by calculating divergences in the coding regions. The rabbit-human gene pairs beta 4-epsilon, beta 3-gamma, psi beta 2-delta, and beta 1-beta were identified as orthologous on the basis of sequence similarities found in flanking and intervening sequences as well as by quantitative divergence calculations. The orthologous genes are in the same order on the chromosome in each species, which suggests that an ancestral family with the arrangement 5'-epsilon-gamma-delta-beta-3' preceded the mammalian radiation. Descendants of ancestral epsilon have diverged more slowly than other beta-like genes and are expressed only in embryonic life. Descendants of ancestral gamma and beta diverged at a higher rate and are expressed at wider range of developmental times. Descendants of delta have undergone nonreciprocal recombination at a high frequency and are often pseudogenes. Paralogous comparisons among the rabbit beta-like globin genes show that the beta 4-beta 3 and psi beta 2-beta 1 pairs are most similar and that beta 4 and beta 3 are more closely related to beta 1 than to psi beta 2. This fits with a branching pattern where the primordial beta split into ancestral epsilon/gamma and delta/beta genes, which later split into epsilon and gamma or delta and beta, respectively. Rabbit genes beta 4 and beta 1 acquired similar 3' untranslated regions after the epsilon/gamma split but prior to the mammalian radiation, presumably via a gene conversion event. The 5' end of beta 2 apparently converted with beta 1 after the radiation, and afterward it became a pseudogene.",0
6393058,"We describe a new statistical method for measuring bias in the codon usage table of a gene. The test is based on the multinomial and Poisson distributions. The method is used to scan DNA sequences and measure the strength of codon preference. For E. Coli we show that the strength of codon preference is related to levels of gene expression. The method can also be used to compare base triplet frequencies with those expected from the base composition. This second type of codon bias test is useful for distinguishing coding from non-coding regions.",0
6346263,"The ilvB gene of Escherichia coli K12 has been cloned into a multicopy plasmid. The regulation of the cloned gene by valine or leucine limitation and by catabolite repression is the same as for the chromosome encoded gene. The nucleotide sequence of a regulatory region preceding the ilvB structural gene has been determined. This DNA sequence includes a promoter, a region which codes for a putative 32 amino acid polypeptide containing multiple valine and leucine codons, and a transcription termination site. In vitro transcription of this region produces a 184 nucleotide terminated leader transcript. Mutually exclusive secondary structures of the leader transcript are predicted. On the basis of these data, a model for multivalent attenuation of the ilvB operon is presented. Data are presented which suggests that at least part of the postulated CRP-cyclic AMP binding site of the ilvB operon precedes the transcription start site by more than 71 base pairs.",0
6337396,"Human insulin produced by recombinant DNA technology is the first commercial health care product derived from this technology. Work on this product was initiated before there were federal guidelines for large-scale recombinant DNA work or commercial development of recombinant DNA products. The steps taken to facilitate acceptance of large-scale work and proof of the identity and safety of such a product are described. While basic studies in recombinant DNA technology will continue to have a profound impact on research in the life sciences, commercial applications may well be controlled by economic conditions and the availability of investment capital.",0
6308816,"The effects of gliclazide on blood sugar levels and the micro-vascular system have been specified by the latest international studies of this antidiabetic agent presented at the 11th World Congress on Diabetes Mellitus. The potency of gliclazide is similar to that of the most effective reference agents. However, the mode of action of gliclazide, which induces an insulin release resembling physiologic conditions, explains why hypoglycemia is uncommon. Pharmacokinetic studies in the elderly have shown that gliclazide can be given to these more susceptible patients. Lastly, a number of trials, each of which was carried out against reference agents, have shown that gliclazide is valuable in delaying the course of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.",1
6182157,"The present state of knowledge strongly supports the view that development and differentiation is a function of variable gene activity. The crucial area of ignorance, however, is the mechanism that controls gene expression. The recent development of powerful experimental techniques in molecular biology, commonly referred to as recombinant DNA technology, now permits investigations toward understanding the mechanism(s) operant in regulation of gene activity. The technique basically involves the use of several recently discovered enzymes that facilitate cutting and joining DNA to construct recombinant molecules, which can be transferred from one organism to another. The information thus obtained on structure, organization, and expression of genes would help unravel the mysteries of mechanisms involved in fundamental life processes.",0
6139815,"With the increasing emphasis on data analysis in mathematical genetics, problems of parametrizing genealogical structure become of practical importance. A complete specification of the genetic effects of genealogical structure is provided by the probabilities of genetically distinct states of gene identity by descent. Although this provides a direct parametrization for the joint distribution of traits on a set of related individuals, it is an unwieldy tool in the analysis of large and complex genealogies. Probabilities of joint descent of founder genes and likely ancestries of alleles provide alternative characterizations of relationship and have direct application in practical problems. Joint extinction probabilities of founder genes can also be derived as ancestral likelihoods: evolutionarily, the most significant characteristic of a genealogical structure must be its effect on the survival and extinction of genes.",0
6105440,"A study of patients with vitiligo shows that the pattern of depigmentation is genetically determined. The mutant gene, however, is unstable in that it often does not breed true even in identical twins or on the two sides of the body in an individual. The patchiness of vitiligo is probably due to activation of the mutant gene in discrete clones of cells which govern melanocyte behaviour at the sites of pigment loss. The frequent occurrence of different organ-specific autoimmune diseases in various members of a single family could also be attributable to unstable mutations in a set of genes which control endocrine and gastric epithelial cells; activation of the mutant gene in particular cell clones may account for the focal tissue damage often associated with, but not readily explained by, organ specific autoimmunity. Unstable mutation causing cell proliferation seems to affect the same set of genes in families with the multiple endocrine adenoma-peptic ulcer syndrome, the occurrence of focal (adenoma) or diffuse dyperplasia depending on the size of the cell clones in which the mutant genes have been activated. The tendency of these genes to display unstable mutations which subsequently undergo further mutation is reminiscent of the behavior of certain linked genes in special chromatosomal regions in plants, insects, and mice and may provide clues to the association of histocompatibility antigens with certain diseases in man.",1
4881984,"In the 5 years since the Vioxx debacle, efforts have been made to enhance drug safety. These include the introduction of legislation that expands the power of drug regulatory agencies, new data transparency standards and increased requirements for funding of post-marketing drug surveillance. Nevertheless, some doubt remains that these changes will be sufficient to address the increasing challenges in the field of drug safety. Here, from the perspective of a drug researcher, I discuss key areas for further development that could deliver long-term solutions to these challenges: enhanced tools for the detection of safety signals, innovative phased drug launches, new risk stratification techniques and improved pharmacovigilance operations.",0
4818263,"When directional selection for an additively inherited trait is opposed by natural selection favoring heterozygous genotypes a selection plateau may be reached where genetic variance is present. The amount of response when this plateau is reached is a simple function of the selection response in the first generation and the intensity of natural selection. When selection is practiced in small populations, the sizes of the initial equilibrium gene frequencies are at least as important as the intensity of natural selection in determining the probability of fixing desirable alleles.",0
4623520,"Selection of Gl-Sb coupling heterozygotes was carried out for more than one hundred generations commencing with six independent lines drawn from a common base population. Population sizes were eight, sixteen and forty-eight parents per generation. The effect of natural selection on recombination value was measured by sampling and testing females at varying intervals of time. There was a significant reduction in percentage recombination between Gl and Sb from fifteen to a level between five and ten in four out of six of the original lines. In most cases this reduction occurred rather rapidly after the initiation of the experiment. In the remaining two lines there was no significant decrease in recombination value; there was, however, a significant increase in at least one subline of this group. The rapid rate of change of recombination value is most readily explained by the presence of a recombination modifying gene which is linked to the modified region. Genetic random drift was again shown to have an important effect on changes in recombination value in small populations. High recombination was almost completely recessive to low recombination in the one case examined. Lethal genes were fixed in sheltered regions of unmarked third chromosomes in five lines or sublines. These results are discussed in relation to the mode of development of permanent heterozygosity in some species of plants.",0
4054594,"In unrelated individuals, their phenotypes at two gene loci may appear correlated. The two major reasons for such a deviation from independence are linkage disequilibrium (allelic association) and an interaction between the phenotypes.

The test is demonstrated with an example.",0

3896744,"Deficiencies of specific vitamins produce consistent symptoms of psychiatric disorder. Thiamine deficiency, which is common in alcoholism, can produce confusion and psychotic symptoms, in addition to neurological signs. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency may contribute symptoms of disorientation, depression or psychosis; their measurement is a part of routine dementia work-ups. Pyridoxine deficiency results in seizures, although the effects of exogenously administered pyridoxine are not clearly understood in depression and anxiety - the disorders in which it is most frequently used clinically. The use of vitamins has been most prominent in psychiatry in the treatment of schizophrenia, where large doses of nicotinic acid were initially given alone and later combined with other vitamins and minerals. Several theoretical models were described to support the use of vitamins in schizophrenia. These included: the parallels of schizophrenia to the psychiatric symptoms of pellagra; hypotheses of a defect in adrenaline metabolism; and the accumulation of psychotoxic substances which produce psychotic symptoms. Initially, positive results were reported over 30 years ago, but have not been replicated by thorough investigations. An extensive series of comprehensive placebo-controlled trials failed to show efficacy for any of the vitamin therapies tested. Although clearly less effective than antipsychotic drug treatment, vitamin therapy is not without risks - adverse effects have been reported with nicotinic acid, pyridoxine and vitamin C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1
3862932,"By applying the Southern blot technique we compared the structural gene rpsA for ribosomal protein S1 and its preceding sequence from Escherichia coli with nine other bacterial species. We found high homology among the structural genes of E. coli and other gram-negative but not gram-positive bacteria. In contrast, the regulatory sequence preceding the structural gene was not highly conserved among the organisms studied. Cloning and DNA sequence analysis of a 1.2 kb fragment coding for most of the structural gene for S1 from Providencia localized some strongly conserved parts of the DNA sequence, despite the fact that the codon usage showed considerable divergence from that of E. coli.",0
3804765,"Suppose that selection acts at one or more loci to maintain genetic differences between hybridising populations. Then, the flow of alleles at a neutral marker locus which is linked to these selected loci will be impeded. We define and calculate measures of the barrier to gene flow between two distinct demes, and across a continuous habitat. In both cases, we find that in order for gene flow to be significantly reduced over much of the genome, hybrids must be substantially less fit, and the number of genes involved in building the barrier must be so large that the majority of other genes become closely linked to some locus which is under selection. This conclusion is not greatly affected by the pattern of epistasis, or the position of the marker locus along the chromosome.",0

3756718,"The traditional clinical method, which has served medicine well for over 100 years, had its origins in the integration of physical examination with morbid anatomy in early 19th-century France. Now this method is showing signs of failing to meet some contemporary needs. In particular, there is no means for understanding the inner experience of patients. Previous models of a transformed method have not grappled with the problem of validation. Data on the inner experience of patients are not open to empiric validation in the same way as clinical data. The process of understanding the meaning of an illness is not, therefore, scientific in the conventional sense. There are, none the less, rigorous methods for validating the results of this form of inquiry, notably those of phenomenology. A transformed method should aim to understand the meaning of an illness for the patient as well as provide a clinical diagnosis. The transformation will require a change in the epistemology of medicine and an educational process that encourages reflection and growth of self-knowledge.",0
3718511,"CgA is a 72Kd protein of unknown function that is present in many neuroendocrine tissues and co-secreted with their resident hormones. We prepared a cDNA library to the mRNA from CgA-producing human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) cells in the expression vector lambda gt11. The library was screened with a panel of one polyclonal and two monoclonal antibodies to CgA. The specificity of the antibodies for CgA was demonstrated by immunoassay, immunohistology, and immunoprecipitation of the in vitro translation products of mRNA from CgA-producing tissues. A chromogenic second antibody identified five immunoreactive clones. Their cDNA inserts were isolated after EcoRI digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. These cDNAs were 32P-labelled and used as probes in Northern hybridization studies. An mRNA of approximately 2.3Kb was detected with the cDNA probes in human cell lines from MTC and lung cancers that were shown to produce CgA and in human pheochromocytoma and bovine adrenal medulla tissue. To confirm its identity, one of the putative CgA cDNAs was subcloned into a plasmid and was used to hybridization-arrest the in vitro translation of CgA mRNA. These studies demonstrate the cloning of cDNAs which hybridize with CgA mRNA from diverse neuroendocrine tissues.",1
3680924,"The genetic control of four developmental characters was studied in Amaranthus caudatus L. Determinant panicle growth was determined by one recessive gene. Two major genes governed panicle orientation, with erect panicles incompletely dominant to drooping panicles. Additional modifier genes appeared to alter expression of panicle orientation. A single recessive gene determined dwarfism. Pleiotropy or tight linkage was responsible for abnormal growth of dwarf plants. Pink embryo color was under the control of two complementary epistatic genes with one locus determining the presence or absence of red betalain pigment and the other locus regulating the expression of pigment in developing embryos.",1
3661563,"The widespread use of genetic screening, along with mating and reproductive patterns reflecting that information, can significantly alter the genetic structure of populations. Both allele frequencies and mortality could be significantly reduced if carriers of lethal recessive alleles were withdrawn from the mating pool. But schemes to mask deleterious alleles in heterozygous condition could significantly increase the deleterious-allele frequencies while resulting in only a slight reduction in mortality. The immediate and equilibrium consequences of such mating strategies may be quite disparate.",0

3561489,"Regulation of transcription in eukaryotes is mediated by the specific interaction between cellular factors and promoter sequences. Cis-acting DNA sequences, frequently located upstream of the TATA box, have been implicated in modulating the expression of many genes. We are interested in the transcriptional regulation of proto-oncogenes because they may have a pivotal function in cell growth and differentiation. Expression of the proto-oncogene c-fos is induced in response to a variety of growth factors and differentiation-specific agents. The viral cognate of the c-fos gene is the resident transforming gene of FBJ-murine osteosarcoma virus which causes bone tumours in vivo and cellular transformation in vitro. We report here that transcription of the human c-fos gene is modulated by negatively and positively acting cellular factors.",1

This factor also binds to a similar sequence lying in the opposite orientation in the promoter of the mouse beta 2-microglobulin gene, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism. Transfection competition experiments indicate that this factor acts as a positive element in the expression of H-2 and beta 2-microglobulin genes.",1
3547335,"A simple, effective measure of synonymous codon usage bias, the Codon Adaptation Index, is detailed. The index uses a reference set of highly expressed genes from a species to assess the relative merits of each codon, and a score for a gene is calculated from the frequency of use of all codons in that gene. The index assesses the extent to which selection has been effective in moulding the pattern of codon usage. In that respect it is useful for predicting the level of expression of a gene, for assessing the adaptation of viral genes to their hosts, and for making comparisons of codon usage in different organisms. The index may also give an approximate indication of the likely success of heterologous gene expression.",0
3547333,"The transin gene is induced by oncogenes and epidermal growth factor (EGF). We report here the isolation of a related gene (transin-2 gene). The structures of these genes are very similar. Indeed, a stretch of 428 nucleotides of the transin gene containing both exon and intron sequences is 98% conserved in the transin-2 gene. However, the putative promoter regions of the genes show little sequence homology, apart from a short element related to a sequence involved in control of transcription by cyclic AMP or a tumour promoter. Expression of the transin-2 gene, unlike that of the transin gene, is not induced by EGF, dibutyryl cyclic AMP or cytochalasin D. Nevertheless, transin-2 RNA is expressed in several transformed rat embryo fibroblast cell lines, and can be induced by a tumour promoter. The proteins transin and transin-2 are approximately 71% homologous in sequence. Both proteins show significant sequence homology with two connective tissue degrading metalloproteases. These homologies raise the possibility that expression of transin and transin-2 in transformed cells might play a role in tumour invasion.",1

3476935,"Rat mitochondrial ornithine carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.3) is encoded by a gene located on the X chromosome and expressed specifically in the liver and small intestine; we have cloned this gene and determined its structure. The gene is 75 kilobases long and is split into 10 exons. The introns range in length from 85 bases to 26 kilobases. The sum of the total exons is 1.5 kilobases and occupies only 2% of the gene; this value being one of the lowest among genes heretofore reported. The first exon encodes most of the NH2-terminal presequence that functions as a mitochondrial targeting signal. Putative binding sites for the two substrates of the enzyme, carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine, are encoded by exons 3 and 9, respectively. A set of ""CAAT box""- and ""ATA box""-like sequences is present about 200 bases upstream from the 5' end of the mRNA. About 35 bases downstream from this set of putative promoter elements, an 11-nucleotide sequence around the 5' end of the mRNA reappears, as a direct repeat. This pair of direct repeats may play a role in pulling the cap site and the promoter elements together. Upstream and downstream from the 5' end of the mRNA there are several sequences that resemble the transcription factor Sp1 binding site, the enhancer core sequence, the consensus sequence for the glucocorticoid receptor binding sites, and the putative enhancer element of the antithrombin III gene, another gene that is expressed specifically in the liver.",1
3475224,"In recent years molecular biologists have learnt to mimic and exploit the natural processes of cell biology which are based on the fundamental principle that the amino acid sequence of a protein is encoded within the nucleotide sequence of DNA in its gene. The resultant set of novel methodologies, termed recombinant DNA technology, or genetic engineering, has revolutionized the study of almost all branches of biology and has presented radical new methods of producing proteins otherwise available only in very small quantities. Central technical features of the recombinant DNA technology are the ability to isolate and propagate individual genes from natural sources, and to express into the protein products the information intrinsic to such genes, using the most appropriate biological production systems (e.g. bacteria, yeast or cultured mammalian cells). Embracing powerful analytical techniques such as DNA sequencing, and novel gene manipulations based on chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, the recombinant DNA technology is now having substantial impact on analytical and preparative protein technologies. The contemporary integrated approach to protein engineering involves not only protein chemistry and tools such as antibodies, but also has a dynamic interactive contribution from the recombinant DNA technology and its gene manipulation and expression skills. This integrated approach is particularly relevant to blood components such as clotting factors, antibodies, hormones and other proteins or peptides of powerful biological activity and specificity. Current work is focussed on the large-scale production of individual proteins as well as the molecular dissection of their biological actions and the development of products displaying novel biological activity.",0
3474618,"We have isolated several cDNA clones from a lambda gt11 expression library by screening with antibodies prepared against the microsomal enzyme steroid sulfatase, which is deficient in classical X-chromosome-linked ichthyosis patients. One of these clones (p422) has been assigned by mapping with a somatic cell hybrid panel and by in situ hybridization to Xp22.3. Clone p422 therefore has a coincident localization with the previously identified locus for steroid sulfatase expression in the region of the X chromosome escaping from inactivation. Twelve steroid sulfatase-deficient patients, including eight cases of classical ichthyosis, were found to be deleted for genomic sequences detected by the clone.",1
3446956,"A study, by means of computer simulation, has been performed on the evolution of recombination rate modifier genes in a system with three diallelic loci (A, B and C). The locus C, selectively neutral, is responsible for the modification of the recombination fraction between the major loci (A and B) which are subjected to selection. Two models have been analysed, the modifier allele being recessive in one of them, and codominant in the other, with infinite and finite populations. Distinct initial genic frequencies of the major loci and different selection coefficients have been utilised. We have found that the frequency of the allele which favours recombination increases in finite populations, and decreases slightly in infinite populations. These results are consistent with previous theory; presumably, selection favours alleles reducing recombination between epistatically interacting loci in a infinite population, since this reduces the breakup of advantageous combinations of alleles. However, in finite populations, selection favours the breakup of the random linkage disequilibria which are produced by random drift.",0
3446013,"A method of subdividing genetic data into self-contained subsets has been described in terms of examples. The subsets are such that each of them permits a valid estimate of the parameter concerned. Hence, the discarding of one or more subsets would not affect the validity of the remaining data. The detailed statistical properties of such subsets await further investigation. There is a need to simplify the variance formulas for estimates based on partial data.",0
3432265,"We have analyzed the regulation of expression of the human beta-globin gene by DNA mediated gene transfer in MEL cells and microinjection in fertilized mouse eggs.

3428575,"Fixation indices summarize the associations between genes that arise from the joint effects of inbreeding and selection. In this paper, fixation indices are derived for pairs, triplets and quadruplets of genes at a single multiallelic locus. The fixation indices are obtained by dividing cumulants by constants; the cumulants describe the statistical distribution of alleles and the constants are functions of gene frequency. The use of cumulants instead of moments is necessary only for four-gene indices, when the fourth cumulant is used. A second type of four-gene index is also required, and this index is based upon the covariation of second-order cumulants. At multiallelic loci, a large number of indices is possible. If alleles are selectively neutral, the number of indices is reduced and the relationship between gene identity and gene cumulants is shown.--Two-gene indices can always be estimated from genotypic frequency data at a single polymorphic locus. Three-gene indices are also estimable except when allele frequency equals one-half. Four-gene indices are not estimable unless selection is assumed to have an equal effect upon each allele (such as under selective neutrality) and the locus contains at least three alleles of unequal frequency. For diallelic or selected loci, an alternative four-gene fixation index is proposed. This index incorporates both types of four-gene associations but cannot be related to gene identity.",0
3409926,"An EEG study has been carried out on 19 children (including siblings in 3 families) with clinical features of Angelman syndrome. The age at time of the first EEG ranged from 11 months to 11 years with the majority under 5 years. Six children had no history of seizures at the time of the first EEG. One or more of the following EEG abnormalities were seen in all patients: 1. Persistent rhythmic 4-6/s activities reaching more than 200 microV not associated with drowsiness. 2. Prolonged runs of rhythmic 2-3/s activity (200-500 microV) often more prominent anteriorly, sometimes associated with discharges (ill-defined spike/wave complexes). 3. Spikes mixed with 3-4/s components usually more than 200 microV mainly posteriorly and facilitated by, or only seen with, eye closure. Two and sometimes three of these EEG features could be present in the same record particularly at a young age. The appearance of discharges mixed with slow components on eye closure was the commonest finding seen at some stage in 17 patients (aged from 11 months to over 12 years). The EEG features of Angelman syndrome appear to be sufficiently characteristic to help identify patients at an early age before the clinical features become obvious and at a time when genetic counselling may be particularly important.",0
3403959,"Blood ring describes a lethal embryonic condition in chickens that is expressed between 48 and 66 h of incubation. The condition is characterized by the presence of uncoalesced blood islands, the absence of vitelline arteries, and a sinus terminalis engorged with erythrocytes. The disorder is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The recessive gene has been detected in three commercial populations of chickens with estimated gene frequencies ranging from 0.08 to 0.16. Attempts to identify the mechanism for the blood ring gene's expression have so far been unsuccessful. The gene symbol blr is proposed for the recessive gene.",0
3327538,"Vitamins are organic compounds essential in small amounts for metabolic functions. Since they cannot be synthesized in the body they must be supplied with the diet. While fat-soluble vitamins cross the placenta by single and/or facilitated diffusion the water-soluble vitamins are actively transported with the exception of vitamin C. An adequate supply of fat-soluble vitamins to the fetus seems to be dependent on maternal blood levels during gestation. On the contrary, the transfer of water-soluble vitamins is relatively independent of the levels in maternal blood. Due to their immaturity preterm and low birth weight infants require higher dosages of some vitamins compared to healthy full-term newborns.",0
3306735,"A pair of yeast strains of opposite mating type was constructed to contain polymorphisms at three loci on the mitochondrial genome--the 21 S rRNA gene, var1, and cob--such that parental and recombinant forms of these genes could be easily detected by Southern blot analysis. These polymorphisms were used to measure in a single cross gene conversions at the 21 S rRNA and var1 loci and a reciprocal recombination at cob. For all three loci, recombination initiates at about the same time, 4 to 6 h after mixing cells, and increases with similar kinetics over a 24-h period. The segregation of parental and recombinant forms of these genes was then followed by pedigree analysis. The results, which show a high variance in the distribution of parental and recombinant forms of all three genes in cells derived from both the first bud and the mother zygote, are consistent with the segregation of a small number of mitochondrial DNA molecules from the zygote to diploid buds. Based on these results and previous experiments of this type, a limited ""zone of mixing"" of parental mitochondrial DNA molecules probably exists in the zygote. The extent of sampling from this zone, together with the intrinsic properties of the recombination events themselves, is likely to determine the observed pattern of recombination of mitochondrial DNA sequences at the population level.",0
3296191,"Molecular genetics approaches have been used to identify and characterize cis-acting DNA sequences required for eukaryotic gene regulation. These sequences are modular in nature, consisting of arrays of short (10- to 12-base pair) recognition elements that interact with specific transcription factors. Some transcription factors have been extensively purified and the corresponding genes have been cloned, but the mechanisms by which they promote transcription are not yet understood. Positive and negative regulatory elements that function only in specific cell types or in response to extracellular inducers have been identified. A number of cases of inducible and tissue-specific gene expression involve the activation of preexisting transcription factors, rather than the synthesis of new proteins. This activation may involve covalent modification of the protein or an allosteric change in its structure. The modification of regulatory proteins may play a central role in the mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation.",0
3257719,"Two approaches--molecular cloning and immunochemical analysis--have identified one of the components of Alzheimer's disease amyloid deposits as the serine protease inhibitor alpha 1-antichymotrypsin. An antiserum against isolated Alzheimer amyloid deposits detected immunoreactivity in normal liver. The antiserum was then used to screen a liver cDNA expression library, yielding three related clones. DNA sequence analysis showed that these clones code for alpha 1-antichymotrypsin. Antisera against purified alpha 1-antichymotrypsin stained Alzheimer amyloid deposits, both in situ and after detergent extraction from brain. The anti-amyloid antiserum recognizes at least two distinct epitopes in alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, further supporting the presence of this protein in Alzheimer amyloid deposits. In addition to being produced in the liver and released into the serum, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin is expressed in Alzheimer brain, particularly in areas that develop amyloid lesions. Models by which alpha 1-antichymotrypsin could contribute to the development of Alzheimer amyloid deposits are discussed.",1
3189332,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in an accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, and other organs. The WD locus (WND) has previously been linked to esterase D (ESD) and localized to 13q14-22. With the large Centre d'Etude Polymorphisme Humain cohort, a refined map of DNA markers from this region was constructed, with the following locus order: D13S1-D13S21-D13S22-D13S10-ESD-RB-WND-D 13S26-D13S12-D13S2. A significant excess of male recombination was observed between D13S21 and D13S22. Intervals distal to D13S22 showed an excess of female recombination. When these markers were tested on 19 WD families from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, the two closest loci were shown to be RB and D13S26. The retinoblastoma gene locus (RB) was shown to be proximal to WND at a distance of 4.4 centimorgans (cM), and D13S26 was placed distal to WND at a distance of 4.0 cM. ESD was assigned proximally at a distance of 9.4 cM. In all families studied WND was linked to one or more of the loci ESD, RB, or D13S26.",1
3128715,"This investigation of the codon context of enterobacteria, plasmid, and phage protein genes was based on a search for correlations between the presence of one base type at codon position III and the presence of another base type at some other position in adjacent codons. Enterobacterial genes were compared with eukaryotic sequences for codon context effects. In enterobacterial genes, base usage at codon position III is correlated with the third position of the upstream adjacent codon and with all three positions of the downstream codon. Plasmid genes are free of context biases. Phage genes are heterogeneous: MS2 codons have no biased context, whereas lambda genes partly follow the trends of the host bacterium, and T7 genes have biased codon contexts that differ from those of the host. It has been reported that two successive third-codon positions tend to be occupied by two purines or two pyrimidines in Escherichia coli genes of low expression level. Here, the extent to which highly expressed protein genes can modulate base usage at two successive codon positions III, given the constraints on codon usage and protein sequence that act on them, was quantified. This demonstrates that the above-mentioned favored patterns are not a characteristic of weakly expressed genes but occur in all genes in which codon context can vary appreciably. The correlation between successive third-codon positions is a distinct feature of enterobacteria and of some phages, one that may result from adaptation of gene structure to translational efficiency. Conversely, codon context in yeast and human genes is biased--but for reasons unrelated to translation.",0
3124533,"The comparative lack of sexual dimorphism of apricot and other [sex-linked] genes studied is due to ""sex-limitation"", i.e., to a compensatory influence of the dosage difference between the sexes in respect to other genes in the X-chromosome. The facts are of particular interest from an evolutionary standpoint.",0
3040015,"Using Sanger's technique and synthetic oligonucleotides derived from the known structure of cDNA, complete nucleotide sequence of the genomic copy of the mouse TNF-alpha gene has been determined. The length of the gene from transcription initiation site down to polyadenylation signal is about 2620 bp. Comparison with the previously described cDNA sequence revealed existence of 4 exons and 3 introns in the positions homologous to those of human TNF gene. The fourth exon codes for 88% amino acids of mature TNF-alpha.",1
3037330,"A sequence element within pBR322 DNA mediates a cis-acting negative effect on expression from eucaryotic genes in transient expression assays.

3036829,"The DP region of the human major histocompatibility complex contains two alpha genes and two beta genes. The DP alpha 1 and beta 1 genes encode the expressed DP histocompatibility antigen molecule, while the DP alpha 2 and beta 2 genes are inactive in the haplotypes examined. Here we present the sequence of the two DP beta genes and of the expressed DP alpha 1 gene. Nucleotide sequence comparisons reveal a considerably greater degree of similarity between the two beta genes than between the two alpha genes. We propose that a duplication giving rise to the DP alpha gene pair evolutionarily preceded the corresponding DP beta gene duplication. We also propose, based on the orientation of other class II gene pairs, that the original DP molecule was encoded by the DP beta 1 and DP alpha 2 genes. At some stage during the evolution of the DP region both of the two pseudogenes appear to have been expressed.",1
3023851,"The SIR genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are responsible for the position-dependent regulation of the a and alpha mating-type genes. Previous work by others has shown that the products of the SIR genes prevent the accumulation of stable transcripts of the a and alpha genes at HML and HMR. Results of this study establish that this regulation is a region-specific effect rather than a gene-specific effect since expression of a tRNA gene placed at HMR is repressed by the products of the SIR genes.",0
3023199,"The enhancer and promoter of the immediate early gene of human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) were tested as a transcriptional control element by fusion to the cat gene, followed by measurement of its expression from plasmid DNA in the extrachromosomal and integrated state, respectively. Comparison of the hCMV enhancer-promoter to two other viral elements was performed in six commonly used cell lines of different tissue and species origin. Irrespective of the cell line and of the state of the DNA, the hCMV enhancer-promoter was considerably stronger than both the SV40 promoter and the long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus.",1
3022382,"Patients with Werner's syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder, undergo an accelerated aging process that leads to premature death. Fibroblasts from such patients typically grow poorly in culture. Here it is shown that fibroblasts from a patient with Werner's syndrome have a markedly attenuated mitogenic response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). In contrast, they have a full mitogenic response to fetal bovine serum. Both PDGF binding and receptor numbers per cell are unaltered. The Werner's syndrome cells express high constitutive levels of collagenase in vitro. Although PDGF enhances collagenase expression through increased levels of hybridizable collagenase messenger RNA in normal skin fibroblasts, no induction of collagenase occurs in the Werner's syndrome fibroblasts. Moreover, the failure to respond to this agonist effect of PDGF is not restored by fetal bovine serum. The data suggest that failure of one or more PDGF-mediated pathways in Werner's syndrome cells may contribute to the phenotypic expression of the disorder.",1
3019838,"The mom gene of bacteriophage Mu encodes a DNA modification function. The gene is regulated on the transcriptional level by Dam-specific methylation and a trans-acting Mu function, and on a post-transcriptional level by the product of gene com. The gene encoding the transactivator has been cloned and mapped. By complementation analysis the activation function (also designated Dad) was shown to be the product of gene C. Transactivation of the mom promoter was shown in the following assay: the mom promoter and N-terminal part of com were fused in frame to lacZ. Cells containing such fusion plasmids were infected with M13 clones expressing C in the presence of IPTG and XGal. Successful transactivation results in the formation of blue plaques. Moreover, we have determined the sequence of gene C and found that it has a coding capacity of 140 amino acids. The promoter for C (pc) is likely to be located at least 0.5 kb upstream from the gene. A transcription terminator is found directly downstream from the C-coding region.",0
3013611,"Previous studies have revealed the occurrence of two closely linked conserved sequence elements, designated as HOMOL 1 and RPG box, in front of most yeast ribosomal protein genes examined. To investigate whether these conserved nucleotide elements play a role in the regulation of ribosomal protein gene expression, we performed deletion analysis of the DNA region upstream of the gene encoding ribosomal protein L25. To that end we constructed a hybrid gene consisting of the pertinent 5'-flanking sequence and the Escherichia coli galK marker gene. The effects on the transcription of this fusion gene of Bal31-generated deletions were measured by Northern analysis of RNA isolated from the respective transformed yeast cells. The results demonstrate that removal of one box has a detrimental effect on the level of transcription, whereas after the deletion of both boxes hardly any transcription can be observed. Subsequently we inserted synthetic oligonucleotides in the upstream region of an L25 gene from which the original boxes had been removed. Expression of the inactivated hybrid gene turned out to be restored even by insertion of one RPG element. Moreover, the RPG box functions in both orientations, though not with equal efficiency.",1
2995895,"A constant fine regulation of gene expression is needed for the normal development to proceed and for the physiological homeostasis to be maintained. In many cases such a regulation in eukaryotes is realized at the level of transcription, involving various cis- and trans-regulatory genomic elements. The review provides the data on the structure of elements determining the level of gene transcription in response to the action of various environmental factors and effectors, responsible for coordinated expression of the genes which provide for tissue-specific transcription and self-regulation of gene transcription. The data were considered on regulation of gene activity by mobile genetic elements and a relationship between the mechanisms of regulation of gene expression and evolution has been formulated.",0
2989692,"Human chronic myelogenous leukaemia is characterized by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 resulting in an abbreviated form of chromosome 22 and the transfer of the abl cellular oncogene from chromosome 9 into the bcr gene of chromosome 22. Characterization of an 8-kilobase RNA specific to chronic myelogenous leukaemia shows it to be a fused transcript of the two genes. The fused protein that would be produced is probably involved in the malignant process.",1
2905173,"The E alpha class II gene of the major histocompatibility complex is expressed in a variety of immunocompetent cells. Part of the control of tissue-specific expression is mediated by a block of sequences found far upstream of the transcriptional startsite; this stretch is necessary for expression in the B lymphocytes of transgenic mice, but largely dispensable elsewhere. We review the evidence for the role of this region in E alpha transcription in transgenic animals, as well as data from transfections into tissue-culture cells, which indicate that this region has non-specific enhancer activity. We discuss possible models to explain how a non-specific enhancer can participate in cell-specific control.",1
2883769,"Molecular studies on viral oncogenes and their products have led to the discovery of physiological proto-oncogenes, involved in the control of cell proliferation and gene activation. Other genetic and molecular investigations, initiated in Drosophila melanogaster and continued in different multicellular eukaryotes, have made evident the homoeotic genes, which are directly correlated with cell specialization, in the complex processes of differentiation and morphogenesis. Both gene classes are conserved to a high extent during evolution. They are involved in the eukaryotic mechanisms of differentiation control and proto-oncogenes, in particular, are related to malignant transformation. Some available data suggest a certain extent of relatedness between the gene products of both gene classes. A differentiation trigger model, including retroviral transposition, homoeotic genes and proto-oncogenes is discussed.",1
2879540,"Enhancer sequences analysed using the informational spectrum method (ISM) show a characteristic frequency at .0488.

2840348,"We have constructed a high-efficiency vector for expression of genes of interest in myeloma cells. This vector is comprised of regulatory sequences from immunoglobulin (Ig) genes, including the heavy-chain enhancer, a kappa light-chain promoter and splice site, and the polyadenylation signal downstream from the kappa constant region. The expression capacity of this vector was assayed in J558L myeloma cells using human tissue plasminogen activator as a reporter gene. Stable transfectants were analyzed for protein, RNA, DNA copy number and transcription rate. Expression was compared to that of intact, transfected Ig genes and to endogenous Ig. Tissue plasminogen activator cloned into this vector was found to be expressed as efficiently as intact, transfected Ig genes, producing 1-2% of total cellular mRNA from a single copy of the gene. RNA levels and transcription rates relative to those of endogenous Ig genes were found to be about 25% and 38%, respectively. Because of its high efficiency, potential for gene amplification, and various scale-up advantages of myeloma cells, this vector-host system may yield levels of desired proteins than currently available systems.",1
2832953,"The structure of an invertebrate, intron-containing globin gene has been determined as part of a study of the evolution of hemoglobin. The gene encoding chain c of Lumbricus terrestris hemoglobin has the two-intron, three-exon structure characteristic of vertebrate globin genes, and the exact positions of the splice junctions are conserved. The two introns interrupting the coding sequence are longer than those of known hemoglobins but shorter than myoglobin introns. The gene encodes a secretory preglobin containing a 16-residue signal peptide, as expected for an extracellular hemoglobin. However, no intron separates the DNA encoding the signal sequence from that of the globin sequence. The 3' untranslated region of the Lumbricus gene is much longer than those of the genes for other hemoglobins and is similar to those found for myoglobins.",0

2820585,"The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, the product of t(9:22), is the cytogenetic hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The c-abl oncogene on chromosome 9 is translocated to the Ph chromosome and linked to a breakpoint cluster region (bcr), which is part of a large bcr gene. This results in the formation of a bcr-c-abl fusion gene, which is transcribed into an 8.5 kb chimeric mRNA encoding a 210 kd bcr-c-abl fusion protein. The Ph chromosome is also found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). Although the c-abl is translocated and a new 190 kd c-abl protein has been identified, no breakpoints are observed in the bcr (Ph+bcr- ALL). Here we show that in Ph+bcr- ALL, breakpoints in chromosome 22 occur within the same bcr gene, but more 5' of the bcr. Cloning of a chimeric bcr-c-abl cDNA demonstrates that the fusion gene is transcribed into a 7 kb mRNA, encoding a novel fusion protein.",1
2731737,"A region spanning 25 kb of genomic DNA containing the kappa-casein gene, has been isolated from two genomic libraries in EMBL3 and EMBL4 phage vectors. Five phage clones containing kappa-casein gene have been found. Gene organisation has been determined using restriction mapping and a partial sequencing the 5' and 3' flanking regions. The kappa-casein gene includes 5 exons, the first of them coding for 64 nucleotides from the 5' untranslated mRNA zone. The gene is 12.5 kb long, which is almost 16 times longer than the corresponding mRNA. The first intron spans 2.5 kb, the second is the largest one and spans 5.5 kb. The 5' flanking region sequence has been analysed; it contains a TATA box from -30 to -25 bp, somewhat different from the canonic sequence, and a CAAT box at -80 bp.",0

2690608,"The history, biologic activity, and immunogenicity of human insulin are described. Recombinant human insulin first entered clinical trials in humans in 1980. At that time, the A and B chains of the insulin molecule were produced separately and then combined by chemical techniques. Since 1986, a different recombinant process has been used. The human genetic coding for proinsulin is inserted into Escherichia coli cells, which are then grown by fermentation to produce proinsulin. The connecting peptide is cleaved enzymatically from proinsulin to produce human insulin. Studies indicate that there are no important differences between pork insulin and human insulin in terms of therapeutic efficacy and disposition after intravenous administration. Recombinant human insulin has a faster onset of action and lower immunogenicity than pork or beef insulin. Diabetic patients may have an improvement in glucose concentrations when their therapy is switched from animal-source insulin to human insulin. Such a change usually requires a dosage adjustment, which must be determined by a physician. Pharmacists are responsible for educating patients concerning all insulin products and for preventing patients from interchanging insulin products. The availability of human insulin as the first pharmaceutical product manufactured through recombinant DNA technology, however, has had little effect on the pharmacist's role in the care of such patients. The production of human insulin through recombinant DNA technology represents an important advance in the treatment of patients with diabetes.",0
2689847,"Embryonic gene enhancers may be controlled by deheterochromatization of genes of trans-acting factors caused by altered methylation states of hypersensitive chromatin. Such specific chromatin sites would have a certain required helical pitch (X-type DNA). Non-core regions surrounding the enhancer motif would allow interactions with specific cell type promoters. Differences in embryonic and adult type genes may be reduced to these enhancer activities and certain trans-acting proteins effecting these genic control elements. Furthermore all spurious embryonic gene activities of neoplasms may also be due to such factors. Even pleotrophic and cascade phenomena in dysdifferentiation processes may be described in terms of enhancer mechanisms. Duplications of enhancer sequences may be fundamental to the potential of hyperactivity by embryonic type genes. Examples of this would be alpha-fetoprotein correlations with enhancer activity and possibly increased nucleolar organizer activity of embryonic cells. The manner by which chemical carcinogens would be involved with enhancer processes would be via ""key"" mechanisms that have been presented previously.",1
2684414,"SIR1, one of several genes required for repression of yeast silent mating type loci, has a unique role in repression of the HML alpha locus. Single-cell assays revealed that cells with mutant alleles of SIR1, including presumptive null alleles, existed as populations of genetically identical cells whose members were in one of two different regulatory states. A minority of cells had a repressed HML alpha locus whereas the majority had a derepressed HML alpha locus. The two states were mitotically stable, although rare changes in state were observed during mitotic growth, possibly reflecting heritable changes to the HML alpha locus at or before replication. Analysis of changes in state suggests that SIR1 protein has a role in the establishment but not the maintenance of repression of silent mating type genes, whereas SIR2, SIR3, and SIR4 are required for maintenance.",0
2679631,"In order to assess the contribution of the germline VH gene repertoire to antibody diversity, many groups have studied the evolution and the organization of the immunoglobulin VH gene locus in mice and humans.

2668336,"The treatment of choice for certain immunodeficiency syndromes and hematological disorders is bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The success of BMT is influenced by the degree of HLA compatibility between recipient and donor. However, aberrant expression of HLA sometimes makes it difficult, if not impossible, to determine the patient's HLA type by standard serological and cellular techniques. We describe here the application of new molecular biological techniques to perform high resolution HLA typing independent of HLA expression. A patient with HLA-deficient severe combined deficiency was HLA typed using in vitro amplification of the HLA genes and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization (SSOPH). Two major advances provided by this technology are:detection of HLA polymorphism at the level of single amino acid differences; and elimination of a requirement for HLA expression. Although the patient's lymphocytes lacked class II HLA proteins, polymorphism associated with DR7,w53;DQw2;DRw11a (a split of DR5), w52b (a split of DRw52);DQw7 were identified. The patient's class I expression was partially defective, and typing was accomplished by a combination of serological (HLA-A and -C) and SSOPH analysis (HLA-B). Complete patient haplotypes were predicted after typing of family members [A2;B35(w6); Cw4; DRw11a(w52b);DQw7 and A2;B13(w4); Cw6;DR7(w53); DQw2]. Potential unrelated donors were typed and a donor was selected for BMT.",1

An autopsy demonstrated absent right middle lobe of the lung, bilateral renal cysts, hypoplastic renal arteries, urethral stricture, hydronephrosis, and aortic coarctation. The brain was abnormal with absent olfactory tracts and cerebral and cerebellar heterotopias. This is the first report of a chromosome anomaly in a child with Fryns phenotype.

This locus is also part of the WAGR complex (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation). In one kindred, the translocation is associated with a deletion, and probes for this region were used to identify and clone the breakpoints of the translocation in the second kindred. Comparison of phage restriction maps exclude the presence of any sizable deletion in this case. Sequences at the chromosome 11 breakpoint are conserved in multiple species, suggesting that the translocation falls within the AN2 gene.",1

2452973,"Cosmid clones containing 250 kilobases of genomic DNA from the human amylase gene cluster have been isolated. These clones contain seven distinct amylase genes which appear to comprise the complete multigene family. By sequence comparison with the cDNAs, we have identified two pancreatic amylase genes and three salivary amylase genes. Two truncated pseudogenes were also recovered. Intergenic distances of 17 to 22 kilobases separate the amylase gene copies. Within the past 10 million years, duplications, gene conversions, and unequal crossover events have resulted in a very high level of sequence similarity among human amylase gene copies. To identify sequence elements involved in tissue-specific expression and hormonal regulation, the promoter regions of the human amylase genes were sequenced and compared with those of the corresponding mouse genes. The promoters of the human and mouse pancreatic amylase genes are highly homologous between nucleotide -160 and the cap site. Two sequence elements thought to influence pancreas-specific expression of the rodent genes are present in the human genes. In contrast, similarity in the 5' flanking sequences of the salivary amylase genes is limited to several short sequence elements whose positions and orientations differ in the two species. Some of these sequence elements are also associated with other parotid-specific genes and may be involved in their tissue-specific expression. A glucocorticoid response element and a general enhancer element are closely associated in several of the amylase promoters.",0
2401401,"The nucleotide (nt) sequences of the Sc3 and Sc4 genes of the filamentous fungus Schizophyllum commune, and the deduced amino acid (aa) sequences, were determined; moreover, the previously published sequence for the Sc1 gene [Dons et al., EMBO J. 3 (1984) 2101-2106] was corrected. All three independently isolated genes were found to have similar structures and nt sequences of their coding regions. At the aa level the homology is 43-62% (63-69% in the C-terminal parts of the proteins), the hydrophobic aa predominate and the hydrophobicity patterns are similar. All three proteins contain leader sequences and eight cysteines among about 110 aa, conserved at the same positions. Yet these genes are differentially regulated: Sc1 and Sc4 are only expressed at high levels in fruiting dikaryons, whereas Sc3 is highly expressed in both monokaryons and dikaryons, independent from fruiting.",0
2349097,"An intermediate stage in the process of eukaryotic RNA splicing is the formation of a lariat structure. It is anchored at an adenosine residue in intron between 10 and 50 nucleotides upstream of the 3' splice site. A short conserved sequence (the branch point sequence) functions as the recognition signal for the site of lariat formation. It has been generally assumed that the branch point is recognized mainly by the presence of its unique sequence where the lariat is formed. However, the known branch point consensus sequence is found to be distributed nearly randomly throughout the gene sequence with only a slightly higher frequency in the expected lariat region. Further, the known consensus sequence is found to be clearly inadequate to specify branch points. These observations have implications for understanding the mechanism of branch point recognition in the process of splicing, and the possible evolution of the branch point signal.",0
2338639,"A model is presented which uses the hardness and elastic moduli of brittle crystals, determined using the Vickers microindentation test, to predict the uniaxial compaction behavior of compacts. A general approach first developed in the materials science field to predict the densification of particulate matter under hydrostatic loading was followed. Modifications to account for the effects of particle geometry and the closed-die loading conditions were considered. The model predicted the densification behavior of sucrose and adipic acid. It did not predict the densification of acetaminophen as well; however, the discrepancy between the experimental and predicted values may arise either from error associated with the evaluation of the elastic modulus using the microindentation test or from error in calculating the relative density of compacts which were observed to have partially laminated. The effects of error both in the hardness value and in the ratio of punch to die-wall stress on the predictive capability of the model were also discussed briefly.",0
2227942,"Probe YNZ22 (D17S5) is a highly polymorphic, variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) marker previously shown to be deleted in all patients with the Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) but not in patients with isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS). Primers were constructed to the unique sequence flanking the polymorphic, repetitive region of YNZ22 for amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Analysis of 118 normal individuals revealed 12 alleles (differing in copy number of a 70-bp repeat unit) ranging in size from 168 to 938 bp. A retrospective study of eight MDS and six ILS patients was consistent with Southern blot analysis in all cases except one. In the latter, a very large allele (12 copies of the repeat unit) in a patient and her mother failed to amplify on initial attempts, but was successfully amplified by reducing the concentration of genomic DNA used in the reaction. Prospective studies on two MDS and five ILS patients were successfully performed and confirmed in all cases by Southern blot analysis. From the total sample, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was fully informative in four of ten MDS patients and showed a deletion in all four cases. Nine of eleven ILS patients were heterozygous and therefore not deleted for YNZ22. Development of primers for additional polymorphic markers in the Miller-Dieker region will lead to a rapid PCR-based diagnostic approach for all MDS and ILS patients. PCR typing of YNZ22 will also facilitate use of this marker in other applications, including genetic linkage, paternity and forensic studies, and analysis of loss of heterozygosity in tumors.",1
2135157,"The rheological properties of elastomeric impression materials are important because they are major determinants in the handling characteristics and adaptation to the soft and hard tissues of the mouth. Of particular interest is the rheology of the elastomeric impression materials as supplied by the manufacture since this strongly influences the ease with which the two pastes can be mixed and placed. Additionally, the flow characteristics of the mixed impression materials are also important as these will have an important bearing on the accuracy and reproduction of surface detail which are influenced by the working time. Generally, rheological properties can be defined as the study of the flow characteristics of viscos materials such as elastomeric impression materials. In the context of impression materials used in dentistry the variation of these flow characteristics over short time intervals is extremely important in the making of clinically acceptable impressions. The purpose of these studies were to measure a variety of rheological characteristic for the unmixed elastomeric impression materials and to relate this information to clinical dental procedures. The elastomeric impression materials used in this study were polysulfides, condensation cured silicone, addition cured silicone rubbers in common clinical use and specimens of adding increasing increments of filler (SiO2, TiO2 or PbO2) to a main constituent part (Thiokol LP2, Chloridparaffin, Silicone or Vinylsilicone) of each impression paste. The viscosity of these materials were measured by using the Ishida-Giken cone and plate high shear rheometer. The changes in shear stress with time were recorded for a shear rate of 5 s-1 at 23 degrees C. The relation of shear rate to shear stress were accomplished with a range of shear rates from 0 s-1 to 20 s-1. The viscosity behavior which were the flow characteristic, apparent viscosity, the yield value and the areas of hysterisis loop, were determined from both the shear stress-time and the shear stress-shear rate curves. The results of this study of elastomer impression material pastes have shown that: 1. All impression pastes exhibited non-Newtonian viscosity characteristic, apparent viscosity decreasing with increasing shear rate. 2. Surflex F base pastes (polysulfide rubber), Flexicone injection type base paste (condensation-cured silicone rubber) and Exaflex injection type base paste (addition cured silicone rubber) were pseudoplastic behavior, and other impression pastes were virtually thixotropic behavior. 3. All impression paste had yield value, especially Surflex F accelerator pastes which had a markedly higher yield value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0
2132126,"In order to analyze quantitative characters effectively, a gene (effective factor) model is established, which can describe the phenotypic distribution of a quantitative character in the segregating population quite well because it has not only involved the additive effect of genes, but has also considered the dominance deviation and epistatic deviation. In this paper, we also present a method to estimate the parameters of the model. Based on the results of some illustration, the proposed model is considered to be superior to Castle-Wright's formula, and it may provide more useful information to breeders.",0
2102098,"Faculty from six eastern health science schools, from Florida to Nova Scotia, developed a new series of group-learning units during 1983 and 1984 using a recently developed patient-oriented problem-solving approach. The purpose of the units was to teach problem solving by applying the concepts and principles of pharmacology to therapeutic problems, and to find ways to engage students actively in their learning of this material. The development team envisioned that these goals would be met by means of well-crafted teaching units that could be evaluated and, if acceptable, used by academic pharmacologists in their teaching. The units were developed, edited, reviewed by experts, and field-tested with students at the authors' schools; editing and publication were done by the study's sponsor, the Upjohn Company. The results of the field trials (which indicated no need for revisions of the units) showed that the units were well crafted and that the students had higher scores on tests of their knowledge of pharmacology after they had used the units.",0
2076244,"This study evaluated the compatibility of five polyvinyl siloxanes (Reflect, Exaflex, President, Permagum, and Extrude), one polysulfide (Permalastic) and one polyether (Polygel) impression materials with the new epoxy resin, AlphaDie 87. Only the polysulfide and the polyether were prepared with the ""super separator"". A line 20 microns wide was scribed into three glass dies (plates). Each nonaqueous elastomeric was used to make an impression of the line in each of the three glass dies. Each of the impressions was allowed to set in a water bath (36 degrees C). The epoxy die material was introduced onto the line surface of the impression to create a copy of the line. The epoxy was allowed to set against the impression. Detail reproduction of the line, or compatibility, was determined by the presence of the reproduced line on the epoxy specimen by three raters. There was unanimous agreement among the 63 independent homogenous ratings of line presence on impression specimens. The line was reproduced on all of the impression specimens but only in 71.4% (5/7) of the epoxy specimens. The epoxy specimens reproduced the line in all the polyvinyl siloxane specimens (5/5).",0
2055469,"Previous investigations on the human genome determined: (i) the base compositions (GC levels) and the relative amounts of its isochore families; (ii) the compositional correlations (i.e., the correlations between GC levels) between third codon positions of a set of genes and the DNA fractions in which the genes were localized; and (iii) the compositional correlations between (a) third and first + second codon positions, as well as that between (b) introns and exons from the set of 'localized genes' and from all the coding sequences and genes (genomic sequences of exons + introns) available in gene banks. Here, we have shown that the correlations (iii, a and b) for 'localized genes' and genes from the bank are in full agreement, indicating that the former set is representative of the latter. We have then used the data (i) and the correlation (ii) to estimate the distribution of genes in isochore families. We have found that 34% of the genes are located in the GC-poor isochores (which represent 62% of the genome), 38% in the GC-rich isochores (31% of the genome) and 28% in the GC-richest isochores (3% of the genome). There is, therefore, a compositional gradient of gene concentration in the human genome. The gene density in the GC-richest 3% of the genome is about eight times higher than in the GC-rich 31%, and about 16 times higher than in the GC-poorest 62%.",0

2005900,"Human platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (hPD-ECGF) is a novel angiogenic factor which stimulates endothelial cell growth in vitro and promotes angiogenesis in vivo. We report here the cloning and sequencing of the gene for hPD-ECGF and its flanking regions. This gene is composed of 10 exons dispersed over a 4.3-kb region. Its promoter lacks a TATA box and a CCAAT box, structures characteristic of eukaryotic promoters. Instead, six copies of potential Sp1-binding sites (GGGCGG or CCGCCC) were clustered just upstream of the transcription start sites. Southern blot analysis using genomic DNAs from several vertebrates suggested that the gene for PD-ECGF is conserved phylogenetically among vertebrates. The gene for hPD-ECGF was localized to chromosome 22 by analysis of a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrid lines.",1
1979484,"Numerous genes contain regulatory elements located many tens of kilobases away from the promoter they control. Specific mechanisms must be required to ensure that such distant elements can find and interact with their proper targets but not with extraneous genes.

These various examples of long-distance effects suggest that, in all cases, related forms of chromatin packaging may be involved.",0
1972029,"The underlying molecular basis for Bernard-Soulier Disease (BSD) is currently unknown. Platelets from patients with this autosomal recessive bleeding disorder have multiple abnormalities, including a markedly reduced von Willebrand factor-dependent adhesiveness due to a deficiency of the platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX complex. In the present studies, we have used an intragenic restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for Taq I in the GPIb alpha gene to study linkage between this gene and the inheritance of BSD in a family with two affected siblings. Whereas the proband was heterozygous, showing both the 0.7 and 4.0 kb bands of this polymorphism (A/B), her affected brother was homozygous for the 0.7 kb band (A/A). Accordingly, these siblings did not inherit the same pair of GPIb alpha alleles from their parents. Additionally, one child of the proband was A/A, while the second studied child was A/B, with neither showing any evidence of BSD. No construct of heterozygosity or homozygosity for GPIb alpha alleles in this family is consistent with a model in which one or more defective GPIb alpha alleles could produce BSD. RFLP analysis with BamHI or HindIII showed entirely normal patterns in the patients, indicating the absence of any gross deletion of the GPIb alpha gene. GPIb alpha mRNA from patient platelets was reverse transcribed and subsequently amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, demonstrating the presence of GPIb alpha transcript. Furthermore, trace amounts of GPIb could be shown on the surface of patient platelets. Based on these results, a defect in the GPIb alpha gene is unlikely to be the cause of BSD in this family.",1

1910683,"Transcriptional regulation of the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes is one of the best-studied systems for understanding tissue-restricted gene control. Dissection of the Ig genes reveals that each contains multiple regulatory elements that are preferentially active in B lymphocytes. These include a promoter and one or more enhancer elements. Biochemical analysis and cloning of the genes for transactivator proteins has uncovered a variety of distinct proteins that are often members of gene families. The transactivators themselves are under complex regulation at the transcriptional level as well as by interactions with other proteins in the cell. It appears that the coordinate action of a select constellation of these transactivators conveys the information for tissue-specific expression of the Ig genes.",1
1908020,"The present work represents the first attempt to study in greater detail previously proposed compositional correlations in genomes, based on a body of additional data relating to gene localizations as well as to extended flanking sequences extracted from gene banks. We have investigated the correlations that exist between (1) the GC levels of exons of human genes, and (2) the GC levels of either intergenic sequences or introns associated with the genes under consideration. In both cases, linear relationships with slopes close to unity were found. The similarity of the linear relationships indicates similar GC levels in intergenic sequences and introns located in the same isochores. Moreover, both intergenic sequences and introns showed GC levels 5-10% lower than the corresponding exons. The above findings considerably strengthen the previously drawn conclusion that coding and noncoding sequences (both inter- and intragenic) from the same isochores of the human genome are compositionally correlated. In addition, we find linear correlations between the GC levels of codon positions and of the intergenic sequences or introns associated with the corresponding genes, as well as among the GC levels of codon positions of genes.",0
1893878,"The gap genes play a key role in establishing pair-rule and homeotic stripes of gene expression in the Drosophila embryo. There is mounting evidence that overlapping gradients of gap gene expression are crucial for this process. Here we present evidence that the segmentation gene giant is a bona fide gap gene that is likely to act in concert with hunchback, Krüppel and knirps to initiate stripes of gene expression. We show that Krüppel and giant are expressed in complementary, non-overlapping sets of cells in the early embryo. These complementary patterns depend on mutually repressive interactions between the two genes. Ectopic expression of giant in early embryos results in the selective repression of Krüppel, and advanced-stage embryos show cuticular defects similar to those observed in Krüppel- mutants. This result and others suggest that the strongest regulatory interactions occur among those gap genes expressed in nonadjacent domains. We propose that the precisely balanced overlapping gradients of gap gene expression depend on these strong regulatory interactions, coupled with weak interactions between neighboring genes.",0
1870332,"Cross-linking of polyethylene (XLPE) has dramatically improved its properties in industrial applications, and it may also have some application in the field of human joint replacement. Additionally it has the advantage of permitting a lower molecular weight base material to be used, so that components may be injection moulded rather than machined. This study therefore investigates the wear resistance of medical grade cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE), cross-linked by a silane-grafting process, with a molecular weight between cross links of 5430 g mol(-1). This first report investigates the wear resistance of XLPE against itself, because for certain joints, such as the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, the material may have a high enough wear resistance to allow both bearing surfaces to be made from it. Tests were carried out both on a reciprocating pin and plate machine with pins loaded at 10 and 40 N and also on a new finger joint simulator, which simulates the loads applied to and the movements of, the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. An average wear rate of 1.8 x 10(-6) mm3 N-1 m-1 was found (range 0.9-2.75 x 10(-6) mm3 N-1 m-1). This is about six times greater than the wear rate of non-cross-linked ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) against stainless steel, but for applications with low loading, such as the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, this material is shown to have adequate wear resistance. The coefficient of friction was 0.1, which is similar to that of UHMWPE on stainless steel.",0
1870325,"A great deal of interest is being shown in complaint bearing surfaces for artificial joints. These produce very low friction because of the fluid-film lubrication that they exhibit, and therefore should produce lower wear than current prosthetic materials as the two surfaces of the joint are completely separated by a film of synovial fluid. However, one problem with soft elastic materials in vivo is that the elastomers may degrade with time. Specimens of four polyurethanes were kept in Ringer's solution at 37 degrees C for about 4 months to investigate changes in mechanical properties and the mode of lubrication with time of immersion. The materials tested were a polyether-urethane (E57), a polyester-urethane (E58), an aromatic polyether-urethane (P1) and an aliphatic polyether-urethane (A1). Samples of E57 showed a decrease in hardness and elastic modulus of 21% and 28% respectively. This was much better than E58 which showed decreases of 32% and 42% respectively. Better results were achieved with A1 (hardness change 2%) and P1 (decrease in hardness of 14% and modulus 17%). When tested in a hip-function simulator, A1 showed virtually no change in its very low coefficient of friction (0.004), P1 showed an increase of 60%, while E57 and and E58 both showed a doubling in friction over the course of the study. The modes of in vitro degradation were considered and surface effects determined to be most damaging. Currently the best candidate for a compliant material in hip replacement is the aliphatic polyether-urethane which maintains fluid-film lubrication.",0
1862096,"Genes at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in mammals are known to have exceptionally high polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium. In addition, these genes form highly complicated gene families that have evolved through gene conversion and unequal crossing-over. It has been shown recently that amino acid substitution at the antigen recognition site (ARS) is more rapid than synonymous substitution, suggesting some kind of positive natural selection working at the ARS. It is highly desirable to know the interactive effect of gene conversion and natural selection on the evolution and variation of MHC gene families. A population genetic model is constructed that incorporates both selection and gene conversion. Diversifying selection is assumed in which sequence diversity is enhanced not only between alleles at the same locus but also between duplicated genes. Expressed and nonexpressed loci are assumed as in the class I gene family of MHC, with gene conversion occurring among all loci. Extensive simulation studies reveal that very weak selection at individual amino acid sites in combination with gene conversion can explain the unusual pattern of evolution and polymorphisms. Here both gene conversion and natural selection contribute to enhancing polymorphism.",1
1851643,"The Spm's primary transcript is alternatively spliced to give at least 4 different transcripts which code for proteins with extensive overlapping domains. Two of these proteins, the tnpA and tnpD gene products, are necessary and sufficient to promote dSpm transposition in tobacco. Moreover, the tnpA gene product is also sufficient to suppress the basal level of expression observed in some dSpm-disrupted genes, and probably to activate the expression of inactive elements and of other dSpm-disrupted genes. The functions of the tnpB and tnpC gene products remain unknown. However, their structure suggests that they act as negative regulators of the Spm transposase function.",0
1807828,"The mating type of fission yeast is determined by the mat1 locus on chromosome II. The sequence content of this locus, and hence the mating type, is switched in a strictly regular pattern by transposition from one of two unexpressed mating type sequences. The expressed and the two silent sequences are located on the same chromosome. It is not understood how one of the two donor sequences is selected in this reaction. Here I test the possibility that the selection is governed by gene expression from the mat1 locus. Such a mechanism could favor transposition of a donor sequence of opposite mating type to the one present at mat1. Alternatively it could disfavor transposition of a synonymous sequence. The present data argue strongly against any type of participation of mat1 gene products in the choice of donor during the mating type switch. Alternative steering mechanisms are discussed.",0
1783385,"Human pancreatic lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) is a 56-kDa protein secreted by the acinar pancreas and is essential for the hydrolysis and absorption of long-chain triglyceride fatty acids in the intestine. In vivo, the 12-kDa protein cofactor, colipase, is required to anchor lipase to the surface of lipid micelles, counteracting the destabilizing influence of bile salts. Southern blot analysis, using a pancreatic lipase cDNA to probe DNA from mouse-human somatic cell hybrids, indicated that the pancreatic lipase gene (PNLIP) resides on human chromosome 10. In situ hybridization to human metaphase chromosomes confirmed the cell hybrid results and further localized the gene to the 10q24-qter region with the strongest peak at q26.1.",1

1741034,"Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a human autosomal recessive disorder, is characterized by extreme sensitivity to sunlight and high incidence of skin cancers. XP cells are defective in the incision step of excision repair of DNA damaged by ultraviolet light. Cell fusion studies have defined seven XP complementation groups, XP-A to XP-G. Similar genetic complexity of excision repair is observed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutations in any one of five yeast genes, RAD1, RAD2, RAD3, RAD4, and RAD10, cause a total defect in incision and an extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet light. Here we report the characterization of the yeast RAD14 gene. The available rad14 point mutant is only moderately ultraviolet-sensitive, and it performs a substantial amount of incision of damaged DNA. Our studies with the rad14 deletion (delta) mutation indicate an absolute requirement of RAD14 in incision. RAD14 encodes a highly hydrophilic protein of 247 amino acids containing zinc-finger motifs, and it is similar to the protein encoded by the human XPAC gene that complements XP group A cell lines.",1
1714415,"We have used transgenic mice to study the influence of position of the human globin genes relative to the locus control region (LCR) on their expression pattern during development. The LCR, which is located 5' of the globin gene cluster, is normally required for the activation of all the genes. When the human beta-globin gene is linked as a single gene to the LCR it is activated prematurely in the embryonic yolk sac. We show that the correct timing of beta gene activation is restored when it is placed farther from the LCR than a competing human gamma- or alpha-globin gene. Correct timing is not restored when beta is the globin gene closest to the LCR. Similarly, the human gamma-globin gene is silenced earlier when present farthest from the LCR. On the basis of this result, we propose a model of developmental gene control based on stage-specific elements immediately flanking the genes and on polarity in the locus. We suggest that the difference in relative distance to the LCR, which is a consequence of the ordered arrangement of the genes, results in nonreciprocal competition between the genes for activation by the LCR.",1
1672111,"We have cloned and sequenced a homolog (ht-en) to the Drosophila engrailed (en) gene from the glossiphoniid leech, Helobdella triserialis. Amino acid comparisons of the ht-en homeodomain and C-terminal residues with the corresponding residues encoded by en-class genes of other species reveal 75-79% sequence identity. In addition, the ht-en sequence appears to have a serine-rich region 16 residues C-terminal from the homeodomain, which by analogy to Drosophila may be a target site for phosphorylation. The leech gene encodes some amino acid substitutions for residues that are highly conserved in other species. These are found within the second and third of the three putative helices of the homeodomain, and in both of the intervening turn regions.",0
1656527,"Wilms tumor has been associated with genomic alterations at both the 11p13 and 11p15 regions. To differentiate between the involvement of these two loci, a chromosome 11 was constructed that had one or the other region deleted, and this chromosome was introduced into the tumorigenic Wilms tumor cell line G401. When assayed for tumor-forming activity in nude mice, the 11p13-deleted, but not the 11p15.5-p14.1-deleted chromosome, retained its ability to suppress tumor formation. These results provide in vivo functional evidence for the existence of a second genetic locus (WT2) involved in suppressing the tumorigenic phenotype of Wilms tumor.",1
1644672,"Studies involving the effects of single genes on quantitative traits may involve closed populations, selection may be practiced, and the quantitative trait of concern may also be influenced by background genes that are inherited in a polygenic manner. It is shown analytically that analysis of such data by ordinary least squares, the usual method of analysis, can lead to finding an excess of spurious significant effects of single genes, when no effect exists, for both randomly and directionally selected populations and can lead to bias in estimates of single-gene effects when selection has been practiced. The bias depends on heritability of the polygenic effects on the trait, selection intensity, mode of inheritance, magnitude of gene effect, gene frequency, and data structure. It is argued that when genotypes of individuals can be identified for all individuals with observations on the trait, use of mixed-model procedures under an animal model treating single-gene effects as fixed effects can provide unbiased estimates of single-gene effects and exact tests of associated hypotheses for pedigreed populations, even when selection is practiced. Results are illustrated through computer simulation.",0
1619647,"We have developed a hierarchical rule base system for identifying genes in DNA sequences. Atomic sites (such as initiation codons, stop codons, acceptor sites and donor sites) are identified by a number of different methods and evaluated by a set of filters and rules chosen to maximize sensitivity; these are combined into higher-order gene elements (such as exons), evaluated, filtered and combined as equivalence classes into probable genes, which are evaluated and ranked. The system has been tested on an extensive collection of vertebrate genes smaller than 15,000 bases. Results obtained show that, on average, 88% of the predicted coding region for a transcription unit is actually coding, and 80% of the actual coding is correctly predicted. This will, in most applications, be sufficient for a search against protein sequence databases for the identification of probable gene function. In addition, the system provides a general test platform for both gene atomic site identification and the rules for their evaluation and assembly.",0
1616958,"The c-myc protooncogene plays an important role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Selective downregulation of c-myc expression induces differentiation of leukemic cells, whereas constitutive overexpression prevents differentiation of the same cell types. The c-myc gene is comprised of three exons, the first of which is largely untranslated. Both c-myc mRNA and the c-myc gene product have very short half-lives, resulting in a very sensitive regulation of this important gene. Both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of the c-myc gene expression have been documented. Transcriptional regulation can occur at the level of transcriptional initiation or elongation. A number of c-myc promoter-binding proteins have been identified and characterized. These include positive and negative regulatory factors. It appears that the c-myc gene is very tightly regulated in response to positive and negative growth stimuli.",1

1526980,"The alpha globin gene locus of the common gibbon (Hylobates lar) was isolated, and it contains two closely linked alpha globin genes that share the same arrangement as that found for the homologous genes of other catarrhine primates. The nucleotide sequences of the gibbon alpha globin genes were determined and compared with the alpha globin gene sequences from other primate species (human, chimpanzee, orangutan, baboon, and rhesus); the prosimian primate, galago, alpha A and alpha B globin genes provided the out-group for this analysis. The degree of divergence for both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions among the alpha globin genes are generally smaller for intraspecies than interspecies comparisons, which is indicative of concerted evolution between the paired alpha globin genes of each catarrhine species. The pattern of differences is suggestive of gene conversions. This possibility is supported by both site-by-site and branch-swapping parsimony analyses. The site-by-site parsimony analysis was also used to determine the 3' boundary of each catarrhine species-specific conversion. These alpha globin gene conversion events encompass most of the transcriptional region, including the promoter, exons, introns, and about one-half of the 3'-untranslated region. However, the paired gibbon alpha globin genes show the highest degree of divergence, differing by five nucleotides in their coding regions, three of which encode amino acid replacement substitutions. It appears that the last convergence event between the paired gibbon alpha globin genes is relatively ancient, having occurred approximately 11 million years ago. The remaining 3'-untranslated region and flanking DNAs show no evidence of involvement in any recent conversion event as the parsimony analysis of these sequences group all the alpha 1 globin genes of the different catarrhine species into one clade and all the alpha 2 globin gene of these species into a separate clade. The sequence comparison among the alpha globin genes of different primate species also provides interesting implications regarding the evolution and functional domains of the 3'-untranslated regions.",0

To identify the causative mutations in five TAT alleles cloned from three RHS patients, chimeric genes constructed from normal and mutant TAT alleles were tested in directing TAT activity in a transient expression assay. DNA sequence analysis of the regions identified as nonfunctional revealed six different point mutations. Three RHS alleles have nonsense mutations at codons 57, 223, and 417, respectively.

1347149,"Here we report the identification and characterization of a gene defect causing Waardenburg's syndrome with hearing loss in a large Brazilian family. This demonstrates a mutation causing Waardenburg's syndrome as well as a mutation causing a form of congenital deafness. The mutation was found in the HuP2 gene, a member of the paired domain family of proteins that bind DNA and regulate gene expression. The mutation occurred in 100% of the cases with the disease in this family and was absent in a random sample of 50 unrelated control subjects. Identification of the Waardenburg's syndrome gene and future characterization of its gene product is likely to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disorder and may allow prevention of deafness of this type.",1
1200027,"Close phenotypic similarity between two cases carrying a rec(3) dup q,inv(3) (p25q21), 12 additional infants from the same inv (3)(p25q21) kindred who lived less than 1 year, and eight cases studied in other medical centers has led us to postulate the existence of a distinct chromosome 3 duplication-deletion syndrome. In the presence of trisomy for (3)q21 leads to qter and monosomy for (3)p25 leads to pter, the facial dysmorphy is unique: a distorted head shape due to irregular cranial sutures, thick low eyebrows, long eyelashes, persistent lanugo, distended veins on the scalp, hypertelorism, oblique palpebral fissures, a very short nose with a broad depressed bridge and anteverted nares, protruding maxilla, thin upper lip, micrognathia, low-set ears, and a short webbed neck. Port-wine stains, congenital glaucoma, cloudy corneas, cleft palate and harelip also occur frequently. Each infant has difficulty sucking and swallowing. Congenital anomalies of the cardiovascular system, of midgut rotation, and of the urogenital system are noted for the infants who died neonatally. Most frequent is a ventricular septal defect, followed by atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, patent foramen ovale, and coarctation of the aorta. Omphalocele, umbilical hernia, hyperplastic kidneys, polycystic kidneys, double ureter, hydro-ureter, hydronephrosis, and undescended testes often occur. The extremities are short in proportion to the length of the trunk. Clinodactyly, coxa valga, talipes, and spina bifida are frequently observed.",1
1190735,"A new approach for detecting and estimating quantitative linkage which uses sibship data is presented. Using a nested analysis of variance design (with marker genotype nested within sibship), it is shown that under the null hypothesis of no linkage, the expected between marker genotype within sibship mean square (EMSbeta) is equal to the expected within marker genotype within sibship mean square (EMSe), while under the alternative hypothesis of linkage, the first is greater than the second. Thus the regular F-ratio, MSbeta/MSe, can be used to test for quantitative linkage. This is true for both backcross and intercross matings and whether or not there is dominance at the marker locus. A second test involving the comparison of the within marker genotype within sibship variances is available for intercross matings. A maximum likelihood procedure for the estimation for the recombination frequency is also presented.",0
1016229,"This article describes an investigation of inter- and intraspecific variation in three small populations of wild Canidae-wolf, coyote, and dingo. The products of 53 gene loci were examined. Very little interspecies variation was observed, but the level of intraspecific variation was compatible with that found in man.",0
854041,"In small and moderate sized inbred strains the variation with regard to the frequency of lethal heterozygotes is of such a magnitude that it is almost impossible to predict the degree of heterogeneity from one generation to another. This was shown from computer simulations of the generational variation in inbred strains maintained by full-sib matings at different breeding regimes. The results are discussed in relation to Haldane's theoretical derivations and to the practical implications with regard to strain keeping and to design and evaluation of experiments.",0
827284,"A number of biochemical and genetic features shared by aldehyde oxidase and pyridoxal oxidase in Drosophila melanogaster indicate a close relationship between these enzymes. The present work shows that probable structural genes for these enzymes are within about 0.08 map unit of each other. Comparison with intensively studied regions of the genome suggests that this value is of the order of magnitude expected for adjacent functional units. Despite this close linkage, there is no indication of coordinate expression of the two enzymes. These results are consistent with the idea that each structural gene is under control of its own regulatory region, but alternative explanations are possible.",0
743192,"Nucleoside transport in sheep erythrocytes is under the genetic control of two allelomorphic genes (NuI and Nui), where NuI codes for the functional absence of a high-affinity nucleoside transport system and is dominant to the gene (Nui) coding for the presence of the transport system. Kinetic and inhibitor experiments show that the high-affinity transport system is not present in heterozygous erythrocytes, demonstrating that the NuI gene is completely dominant over the Nui gene. It is suggested that the Nu locus may not represent the structural gene locus of the nucleoside transport system. Instead, it may be a regulator gene locus.",1
715457,"Resistance of mouse cells to the folate analog, methotrexate, results from selection of increasingly resistant cells on progressive increases of methotrexate in the culture medium. High-level resistance is associated with high rates of synthesis of dihydrofolate reductase and correspondingly high numbers of reductase genes. In some variants high resistance and gene copy number are stable in the absence of selection pressure, whereas in others they are unstable. Analogies are made to antibiotic and insecticide resistance wherein selection of organisms with increased capacity to counteract the drug effect results in emergence of resistance. Gene amplification may underlie many such resistance phenomena.",0
698273,"General idea of a gene as a part of the hereditary molecule DNA permits to correlate various alleles states of a gene to various energy states of the hereditary molecule. Hereditary molecule under the action of a random force moves along its energy states. So far as the number of individuals in a population usually is very big, such motion of a gene in energy space resembles random motion of the Brownian particle in liquid. Here the process of striving hereditary molecule for minimum potential energy will correspond to the slow precipitation of particles under the effect of the force of gravity. Therefore, gene diffusion in energy space is described by the Focker--Plank's equation. The solution of this equation shows the time evolution of the distribution of genes alleles states within the limits of an isolated population.",0
650344,"An infant with a family history suggestive of immunodeficiency presented with combined immunodeficiency. No HLA-A and -B antigens were present on lymphocyte and platelet surfaces, but they were found in the serum. HLA-D determinants were present on lymphocytes. In spite of a fetal thymus transplantation, the infant died of infections associated with the immunodeficiency. The thymus and lymphoid organs were present but hypoplastic and contained few lymphocytes at postmortem examination. The finding of an immodeficiency associated with an absence of cell-surface HLA-A and -B antigens may be regarded as the consequence of the lack of cellular histocompatibility antigens on immune development. Alternatively, other membrane components may have also been defective and partly responsible for the observed abnormalities.",1
637368,"The population genetics of Trivers (1974) concept of parent-offspring is examined for species in which the effects of the conflict are felt by future half-sibs, as in promiscuous mating systems in which the male shows no parental care. Whether or not a rare conflictor gene will spread in a non-conflictor population depends on f(m) greater than (m + 1)/(0.5m + 1.5) for a dominant gene, and on f(m) greater than 1/4(7 + 3) for a recessive gene; f(m) is the fitness gained by a conflictor relative to a non-conflictor offspring [f(m) greater than 1], and m is the amount of parental investment taken by a conflictor relative to m = 1 for a non-conflictor. The ESS value for conflict (mo) in promiscuous species with zero male parental care has mo = f(mo)/4[df(mo)/dmo]. However, where the male maintains the same harem for several breeding seasons, or where there is promiscuity but both sexes contribute equally to parental care, conditions for conflict are equivalent to monogamy.",1
575746,"The dependency of probabilities of phenotypic concordance of gene frequencies in three-allele genetic systems is presented. A graphical display enables the rapid comparison of the relative effectiveness of different systems, taking into account dominance relationships within each genetic system. Four or more allele systems can also be approximated, while two-allele systems are considered to be special cases of three-allele ones.",0
472761,"In each of six family members who were heterozygous at the X-linked locus for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, only one or the other of the two alleles at that locus was almost exclusively expressed. The data are consistent with evidence that X-chromosome inactivation is a random process that may be followed by selection for one of the two resulting cell types on the basis of an unknown gene, which is located on the X chromosome and which can affect the rate of proliferation of hemopoietic cells in humans.",1
268322,"A model of assortative mating incorporating partial dominance is proposed for a single locus with two alleles. It is derived by starting from an arbitrary genotypic distribution and finding symmetric and non-selective mating frequencies which duplicate this distribution. Numerical values are imputed to genotypes, the homozygotes having numerically equal values, opposite in sign, and the heterozygote having a value determined by the gene and heterozygote frequencies. The model is specified in a canonical form which reveals the correlation between mates based on genotypic values, and relates the correlation to the fixation index. It permits negative as well as positive values of the fixation index. It is shown that this general model includes several particular cases, in equilibrium phase, occurring in the literature.",0
100192,"It has been suggested that gene regulation may play a critical role in adaptive evolution. However, gene regulation has proved to be most refractory to experimental investigation in multicellular organisms. Using specially constructed stocks of Drosophila melanogaster, we have demonstrated the following. (1) The existence in natural populations of ample variation in regulatory genes that modify the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), an enzyme coded by a structural gene locus, Adh, located on the second chromosome; the regulatory genes are located on the third chromosome, and thus are not adjacent to the structural locus. (2) The regulatory genes act not by means of post-transcriptional or post-translational modification of the gene product, but rather by controlling the number of ADH molecules; this is consistent with the hypothesis of gene regulation by means of macromolecules specifically binding at control sites adjacent to the structural gene locus. (3) The variation in regulatory genes is adaptively significant; adaptation to higher levels of environmental alcohol takes place not by changes in the Adh structural locus, but by changes in regulatory genes that control the number of ADH molecules in the organisms. Our results provide direct evidence of the importance of gene regulation in eucaryotic evolution.",0
7276,"Since the current system for the regulation of drugs in the United States was established in 1962, the FDA has steadily increased the scope of its responsibilities and activities, and, concomitantly, the regulatory burden on drug developers. The costs and time that are required for drug development have spiralled upwards. Reform of drug regulation is necessary; it must be fundamental in nature, and it must come from outside the agency through new legislation.",0
